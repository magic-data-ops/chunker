You are proposing a question and extracting an initial partial answer from a seed document chunk.

CATEGORY: {{CATEGORY}}
CATEGORY DESCRIPTION: {{CATEGORY_DESCRIPTION}}
{% if SEED_ENTITY %}SEED ENTITY (focus disambiguation around this): {{SEED_ENTITY}}
{% endif %}
SEED CHUNK (chunk_id: {{CHUNK_ID}}):
---
{{CHUNK_TEXT}}
---

TASK:
1. Generate one question that fits the CATEGORY above. The question must be answerable (at least partially) using information in this chunk, but should ideally require additional evidence from other chunks.
2. Extract the partial answer that can be inferred from this seed chunk alone.
3. Assess whether this seed chunk fully answers the question:
   - If YES: end your partial answer with exactly the token [COMPLETE]
   - If NO (more chunks needed): end your partial answer with exactly the token [CONTINUE]

OUTPUT FORMAT (fill in each field):
QUESTION: <your question here>
PARTIAL_ANSWER: <partial answer extracted from the seed chunk> [COMPLETE|CONTINUE]

Rules:
- The question must be a single sentence ending with "?"
- Do NOT include both [COMPLETE] and [CONTINUE] — choose exactly one
- For category "single_chunk_factoid", always end with [COMPLETE]
- For categories "multi_hop_reasoning" and "entity_disambiguation", prefer [CONTINUE] unless the chunk is genuinely self-sufficient
