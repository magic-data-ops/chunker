You are analyzing 200.txt, which is around 50000 lines to help me generate evaluation prompts for my LLM. 
Each prompt I generate evaluates a single capability, which is denoted with "category".

Category: "Disambiguates distinct entities with identical or near-identical names across context."

Look at the source and give me relevant content on this so that I can create an eval prompt that will evaluate our LLM on the given category.

Also, provide the golden responses to the prompts, too.
