      Questions testing whether the model can locate a specific piece of
      information within the Enron email corpus and accurately cite the
      sender, recipient, date, subject line, or FILE reference from the
      source email.

  - name: hierarchy_comprehension
    display_name: "Ability to comprehend the hierarchy structure of a long text source"
    description: >
      Questions that require understanding the hierarchical organization of
      email data — e.g., distinguishing original messages from replies and
      forwards, understanding CC chains and reporting structures, parsing
      nested email threads, or identifying organizational hierarchy from
      sender/recipient patterns.

    display_name: "Tracks entity state changes across long, interleaved histories"
    description: >
      Questions requiring the model to track how an entity (person, project,
      deal, or organizational unit) changes state across multiple interleaved
      emails — e.g., a person's role changes across the company, a deal's
      progression through negotiation stages, or a project's status updates
      scattered across different mailboxes.

    display_name: "Disambiguates distinct entities with identical or near-identical names across context"
    description: >
      Questions requiring the reader to distinguish two or more entities
      sharing the same or near-identical name across different emails,
      departments, contexts, or time periods within the Enron email corpus —
      e.g., people with the same last name in different divisions, or the
      same project name used for different initiatives.

  - name: multi_hop_reasoning
    display_name: "Performs multi-hop reasoning across documents that are widely separated in context"
    description: >
      Questions whose complete answer requires synthesizing facts from two or
      more non-adjacent emails that are widely separated in the corpus. No
      single email is sufficient to answer the question — the model must
      connect information across different senders, threads, or time periods.

  - name: semantic_deduplication
    display_name: "Deduplicates semantically identical information expressed differently across multiple sources"
    description: >
      Questions testing whether the model can identify that two or more emails
      from different senders or threads express the same information, fact, or
      directive using different wording (e.g., the same announcement forwarded
      and restated by multiple people), and produce a deduplicated answer
      rather than treating them as distinct information.

  - name: temporal_ordering
    display_name: "Reconstructs accurate temporal ordering from events scattered non-chronologically across context"
    description: >
      Questions requiring the model to reconstruct the correct chronological
      sequence of events (emails sent, decisions made, meetings scheduled,
      deals progressed) that appear out of order across different mailboxes
      and email threads in the corpus.

  - name: domain_scoping
    display_name: "Correctly scopes information to its domain of applicability"
    description: >
      Questions testing whether the model correctly limits information to its
      proper domain of applicability — e.g., distinguishing internal
      communications from external, legal department matters from trading
      floor operations, company policy from individual opinion, or one
      business unit's decisions from another's.

    display_name: "Prioritizes information sources by recency, authority, or specificity when context contains superseded content"
    description: >
      Questions requiring the model to identify which of multiple conflicting
      or overlapping emails takes precedence based on recency (later email
      correcting earlier), authority (executive directive vs. peer suggestion),
      or specificity (direct communication vs. forwarded summary).

    description: >
      Questions requiring the model to perform arithmetic — counting emails,
      summing financial amounts, tallying participants, computing date
      differences, or aggregating other numerical data scattered across
      multiple emails in the corpus.

    description: >
      Questions requiring the model to identify and fairly present multiple
      conflicting viewpoints, contradictory directives, or disagreements
      across different emails and senders, synthesizing them into a balanced
      analysis rather than choosing one side.
