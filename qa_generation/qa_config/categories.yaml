      Questions requiring the model to synthesize information from multiple
      widely separated passages within California state case law to produce
      a coherent, unified answer that no single passage could provide alone.

    description: >
      Questions testing whether the model can locate a specific piece of
      information within a large corpus and accurately cite the case name,
      volume, page number, year, or other identifying metadata from the source.

    description: >
      Questions that require understanding the hierarchical organization of
      legal text — e.g., distinguishing majority opinions from dissents,
      headnotes from holdings, procedural posture from substantive rulings,
      or nested statutory references within case opinions.

    description: >
      Questions requiring the model to track how a legal entity (party, statute,
      property, or legal standard) changes state across multiple interleaved
      passages — e.g., a party's legal status through successive proceedings,
      or a property's chain of title across multiple transactions.

    description: >
      Questions requiring the reader to distinguish two or more entities sharing
      the same or near-identical name across different cases, contexts, domains,
      or time periods within the California case law corpus.

    description: >
      Questions whose complete answer requires synthesizing facts from two or
      more non-adjacent passages that are widely separated in the corpus. No
      single passage is sufficient to answer the question.

    display_name: "Deduplicates semantically identical information expressed differently across multiple sources"
    description: >
      Questions testing whether the model can identify that two or more passages
      from different cases express the same legal principle, fact, or holding
      using different wording, and produce a deduplicated answer rather than
      treating them as distinct information.

    description: >
      Questions requiring the model to reconstruct the correct chronological
      sequence of events (filings, rulings, amendments, transactions) that
      appear out of order across different passages in the corpus.

    description: >
      Questions testing whether the model correctly limits a legal principle,
      statute, or ruling to its proper domain of applicability — e.g.,
      distinguishing civil from criminal standards, state from federal
      jurisdiction, or one area of law from another.

    description: >
      Questions requiring the model to identify which of multiple conflicting
      or overlapping sources takes precedence based on recency (later case
      overruling earlier), authority (Supreme Court vs. appellate), or
      specificity (narrow holding vs. broad dictum).

      Questions requiring the model to perform arithmetic — counting cases,
      summing damages, averaging time periods, or computing other numerical
      aggregates — across multiple passages scattered throughout the corpus.

    description: >
      Questions requiring the model to identify and fairly present multiple
      conflicting legal viewpoints, dissenting opinions, or contradictory
      holdings across different cases, synthesizing them into a balanced
      analysis rather than choosing one side.
