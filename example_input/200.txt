[Constitution, article VI, section 2.]

SEC. 2. The Supreme Court shall consist of a chief justice and six associate justices. The Court may sit in departments and in Bank, and shall always be open for the transaction of business. There shall be two departments, denominated, respectively, Department One and Department Two. The chief justice shall assign three of the associate justices to each department, and such assignment may be changed by him from time to time. The associate justices shall be competent to sit in either department, and may interchange with each other by agreement among themselves, or as ordered by the chief justice. Each of the departments shall have the power to hear and determine causes, and all questions arising therein, subject to the provisions hereinafter contained in relation to the Court in Bank. The presence of three justices shall be necessary to transact any business in either of the departments, except such as may be done at chambers, and the concurrence of three justices shall be necessary to pronounce a judgment. The chief justice shall apportion the business to the departments, and may, in his discretion, order any cause pending before the Court to be heard and decided by the Court in Bank. The order may be made before or after judgment pronounced by a department; but where a cause has been allotted to one of the departments, and a judgment pronounced thereon, the order must be made within thirty days after such judgment, and concurred in by two associate justices, and if so made it shall have the effect to vacate and set aside the judgment. Any four justices may, either before or after judgment by a department, order a case to be heard in Bank. If the order be not made within the time above limited, the judgment shall be final. No judgment by a department shall become final until the expiration of the period of thirty days aforesaid, unless approved by the chief justice, in writing, with the concurrence of two associate justices. The chief justice may convene the Court in Bank at any

(v) vi ORGANIZATION OF SUPREME COURT.

time, and shall be the presiding justice of the court when so convened. The concurrence of four justices present at the argument shall be necessary to pronounce a judgment in Bank; but if four justices, so present, do not concur in a judgment, then all the justices qualified to sit in the cause shall hear the argument; but to render a judgment, a concurrence of four judges shall be necessary. In the determination of causes, all decisions of the Court in Bank or in departments shall be given in writing, and the grounds of the decision shall be stated. The chief justice may sit in either department, and shall preside when so sitting, but the justices so assigned to each department shall select one of their number as presiding justice. In case of the absence of the chief justice from the place at which the Court is held, or his inability to act, the associate justices shall select one of their own number to perform the duties and exercise the powers of the chief justice during such absence or inability to act. # SUPERIOR COURT JUDGES.

[S. F. No. 11654. In Bank.—December 15, 1926.]

BANK OF ITALY (a Corporation), Petitioner, v. JOHN FRANKLIN JOHNSON, as Superintendent of the State Banking Department of the State of California, Respondent.

[1] BANKS AND BANKING—REGULATIONS—POLICE POWER.—The business of banking affects so intimately the commercial welfare and business interests of the people as to render it a proper subject of regulation by the state in the exercise of the police power.

[2] Id.—LIMIT OF REGULATIONS—CONSTITUTION.—The power of the state to regulate banking business is supreme, subject to no limitation so far as the fourteenth amendment to the constitution of the United States is concerned, except that such regulation must be reasonable.

[3] Id.—BRANCH BANKS—PROHIBITION AND REGULATION OF.—Since the state may prohibit branch banks entirely, it may make and enforce any regulations short of prohibition, provided the same be reasonable and uniform.

[4] Id.—BANK ACT—ESTABLISHMENT OF BRANCH BANKS—DISCRETION OF SUPERINTENDENT OF BANKS—PUBLIC CONVENIENCE AND ADVANTAGE.—Under the bank act (Stats. 1909, p. 88), a bank is prohibited from establishing or maintaining a branch office, either in the city of the head office or elsewhere in the state, except upon the written approval of the superintendent of banks, which (a) may be given or withheld in his discretion, and (b) shall not be given by him until he has ascertained to his satisfaction that the public convenience and advantage will be promoted by the opening of the branch office.

1. See 4 Cal. Jur. 106; 3 R. C. L. 379.
2. See 4 Cal. Jur. 106.

200 Cal.—1
(1) 2 BANK OF ITALY v. JOHNSON. [200 Cal.

[5] Id.—PERMITTING BRANCH BANKS—LEGISLATIVE POLICY.—The question of permitting branch banks at all is one of legislative policy on the part of the state.

[6] Id.—DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY—SECTION 9 OF BANK ACT.—The discretion vested in the superintendent of banks by section 9 of the bank act is a lawful delegation of authority to him, but such authority is not without its limitations in law, independent of the statute and in the statute itself, and includes the limitation that the discretion shall be exercised impartially and in such manner as not to infringe upon any constitutional rights of an applicant.

[7] Id.—ADOPTION OF RULES—CURTAILING DISCRETION.—The superintendent of banks may not by the adoption of any rule or policy or procedure so circumscribe or curtail the exercise of his discretion under the statute as to prevent the free and untrammeled exercise thereof in every case, for an attempt to do so would be for him to arrogate to himself a legislative function.

[8] Id.—EXERCISE OF DISCRETION—TIME.—The superintendent of banks may not refuse to exercise the discretion conferred upon him by the bank act when called upon to do so by an application duly presented to him, but must act upon such application within a reasonable time.

[9] Id.—PUBLIC CONVENIENCE AND ADVANTAGE—DETERMINATION OF.—The legislature has not attempted to define the phrase "public convenience and advantage," as used in section 9 of the bank act, and it is the duty of the superintendent of banks, in the exercise of his power, to ascertain the facts in each case, in which he performs an executive or administrative function and not a judicial one.

[10] Id.—DUTY OF SUPERINTENDENT—DETERMINATION OF PUBLIC CONVENIENCE AND ADVANTAGE—EXTENT OF INTEREST.—In determining the question of public convenience and advantage, on an application to establish a branch bank, the superintendent of banks should first consider the interest of the public immediately contiguous to the proposed branch bank or of the public reasonably subject to service by it, but he may take into consideration the question whether the convenience and advantage of the people of the entire state would be promoted or retarded by the unlimited establishment of state-wide branch banks.

[11] Id.—DE NOVO RULE—GUIDE FOR DEPARTMENT—VALIDITY OF.—The rule called the "de novo rule," adopted by the superintendent of banks, providing in effect that any bank whose main office is located within the limits of a city will be permitted to extend into other parts of that city with branches, on application to the superintendent of banks, and without acquiring another bank, but Dec. 1926.] BANK OF ITALY v. JOHNSON. 3

any bank located within a city desiring to extend a branch into another city of the state where competition now exists will be required to acquire an existing bank before the request will be granted, subject to exceptions within the discretion of the superintendent, is but a declaration of policy on the part of the superintendent of banks, which is within his power to prescribe, as a rule or guiding consideration of his department, and as a notice to applicants as to the showing necessary to be made.

[12] Id.—ADMINISTRATIVE BOARDS AND OFFICERS—RULES AND REGULATIONS.—The authority of an administrative board or officer, such as the superintendent of banks, to adopt reasonable rules and regulations which are deemed necessary to the due and efficient exercise of the powers expressly granted cannot be questioned. This authority is implied from the power granted.

[13] Id.—FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD—CONTIGUOUS TERRITORY RULE.—The rule of the Federal Reserve Board known as the "contiguous territory rule," providing that that board will as a general principle restrict the establishment of branches, agencies, or additional offices by its member banks or trust companies to the city of location of the parent bank and the territorial area within the state contiguous thereto, as said territory has been defined in the board's previous resolution, excepting in instances where the state banking authorities have certified and the board finds that public necessity and advantage render a departure from the principle necessary or desirable, is a proper administrative regulation.

[14] Id.—ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICER OR BOARD—PROMULGATION OF RULES—POWER.—An executive or administrative officer or board may not, in the promulgation of rules, change, alter, amend, or extend his or its statutory powers.

[15] Id.—"DE NOVO RULE"—DISCRETION OF SUPERINTENDENT OF BANKS.—The so-called "de novo rule" of the superintendent of banks does not assume to lay down a general rule legislative in character limiting the exercise of the discretion reposed in him by section 9 of the bank act. The word "require," as contained in the rule, cannot be construed to have a meaning materially different from the statutory word "promoted."

[16] Id.—APPLICATION FOR BRANCH BANK PERMITS—MANDAMUS—PLEADING.—In a proceeding in mandamus to compel the superintendent of banks to issue to the petitioner certain permits for the establishment and maintenance of branch banks in certain places, the petition for the writ is vulnerable as against a general demurrer where it is not alleged therein that the capital and

14. See 21 Cal. Jur. 872. 4 BANK OF ITALY v. JOHNSON. [200 Cal.

surplus of the petitioner were at the time of making said applications equal to or in excess of the amount required by section 9 of the bank act for the opening of said branches or that such facts were known to the respondent, or that the petitioner had paid or tendered for payment the fees required by said section 9, or that the petitioner had presented all of the essential facts to the respondent upon which he might properly exercise his discretion, or that the respondent was in possession of the facts of his own knowledge from which the only reasonable conclusion could be drawn that the public convenience and advantage would be promoted by the granting of said applications. These omitted allegations, or the substance thereof, were essential to state a cause of action against the respondent.

[17] Id.—AMENDMENTS TO PETITION—SUFFICIENCY OF.—In such a case, where in advance of a ruling on the demurrer, the petitioner introduced its evidence on the theory that all matters essential to state a cause of action were in issue and the respondent introduced evidence to meet the petitioner's showing thereon, and the petitioner thereafter, by permission of court, filed amendments to the petition supplying the omitted allegations essential to state a cause of action, under the circumstances, the respondent is entitled to have a ruling on his demurrer, and it is held that the petition as amended states a cause of action and the demurrer is overruled.

[18] Id.—PLEADING—DENIALS.—In such a case, where the respondent in his answer denied the material allegations of the petition which are in controversy, under the practice, the allegations of the amendments filed to conform to the proof are deemed denied.

[19] Id.—DENIAL OF APPLICATION—REASONS FOR.—The reasons assigned by the superintendent of banks for the denial of applications for permits for branch banks do not preclude him from thereafter setting up and relying upon any and all legal reasons for denying the same in a proceeding in mandamus to compel him to issue said permits.

[20] Id.—REASONS FOR DENIAL—FINDING OF PUBLIC CONVENIENCE AND ADVANTAGE.—In such a case, where the petitioner by its pleading and proof has thrown the case wide open on the question of whether as a matter of law on the face of the record and regardless of the "de novo rule," the respondent was compelled to find that the public convenience and advantage would be promoted by the opening of said branches, reasons assigned previously by the respondent in denying said applications should not be held to be determinative of the rights of the parties.

18. See 21 Cal. Jur. 189. Dec. 1926.] BANK OF ITALY v. JOHNSON. 5

[21] Id.—MANDAMUS—DISCRETIONARY POWERS.—It is the general rule that the writ of mandamus may not be employed to compel a public officer possessing discretionary power to act in a particular way. The court in such a proceeding may compel him to act, but it may not substitute its discretion for the discretion vested in such officer. An important exception to the rule, however, is that if the facts as admitted or proved be susceptible of but one construction or conclusion the right to the writ becomes a matter of law and the officer may be compelled to act in accordance with the facts as admitted or established.

[22] Id.—EVIDENCE—PUBLIC CONVENIENCE AND ADVANTAGE.—In an original proceeding in mandamus in the supreme court to compel the superintendent of banks to issue certain permits to the petitioner for the establishment of branch banks in certain localities, where the court is called upon to determine the character and sufficiency of the evidence to justify the writ as against the respondent, it is governed by the rule that if there be any substantial evidence in the record which would have supported a conclusion on the part of the respondent that public convenience would not be promoted by the opening of such branches, the writ must be denied.

[23] Id.—DISCRETION OF BOARDS OR COMMISSIONERS—INTERFERENCE WITH BY COURTS.—When subordinate boards or commissioners are by statute invested with discretion with respect to the exercise of their powers, courts will not interfere with such discretion in the absence of grave reasons tending to show that fraud, corruption, improper motives, or influences, plain disregard of duty, gross abuse of power, or violation of law entered into or characterized the determination of such body.

[24] Id.—LETTER FROM SUPERINTENDENT OF BANKS—ADMISSIBILITY OF. In this proceeding in mandamus to compel the superintendent of banks to issue permits for branch banks at certain places, it is held that a letter written by the respondent to the Federal Reserve Board, with reference, among other things, to the former's previous granting of a permit to the petitioner for a branch bank at a certain place, was properly admitted in evidence.

[25] Id.—ABSENCE OF PERMIT FROM FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD—INSUFFICIENT REASON FOR DENIAL OF WRIT.—In such a proceeding, the fact that the Federal Reserve Board has not granted its permission to the petitioner to open branch banks at the locations in question is not a sufficient reason for denying the writ, as the Federal Reserve Board is an official body entirely independent of any

21. See 16 Cal. Jur. 809.
23. See 21 Cal. Jur. 891. 6 BANK OF ITALY v. JOHNSON. [200 Cal.

state authority, and the statutory powers and duties of the superintendent of banks should be exercised and discharged independently of any authority having no lawful jurisdiction over him.

PROCEEDING in Mandamus to compel the Superintendent of Banks to issue permits for certain branch banks. Writ denied.

The facts are stated in the opinion of the court.

Cullinan & Hickey and Garret W. McEnerney for Petitioner.

James M. Oliver and Elbert W. Davis for Respondent.

Thelen & Marrin, *Amici Curiae*.

SHENK, J.—This is an original proceeding in mandamus to compel the respondent superintendent of banks to issue to the petitioner two permits for the establishment and maintenance of branch banks in the city of Los Angeles, one for a branch at North Spring Street and Sunset Boulevard, and the other for a branch in the Building of the Women's Athletic Club at No. 833 South Flower Street.

The petition was filed on June 18, 1925, and an alternative writ was issued, returnable on September 15th. On the return day the respondent filed a demurrer on the ground that the petition did not state sufficient facts to entitle the petitioner to the relief sought and at the same time filed an Dec. 1926.] BANK OF ITALY v. JOHNSON. 7

answer which, in the opinion of counsel for petitioner, presented issues of fact requiring the taking of testimony. By stipulation, concurred in by the court, Mr. B. Grant Taylor, clerk of this court, was appointed commissioner with the understanding that he should not submit findings on the evidence taken before him, but that the court should make its own findings and draw its own conclusions from the record. It was also agreed that after the evidence was taken and filed the matter should be set down for oral argument. The evidence was taken from time to time before the commissioner, both in San Francisco and in Los Angeles. The hearings were protracted, the last occurring in San Francisco on March 22, 1926. The commissioner thereupon filed a transcript of the evidence which comprises 1,925 pages of oral testimony and 227 exhibits. The matter was set down for oral argument and was argued on April 9 and 10, 1926. On the request of counsel for both sides permission was granted to file briefs, the last one being filed by the petitioner on September 1, 1926. Thereafter, on application of petitioner, but over the objection of respondent, the court, on October 4th, granted leave to file amendments to its petition, which were intended in the main to conform to the proof as counsel for petitioner construed the proof to be, but such leave was granted of course without prejudice to the rights of the respondent in the premises. The matter was thereupon ordered submitted for decision.

The insistence of counsel for respondent that his general demurrer is well taken renders it necessary to determine first the sufficiency of the facts as alleged by the petitioner. In the first cause of action in its original petition it was alleged among other things that the petitioner is a banking corporation incorporated in August, 1904, under the laws of this state with its principal place of business in the city and county of San Francisco; that it is authorized by its articles of incorporation to establish and maintain branch offices in the city and county of San Francisco and elsewhere throughout the state; that on February 1, 1923, the respondent was appointed and became and ever since has been the duly qualified and acting superintendent of banks of the state banking department of the state of California as provided for in an act entitled "An act to define and regulate the business of banking" and known as the Bank Act (Stats. 1909, p. 87), 8 BANK OF ITALY v. JOHNSON. [200 Cal.

and amendments thereto; that there are and for some years last past have been two general systems or methods of branch banking sanctioned by law in California, one known as state-wide branch banking, by which a bank maintains its principal office in one city and branches in other cities or towns within the state, and the other known as city-wide branch banking, by which a bank maintains branches in the city in which its principal place of business is located; that banks which do not maintain branches are known as unit banks; that certain banks in San Francisco and Los Angeles, including the petitioner, have adopted a branch banking system for areas beyond the territorial limits of the city in which the principal place of business is located and that the petitioner first entered upon that field and thus far has embarked upon a more extensive area than any other of such banks doing the same branch banking business; that with the exception of petitioner no bank with branches, the principal place of business whereof is north of thirty-seven degrees north latitude (which runs through the extreme southern portion of Gilroy), has established or applied for permission to establish any branch south of said line of latitude and no bank with branches, the principal place of business whereof is south of said line of latitude, has established or applied for permission to establish a branch north of said line of latitude; that both state-wide and city-wide branch banking are authorized by said bank act and have received the approval of the superintendent of banks.

The petition then set forth generally the reasons from the viewpoint of petitioner why as a matter of economic policy state-wide branch banking should be favored, and the status of petitioner as a sound financial institution which conducts a well managed and highly profitable banking business; that with the written approval of respondent or his predecessors in office the petitioner has heretofore opened seventy-eight branch banks in sixty-two cities and towns in the state other than the city and county of San Francisco, many of which are north and many south of the latitude aforesaid; that it maintains six branches in various parts of the city of Los Angeles; that five of said branches were authorized by the respondent's predecessor in office and the sixth required the written approval of the respondent; that of the branch banks opened and maintained by petitioner all were acquired Dec. 1926.] BANK OF ITALY v. JOHNSON. 9

by the purchase of existing banks with the exception of twenty, which were newly established, that is to say, were established where no bank had theretofore been conducted, and were and are banking offices commonly known as *de novo* branches. The petitioner then set forth tabulations showing the names of eight of the leading metropolitan banks in San Francisco, Oakland, and Los Angeles and the number of branches maintained by them by purchase and *de novo*. By comparison it is seen that the petitioner maintains ten more branches than the highest in that group of eight and has established a greater proportion of branches by purchase or merger than any bank in the group.

It was next alleged that the petitioner now maintains a branch office on the southwest corner of Temple and Spring Streets in the city of Los Angeles known as its International Branch. This bank was acquired in September, 1917, and before that time was an established and widely patronized independent bank at the same location; that the city of Los Angeles has instituted proceedings to condemn the property on which that branch bank is located, and that by reason thereof said branch must be moved to another location; that with said necessity in view the petitioner applied for and was, by respondent, granted permission to remove said branch bank from its present location to No. 214 North Main Street, which is across the street on Main Street from the present location. In its application for said removal the petitioner also applied for an additional branch at North Spring Street and Sunset Boulevard, a distance of about four blocks northerly from the location of the present international branch office. This application was denied by the respondent and the petitioner now seeks by this proceeding to compel the respondent to grant said application and in that behalf alleges that public convenience and advantage require and would be promoted by the opening of a branch bank at the corner of North Spring Street and Sunset Boulevard, and that unless said permission be granted much business conducted at its present location will be diverted to other banks and public convenience and advantage will be retarded and averted; that there is and has been no evidence of any substantial character justifying the conclusion that the public convenience and advantage would not require or be promoted by the opening of said branch bank and that 10 BANK OF ITALY v. JOHNSON. [200 Cal.

the action of the respondent in denying permission to open a branch bank at said new location "was arbitrary and capricious and without support whatever in reason"; that the respondent "ever since his incumbency began on February 1, 1923, has administered his office upon the theory that his decisions were and are to be controlled, and the exercise of his discretion confided to him by section 9 of the Bank Act, is limited by and subordinate to and controlled by a rule of his office commonly called and sometimes herein spoken of as the de novo rule"; that Mr. Jonathan S. Dodge, the respondent's immediate predecessor in office, promulgated said rule and throughout his term declared the same to be a valid rule of and within the state banking department; that continuously and ever since the respondent's induction into office he has announced his adherence to said rule and he has promulgated and maintains the same as a valid rule of the state banking department; that in denying the application for said branch the respondent was controlled wholly and solely by said self-imposed de novo rule; that it is the claim of the petitioner that there is no statute which gives authority for the promulgation of said rule and that if authority to make and enforce a rule of that character has been given by the legislature such legislation would have been unconstitutional as involving unlawful delegation of legislative power; that in denying said application the respondent did not question the fact that public convenience and advantage would be promoted by the granting thereof and did not find that the public convenience or advantage would not be promoted thereby; that the respondent interprets the said de novo rule to mean that occasions might and could arise wherein the public convenience and advantage would be promoted by the granting of a permit, but that under the rule the public convenience and advantage must require the granting of such permit; that if the word "require" be interpreted to mean anything essentially different from the words "will be promoted" in section 9 of the bank act the said rule would be invalid for this additional reason: that at the time of the making of said application and ever since the public convenience and advantage did require and they do now require the granting thereof; that since November 1, 1921, 103 permits for the establishment of branches de novo within the city of Los Angeles to five of the princi- Dec. 1926.] BANK OF ITALY v. JOHNSON. 11

pal banks of said city have been granted; that during that period no permit for the establishment of a branch de novo has been granted to the petitioner within that city except the San Pedro branch, and during said period the petitioner made no other applications to the respondent for permission to establish de novo branches within the city of Los Angeles except the application for the branches involved in this proceeding; that the granting of said 103 permits to the said five banks, which are all competitors of petitioner in the city of Los Angeles, has enabled said competitors to secure great advantages over the petitioner in obtaining new business and in the accommodation to customers of the banks of the city of Los Angeles; that public convenience and advantage would have been promoted and the business of petitioner would have been benefited by the establishment of de novo branches in the city of Los Angeles since November 1, 1921, but the petitioner refrained from making application for permits with the exception of the application for the branch at San Pedro and the branches involved in this proceeding because the petitioner believed that such applications would be denied by the incumbent superintendent of banks for the reasons involved in the de novo rule, for he in terms has held that the public convenience and advantage would not be promoted by the establishment of such branches, thereby putting upon the petitioner the burden of attacking the determination of the incumbent superintendent of banks as involving abuse of discretion and arbitrary exercise of power, an issue in which the petitioner was disinclined to become embroiled but that longer forbearance has become intolerable.

As and for a second cause of action the petitioner alleged that on February 28, 1925, it made application in writing to respondent for his written approval to establish a de novo branch in the building occupied by the Women's Athletic Club, situated at No. 833 South Flower Street; that on March 17, 1925, the respondent in writing denied said application; that the same was denied "solely upon the ground that the location of the proposed branch office is outside the limits of the city in which is located the principal place of business of the applying bank," meaning thereby that under the de novo rule the petitioner could not obtain permission to establish branch offices in the city of Los Angeles. The allegations in the first cause of action with reference to pub- 12 BANK OF ITALY v. JOHNSON. [200 Cal.

lie convenience and advantage, evidence concerning the same, the action of respondent and the *de novo* rule, were incorporated in the second cause of action by reference.

In order to determine the sufficiency of the facts so stated by the petitioner it is necessary to examine the law applicable to the establishment and regulation of branch banks in the state of California and to the powers and duties of the superintendent of banks in the premises. In the progress made in the industrial and economic world within comparatively recent years the business of banking has ceased to be, if indeed it ever was, a purely private enterprise. [1] Such business affects so intimately the commercial welfare and business interests of the people as to render it a proper subject of regulation by the state in the exercise of the police power (*People v. Bank of San Luis Obispo*, 154 Cal. 194 [97 Pac. 306]). The public patronage which the banker invites and receives is of such a character that he becomes in a just sense the trustee of the fiscal affairs of the people of the state (*State Savings & Commercial Bank v. Anderson*, 165 Cal. 437 [L. R. A. 1915E, 675, 132 Pac. 755]). [2] The power of the state to regulate banking business is supreme, subject to no limitation so far as the fourteenth amendment to the constitution of the United States is concerned, except that such regulation must be reasonable (*State Savings & Commercial Bank v. Anderson*, supra, affirmed in 238 U. S. 611 [59 L. Ed. 1488, 35 Sup. Ct. Rep. 792, see, also, *Rose's U. S. Notes*]. See 4 Cal. Jur., p. 106 et seq.). [3] Since the state may prohibit branch banks entirely it may make and enforce any regulations short of prohibition provided the same be reasonable and uniform. It is appropriate to note that under section 90 of the bank act foreign corporations entitled by law to act as trustees in this state are absolutely prohibited from establishing or maintaining, "directly or indirectly, any branch office or agency in this state" (Stats. 1917, p. 601).

Prior to 1909 the state of California had no thoroughgoing law regulating state banking business. Following the general financial depression of 1907 the preparation and adoption of a comprehensive banking law seemed imperative. With the co-operation of the legislative committee of the California Bankers' Association a bill was drafted and passed by the legislature (Stats. 1909, p. 87). That act has Dec. 1926.] BANK OF ITALY v. JOHNSON. 13

been amended at numerous sessions of the legislature since its original adoption but without any fundamental change in its purport. The act embraces within its regulatory provisions two main subjects of the banking business, departmental banking and branch banking. Within the former field of activity is included the savings, commercial, and trust departments of state banks, but with regulations in that field we are not here concerned. The issues involved in this proceeding directly concern the regulatory provisions of the act relating to branch banking, and particularly the following portion of section 9 thereof:

"No bank in this state, or any officer or director thereof, shall hereafter open or keep an office other than its principal place of business, without first having obtained the written approval of the superintendent of banks to the opening of such branch office, which written approval may be given or withheld in his discretion, and shall not be given by him unless he has ascertained to his satisfaction that the public convenience and advantage will be promoted by the opening of such branch office." (Stats. 1909, p. 88.)

[4] The foregoing provision was incorporated in the original act and has remained unchanged. It is at once observed that there is no uncertainty or ambiguity in the language of the portion of section 9 above quoted. It contains a prohibition of the establishment or maintenance of a branch office, either in the city of the head office or elsewhere in the state, except upon the written approval of the superintendent of banks which (a) may be given or withheld in his discretion, and (b) shall not be given by him until he has ascertained to his satisfaction that the public convenience and advantage will be promoted by the opening of the branch office. [5] It is undeniable that the question of permitting branch banks at all is one of legislative policy on the part of the state. In seventeen states all branch banking is prohibited by law, although in some of said seventeen states the prohibition does not apply to branches established prior to the passage of the prohibitory legislation. Typical legislation prohibiting all branch banking is the statute of Illinois, which was passed by both houses of the legislature, signed by the Governor and later submitted to and approved by a vote of the electors of the state under referendum law on November 4, 1924. This prohibitory statute 14 BANK OF ITALY v. JOHNSON. [200 Cal.

is found in Smith-Hurd Illinois Revised Statutes of 1925, at page 177, and is as follows: "No bank shall establish or maintain more than one banking house, or receive deposits, or pay checks at any other place than such house; and no bank shall establish or maintain any branch bank, branch office or additional office or agency for the purpose of conducting any of its business." In six states the law is silent on the subject but branch banking is prohibited under rulings of the attorney-general or the banking commissioner. In five states the law is silent; there is no ruling by the attorney-general or banking department, but no branches are in operation in those states. In nine states branch banking is authorized but is confined to the city of the bank's head office. In two states county-wide branch banking is authorized, and in nine states state-wide branch banking is permitted. The foregoing data is obtained from exhibit 217, which is a transcript of the hearing before the committee on banking and currency in the House of Representatives of the sixty-eighth Congress, first session, on H. R. 6855, of which committee the Honorable Louis T. McFadden of Pennsylvania is chairman. This measure involves, among other things, the scope of proposed federal permission and regulation of branch banking by national banks. An examination of the record of such hearings discloses that the subject of branch banking is fraught with great public interest, is highly controversial, and is wise or unwise dependent upon the particular viewpoint of those affected, or to be affected, by such regulations, existing or proposed.

California is one of the nine states in which state-wide branch banking is permitted. To say that the bank act of this state "gives the right to establish a branch at any point in the state," as contended for by the petitioner, does not correctly reflect the meaning of our statute. Rather it should be said that all branch banking is prohibited in this state with the proviso that a branch bank may be opened at any point in the state upon the written approval of the superintendent of banks, which he may grant or deny in his discretion, and he is specifically enjoined from granting his permission unless and until he has ascertained that the public convenience and advantage will be promoted thereby.

[6] We do not understand the petitioner seriously to claim that the discretion vested in the superintendent of Dec. 1926.] BANK OF ITALY v. JOHNSON. 15

banks by said section 9 is an unlawful delegation of authority to that official. Indeed, the exercise of a similar discretion by state officials having authority over banks has been upheld in other jurisdictions. (People v. Brady, 268 Ill. 192 [108 N. E. 1009]; Schaake v. Dolley, 85 Kan. 598 [Ann. Cas. 1913A, 254, 37 L. R. A. (N. S.) 877, 118 Pac. 80]; State v. State Securities Com., 145 Minn. 221 [176 N. W. 759]; State v. State Securities Com., 149 Minn. 102 [182 N. W. 910]; In re Commercial State Bank, 105 Neb. 248 [179 N. W. 1021]; Matter of Lunghino & Sons, 176 App. Div. 285 [163 N. Y. Supp. 9]; Mulkey v. Bennett, 95 Or. 70 [186 Pac. 1115]; Commonwealth v. Puder, 261 Pa. 129 [104 Atl. 505]; Mee v. Hirning, 45 S. D. 582 [189 N. W. 675]; State v. Hill, 84 W. Va. 468 [100 S. E. 286]. See, also, Engel v. O'Malley, 219 U. S. 128 [55 L. Ed. 128, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 190].) The petitioner has cited no authority holding that such discretion may not lawfully be vested in an executive or administrative officer of the state banking department. We therefore conclude that the discretion so lodged in the superintendent of banks in this state is a lawful delegation of authority to him. But such authority is not without its limitations in law independent of the statute and in the statute itself. Included in the limitations in law independent of the statute is that the discretion thus conferred shall be exercised impartially and in such manner as not to infringe upon any constitutional right of an applicant. [7] It is also clear that the superintendent of banks may not by the adoption of any rule of policy or procedure so circumscribe or curtail the exercise of his discretion under the statute as to prevent the free and untrammeled exercise thereof in every case, for an attempt to do so would be for him to arrogate to himself a legislative function. [8] Another limitation in law is that the superintendent of banks may not refuse to exercise the discretion thus conferred when called upon to do so by an application duly presented to him, but must act upon such application within a reasonable time. The statutory limitation on his authority to act is that he is prohibited from granting his written approval unless and until he has ascertained that the public convenience and advantage will be promoted by the opening of the branch bank permission to establish which is sought. 16 BANK OF ITALY v. JOHNSON. [200 Cal.

[9] The legislature has not attempted to define the phrase "public convenience and advantage." Nor has it attempted to declare where or how or under what circumstances the public convenience and advantage would or would not be promoted by the opening of a branch bank in any particular case. The obvious reason for the omission to define the phrase is because it would seem to be impossible to define it so that the definition would comprehend every variety and set of circumstances surrounding each particular application for the facts and circumstances in each case would necessarily be different, at least so far as local conditions were concerned. So, too, it is impossible for the court to lay down any hard-and-fast rule that would be applicable to every case, and the ingenuity and resourcefulness of counsel have not suggested how or in what manner a general rule could be devised. The phrase would seem to be as difficult of definition as "police power," "public convenience and necessity," "due diligence," or "probable cause," as those expressions are used in our law. But the impossibilities of definition do not detract in the least from the necessity of undertaking the task and of ascertaining the facts in each case, and it is for the superintendent of banks to so proceed and to ascertain them in the exercise of his power. In that exercise he performs an executive or administrative function and not a judicial one.

[10] Furthermore, the legislature has not attempted to indicate whether in the use of the word "public" in the phrase "public convenience and advantage" reference was thereby made to the people of the state at large or to the people of the particular portion of the public affected or to be served by the particular branch bank sought to be established. We incline to the view that the interest of the public immediately contiguous to the proposed branch bank or of the public reasonably subject to service by the proposed branch should first be considered by the superintendent of banks, but we are not prepared to hold that the superintendent of banks may not in the administration of the duties imposed upon him take into consideration the question whether the convenience and advantage of the people of the entire state would be promoted or retarded by the unlimited establishment of state-wide branch banks. Dec. 1926.] BANK OF ITALY v. JOHNSON. 17

He is a state-wide officer and as such is not limited by the statute to purely local considerations in passing upon any application for his written authority. Such being the fact, we do not feel justified in laying down a rule that would remove from his consideration all questions of state-wide policy in the administration of his office.

[11] With the foregoing observations as to the scope and effect of section 9 of the bank act, and of the powers of the superintendent of banks thereunder, we pass to a consideration of the history, authority and construction of the *de novo* rule promulgated by the respondent's predecessor in office and thereafter adhered to.

Since the adoption of the bank act in 1909 it has been the general policy of the successive superintendents of banks not to permit the establishment of branch banks outside the city of the head office except by purchase of or merger with an existing bank in such outside city or town. As this policy was adhered to and enforced it was realized that the restriction should not be deemed inflexible or absolute, but that exceptions should be made in proper cases when in the discretion of the superintendent of banks such exceptions should be made. The respondent's immediate predecessor in office, Mr. Jonathan S. Dodge, appears to have been the first to formulate the policy into a written rule of the state banking department. On his own initiative Mr. Dodge called a conference of the legislative committee of the California Bankers' Association and after discussing with them the necessities of the banking situation in California explained the rules which he proposed to set in motion. Thereafter he carried his plan into execution. On November 22, 1921, he addressed a letter to Mr. Leo V. Belden, vice-president of petitioner at San Francisco, wherein he stated in part: "In the conference with the legislative committee, the matter of the allocation of branch banks in California was discussed very fully by all present. After hearing all sides of the matter, I have decided that the policy of my department will be as follows: First: Any bank whose main office is located within the limits of a city will be permitted to extend into other parts of that city with branches, on application to the superintendent of banks, and without acquiring another

200 Cal.—2 18 BANK OF ITALY v. JOHNSON. [200 Cal.

bank. Second: Any bank located within a city, desiring to extend a branch into another city of the state where competition now exists, will be required to acquire an existing bank before the request will be granted. This rule will be subject to exceptions such as I made in your behalf at Sacramento, and I hope the exceptions will be few. . . . Fourth: All banks that may be members of the Federal Reserve Bank will be required to secure the consent of that institution before any franchises are authorized. . . . I think I said to you that the calling of this conference was occasioned by conditions in Southern California, and in no wise related to the activities of your bank." Mr. Dodge appeared as a witness in this proceeding and was interrogated by counsel for petitioner as to the history and origin of the de novo rule. He was asked to explain the circumstances and conditions which caused him to promulgate it and he answered: "As Superintendent of Banks, it was a very live question at that time about the establishment of branches, particularly of branches in small cities; and the bankers, the independent bankers in the small cities, were very much exercised for fear that their territory would be invaded by branches of big banks, and that their business would be sacrificed thereby. The first big contest, I guess, came on probably at Santa Maria and the second was at Sacramento, and after we had hearings on these two, other requests came in for branches, particularly one at San Pedro. I saw that some plan, method or rule should be laid down that would govern the establishment of banks in other cities and in other localities than the main office, and I had prepared what I thought was a good rule to follow, and which is practically stated in that letter [referring to letter of November 22, 1921, above referred to], and I called together the legislative committee of the Bankers' Association of the State of California in meeting, and presented it to them, and discussed with them the advisability of making it one of the rules for the governing policy of the State Banking Department of California. And that was held in the latter part of November, about the time this letter was written, probably a few days prior to it." He was then asked why he formulated that rule and he answered: "Well, it was pretty nearly necessary in order to have any sort of Dec. 1926.] BANK OF ITALY v. JOHNSON. 19

comfort in the office of the Superintendent of Banks. It was necessary. It had to come. I won't say that I was the first man who ever thought of the de novo rule. I guess that my predecessors in office had thought of it and would have established it. I can't say. Perhaps I was the first man that wrote it out and put it in words. Probably that is the truth of the matter." He was asked: "Well, now, was this rule adopted as the result of an agreement, or was it a dictated rule—dictated by you as Superintendent of Banks?" and he answered: "It was dictated by me, yes, sir. This is the rule of the Banking Department." This general policy was adhered to by Mr. Dodge during the remainder of his administration. When the respondent came into office on February 1, 1923, he continued in adherence to the same policy. The legislature was then in session and certain amendments to the bank act had been proposed by the California League of Independent Bankers, the purpose of which, among other things, was to provide by law that "no branch banking system shall maintain more than one office in any municipality other than that wherein is located the parent office." At the request of the California League of Independent Bankers these proposals were transmitted to the members of the executive committee of the California Bankers' Association, which was composed of eleven officers and representatives of leading banks in the state, including Mr. W. R. Williams, cashier of the petitioner. Thereafter a conference was held between the respondent and said executive committee at which it was agreed that it would be advisable to leave the statutory provision as incorporated in section 9 of the bank act unchanged, but that the state banking department should continue to adhere to the policy announced in the de novo rule. This plan was agreeable to all of the representatives of the California League of Independent Bankers and to the members of the executive committee of the California Bankers' Association with the exception of the representative of the petitioner. Thereafter the respondent announced the continuance of the policy of his department with reference to branch banking as set forth in the rules promulgated by his predecessors in office and first reduced to writing by Mr. Dodge. The rule as announced by the respondent 20 BANK OF ITALY v. JOHNSON. [200 Cal.

was in more condensed form and was and is as follows: "No branch of any bank shall be created in any locality other than the city or locality in which is located the principal place of business of such bank except by purchase of, or consolidation or merger with, an existing bank in such city or locality in which it is desired to create or establish such branch bank, unless the superintendent of banks in his discretion shall find that the public convenience and advantage require it."

[12] It is the contention of petitioner that the adoption of and adherence to the said *de novo* rule is an unlawful assumption of legislative power. The authority of an administrative board or officer, such as the respondent, to adopt reasonable rules and regulations which are deemed necessary to the due and efficient exercise of the powers expressly granted cannot be questioned. This authority is implied from the power granted. The petition concedes and states the rule to be that if the power "had not been expressly but merely implied the result would be the same for whatever is necessarily or plainly implied in a statute is as much a part of it as that which is expressed." (*Johnston v. Baker*, 167 Cal. 260 [139 Pac. 86].) In *St. Charles State Bank v. Wingfield*, 36 S. D. 493 [155 N. W. 776], cited and relied upon by petitioner, the court held invalid a certain rule adopted by the superintendent of banks in South Dakota, but guarded its ruling by the following language: "In holding this particular rule promulgated by the public examiner to be void, we are not to be understood as denying the public examiner full authority to adopt and promulgate any rule or regulation necessary or proper in the discharge of particular administrative duties imposed by statute. In all such matters he may properly exercise reasonable discretion in the adoption of reasonable rules within the purview of the particular provision of the statute which imposes the duty. . . . By way of illustration, the statute imposes upon the public examiner the duty and authority to approve banks as reserve depositaries. In the discharge of this duty, he may adopt any reasonable rule as to the method of procedure or the showing required, upon which such approval will be given." Under the authority of the National Bank Act the controller of the currency, as shown by exhibit Dec. 1926.] BANK OF ITALY v. JOHNSON. 21

216 herein, has adopted rules and regulations relating to the establishment of offices by national banks. It is interesting to note that among those rules is one that a "national bank will be permitted to establish such an office only within the limits of the city, town or village named in its organization certificate as the place where its operation of discount and deposits are to be carried on," and also upon a showing to the controller that the facts and conditions make it necessary to establish such office. [13] Likewise, the Federal Reserve Board has adopted a rule governing its member banks and known as the "contiguous territory rule," which provides: "The Federal Reserve Board will as a general principle restrict the establishment of branches, agencies or additional offices by such banks or trust companies to the city of location of the parent bank and the territorial area within the state contiguous thereto, as said territory has been defined in the Board's resolution of November 7, 1923, excepting in instances where the state banking authorities have certified and the Board finds that public necessity and advantage render a departure from the principle necessary or desirable." The resolution defining the term "contiguous territory" defines the same as "the territory of a city or town whose corporate limits at some points coincide with the corporate limits of the city or town in which the parent bank is located." The petitioner is a member of the Federal Reserve System and it does not appear that such a rule is not a proper administrative regulation.

[14] It is contended by petitioner and is well established that an executive or administrative officer or board may not, in the promulgation of rules, change, alter, amend, or extend his or its statutory powers. [15] But petitioner contends that the *de novo* rule assumes to lay down a general rule legislative in character limiting the exercise of the discretion reposed in the respondent by section 9 of the bank act. In consonance with the foregoing concededly correct rule it is obvious that if the word "require" as contained in the rule be deemed to have a meaning materially different from the statutory word "promoted" and as such would have the effect of restricting the statutory powers of the superintendent of banks such rule would be invalid. The word "require" is defined to 22 BANK OF ITALY v. JOHNSON. [200 Cal.

mean "to demand; to claim by right and authority; to exact; to demand as appropriate; to need, or call for." To "need" is given as a synonym. The word "promote" is defined to mean "to contribute to the growth, enlargement, or prosperity of; to forward; encourage; advance." One of its synonyms is to "help." (Webster's New International Dictionary, latest edition, Merriam Service, p. 1812.) Roget in his International Thesaurus of Words and Phrases, at pages 258 and 300, gives one use of the word "require" as in the sense of "need, want, or have occasion for," and the word "promote" in the sense of "aid, assistance, help, or advancement." With these different shades of meaning applied to those words it is at once difficult if not impossible for this court to determine as a matter of law on the face of the *de novo* rule that any alleged difference in their meaning could have any practical effect in the administration thereof. It would seem to be true that if the public convenience and advantage would be promoted by the establishment of a *de novo* branch such public convenience and advantage would require its establishment. Conversely, if the public convenience and advantage would require the establishment of a *de novo* branch its establishment would promote the public convenience and advantage. Whether the respondent in the application of the *de novo* rule has overstepped his statutory duty or authority will be referred to later in the consideration of the evidence.

When the rule on the face thereof is thus construed as in harmony with section 9 of the bank act it is but a declaration of policy on the part of the superintendent of banks. It is set up for the guidance of his own department in the orderly and efficient discharge of the duties of his office and is also a notification to banking corporations under his jurisdiction to the effect that if and when they desire a branch bank outside of the city of the head office a *prima facie* showing of the promotion of public convenience and advantage will be deemed to have been made when it appears that by purchase, consolidation, or merger the applying bank has acquired the control of an existing bank at the location of the proposed branch in such outside city, and that when the applying bank proposes to establish a *de novo* branch in such outside city Dec. 1926.] BANK OF ITALY v. JOHNSON. 23

the fact that it is to be a *de novo* branch will in itself constitute some showing that public convenience and advantage will not be promoted by the establishment of the new branch and will cast upon the applicant the burden of showing that an exception to the general rule should be made—the final ruling of the superintendent of banks to be subject at all times and in every case to the statutory power and duty of the superintendent of banks to deny the application unless he shall first ascertain that the public convenience and advantage will be promoted by the opening of the new branch. Such an announced policy we consider within the power of the superintendent of banks as a rule or guiding consideration of his department, and as a notice to applicants as to the showing necessary to be made, and as such is a valid regulation of the state banking department.

[16] Having in mind the foregoing determinations as to the powers and duties of the superintendent of banks and as to the proper construction of the *de novo* rule, and assuming that the original petition otherwise stated a cause of action to compel the respondent to act or to act in a particular manner, we are confronted with certain deficiencies in the said petition which render it vulnerable as against the general demurrer. For instance, it is not alleged therein that the capital and surplus of the petitioner were at the time of making said applications equal to or in excess of the amount required by section 9 of the Bank Act (Stats. 1909, p. 88), for the opening of said branches or that such facts were known to the respondent. It was not alleged that the petitioner had paid or tendered for payment the fees required by said section 9 (Stats. 1917, p. 602). It was not alleged that the petitioner had presented all of the essential facts to the respondent upon which he might properly exercise his discretion (*Sleeper v. Board of Supervisors*, 60 Cal. App. 744 [214 Pac. 292]). It was not alleged that the respondent was in possession of the facts of his own knowledge from which the only reasonable conclusion could be drawn that the public convenience and advantage would be promoted by the granting of said applications. These omitted allegations, or the substance thereof, were essential to state a cause of action against the respondent. [17] In advance of a 24 BANK OF ITALY v. JOHNSON. [200 Cal.

ruling on the demurrer the commissioner was appointed and the parties proceeded to produce evidence before him. The petitioner appears to have introduced its evidence on the theory that all matters essential to state a cause of action were in issue and the respondent introduced evidence to meet the petitioner's showing thereon. The petitioner, in the amendments to the petition which this court permitted to be filed, supplied the omitted allegations essential to state a cause of action. The court was prompted to grant leave to file said amendments not on the theory that the subject matter thereof had been proved in its entirety, for the evidence had not then been examined at length, but rather that the case might be determined on its merits. Under the peculiar circumstances here presented the respondent is nevertheless entitled to have a ruling on his demurrer. In the exercise of our discretion we will consider the demurrer as interposed to the petition as amended. With the amendments the petition states a cause of action and the demurrer is overruled.

[18] In his answer the respondent denied the material allegations of the petition which are in controversy and under the practice the allegations of the amendments filed to conform to the proof are deemed denied (McDougald v. Argonaut Land Co., 117 Cal. 87 [48 Pac. 1021]; Glougie v. Glougie, 174 Cal. 126 [162 Pac. 118]). He then affirmatively alleged that, since the adoption of the bank act in 1909, 109 permits for branch banks have been issued to the petitioner by the state banking department. From the tabulation presented it appears that of this number thirty-four have been issued since January 1, 1923. He set forth at length the situation as to the business conditions and banking facilities existing at the time the applications here in suit were made and in the localities where it was sought to establish said de novo branches; that he had made a personal examination of the situation on the ground before he denied said applications and that as a result of said examination and investigation and from his personal knowledge of the existing conditions he had determined that public convenience and advantage would not be promoted by the opening of said branches, and that he denied said applications for that reason; that the conditions as they existed at the time of the exercise by him of his dis- Dec. 1926.] BANK OF ITALY v. JOHNSON. 25

cretion in so ascertaining and at all times since said action was taken would not warrant the opening of said branches; that he has adhered to the *de novo* rule only in the sense that he had made use of the same as a guide or policy and not as a controlling factor in the exercise of his discretion and that he has never permitted it to limit, modify, or interfere with the exercise by him of his statutory discretion; that in the exercise of said power and in the discharge of his duties under the bank act and under the *de novo* rule he has considered each application for permission to open a branch bank on its own merits and has treated applications from all banks seeking such permits with like consideration; that the reason why the petitioner has not applied for more permits for *de novo* branches outside the city of its head office and particularly in Los Angeles is not alleged in the petition, but that the true reason is that the Federal Reserve Board has refused its permission to open such *de novo* branches, and if it were not for that fact the petitioner would have applied to him for numerous other branches *de novo* in Los Angeles and elsewhere, and in this connection alleges that on December 13, 1922, a permit was issued by his predecessor in office to the petitioner to open a *de novo* branch office at Yuba City, but that such branch has never been opened for the reason that the Federal Reserve Board denied petitioner's application therefor; that on July 13, 1923, the respondent issued to petitioner his written authority to open a *de novo* branch at Santa Maria and that said branch has never been opened because the Federal Reserve Board denied its permission; that on March 2, 1923, he granted petitioner his permission to open a *de novo* branch at Sacramento and that the Federal Reserve Board likewise denied its permission for that branch; that he granted permission to open a branch bank by purchase or merger with a local bank at Kingsburg, but that the Federal Reserve Board denied its permission to open said branch.

The respondent then set forth at length the history of the *de novo* rule and its general approval by the California League of Independent Bankers and by the unanimous action of the California Bankers Association in convention assembled; also the reason from the viewpoint of the respondent for the existence of the *de novo* rule and the rea- 26 BANK OF ITALY v. JOHNSON. [200 Cal.

sons why the said rule should be deemed a wise and salutary policy as affecting business and economic conditions in the state at large and why the continued adherence to the same should not be disturbed.

With the issues thus framed and presented we are brought to a consideration of the evidence. It is unnecessary, and indeed it would be futile, to attempt to state the same in detail within the confines of this opinion. With the latitude accorded the parties before the commissioner any and all evidence having any real or probable pertinency to the issues involved seems to have been elicited. We will, therefore, of necessity, set forth only portions of the evidence and be content with a reference to the remainder and then announce our findings and conclusions on the material portions thereof.

In proof of the allegation that the respondent had denied the applications here in suit solely because of the existence of the *de novo* rule the petitioner introduced in evidence a letter from respondent dated March 10, 1925, which was in response to the petitioner's application for the opening of the branch on South Flower Street. In this letter the respondent stated in part: "I regret very much the necessity of denying this application. This denial is based solely upon the ground that the location of the proposed branch office is outside of the limits of the city in which is located the principal place of business of the applying bank. As perhaps you may know, I have announced and agreed to certain rules regarding the granting of branch offices, one of which is that no *de novo* permissions for branch offices shall be granted for a location outside of the city in which the principal place of business of the applying bank is located. There is no application which has come to me to which I would rather give my sympathetic and affirmative consideration than this one of yours, but unfortunately I consider that I am bound in the exercise of my discretion by the rule above referred to." This letter was addressed to the petitioner and was signed by the respondent in his official capacity. The respondent testified that said letter did not set forth the true reason for the denial of the application; that said application was denied after his personal survey and inspection of the local conditions and an ascertainment by him that the public convenience and advantage would Dec. 1926.] BANK OF ITALY v. JOHNSON. 27

not be promoted by the granting thereof; that said letter was drafted by a subordinate in his office after a conference with him as to what action should be taken on the application, and that he did not instruct his subordinate how to word the letter; that said letter was signed by him as a matter of office routine and that he did not recall that the letter he signed was so worded. But it does not appear that he was laboring under any disability and the responsibility was his. The considerations urged by him in disparagement of the import of the language of the letter are not appealing. He must be held to have meant what the letter stated, as those dealing with him as a public officer had a right to assume that the language was authoritative.

In his letter to the petitioner of date March 20, 1925, which was in response to petitioner's application to remove its International Branch from its then location to No. 214 North Main Street and to establish the new and additional branch at North Spring Street and Sunset Boulevard, the respondent stated in part: "We note your application for permission to move your International Branch in the City of Los Angeles to the premises commonly known as No. 214 North Main Street. Permission is hereby given to make this transfer and our license for the new address will be issued as soon as the date of opening at the new location has been fixed. We also note your application for permission to establish a branch 'de novo' to be located at the Northwest Corner of North Spring street and Sunset Boulevard in the city of Los Angeles. . . . I regret that it is not possible for me to grant this application under the conditions which govern the exercise of my discretion in the matter of establishing branch offices. You are familiar with the ruling of this department issued March 8, 1923, affecting the granting of permission for the establishment of branch offices in localities outside the city wherein is located the head office of the applying bank. While I appreciate the needs of your business as you see them, there are other banks in Los Angeles situated about as you are in this Civic Center removal. I am unable to believe that the public convenience and advantage 'requires' at least three new branch offices in the City of Los Angeles because of the changes incident to the creation of this new Civic Center. 28 BANK OF ITALY v. JOHNSON. [200 Cal.

... While I appreciate your own point of view in this matter, I cannot believe that you are suffering any injustice in not receiving permission to establish *de novo* an additional branch office in the City of Los Angeles in consideration of being obliged to move your present International Branch." This letter was likewise signed by the respondent in his official capacity. He testified that it was also drafted by a subordinate in his office and was signed under like circumstances as the letter of March 10th and after an ascertainment by him that the public convenience and advantage would not be promoted by the granting of the application. Our conclusion with respect to the authenticity of this letter is the same as announced concerning the other. In each case the reason assigned for the denial was unauthorized. The respondent misconceived the effect of the *de novo* rule as *preventing* favorable consideration of said applications. His discretion under the statute could not thus be circumscribed. Under the law he had the power to grant the applications notwithstanding the *de novo* rule. Even under the language of the rule itself he could have granted them provided he ascertained that the public convenience and advantage would be promoted thereby.

The position taken by the respondent as evidenced by those letters amounted to a failure or refusal to act and exercise his discretion, as the law required. Said letters when considered alone and without reference to any other evidence would justify the issuance of the peremptory writ to compel the respondent to act in accordance with his statutory powers, but the petitioner is not seeking the issuance of the writ to compel the respondent to act but seeks the issuance thereof to compel him to grant said applications.

[19] We are not at liberty to accord to the language of said letters of denial the determinative importance contended for by petitioner. The reasons assigned for the denial of said applications did not preclude the respondent from setting up in this proceeding and relying upon any and all legal reasons for denying the same. The leading case in this state on this subject is *Ward v. Flood*, 48 Cal. 36 [17 Am. Rep. 405]. In that case the mother of a negro Dec. 1926.] BANK OF ITALY v. JOHNSON. 29

girl sought in a *mandamus* proceeding to compel the principal of the Broadway Grammar School in San Francisco to receive the girl as a pupil in said school. The petitioner alleged that the principal had refused to admit the girl to the school, "assigning as the only reason for such refusal the fact that she was a colored person." In his answer the principal set up another defense, namely, that the lowest grade in his school was the sixth grade, and that the girl had not received sufficient instruction to enable her to enter that grade. The petitioner made a motion for the issuance of the peremptory writ notwithstanding the matters alleged in the answer. The writ was denied, and as to the right of a public officer to set up in such a proceeding any lawful reason in opposition to the issuance of the writ the court said: "There is no doubt that if a party, upon tender or demand made, or other proceeding *in pais*, had put his refusal upon some particular omission or defect in the proceedings of his adversary, he will not afterwards be permitted, in support of such refusal, to allege a new or additional defect or insufficiency in these proceedings, especially if such defect or insufficiency be of such character as that it might have been cured if it had been pointed out or relied upon at the time. This is the ordinary and general rule, and it proceeds upon the idea that having specially designated one or more supposed insufficiencies the party thereby waives and abandons all others. But it is obvious that this rule can have no just application to the case now under consideration. If the law, under the circumstances actually appearing in the record before us, forbade the respondent, as the principal of the school, to admit the petitioner as a pupil therein, the circumstances that the respondent put his refusal on an untenable ground ought not in this proceeding to preclude an examination into the very right of the case. The claim of the petitioner to be admitted, and the corresponding duty of the defendant to admit her as a pupil, are governed by law; and if it appear, and it does unquestionably appear, upon the record before us, that she did not possess the requirements, in point of learning, sufficient to entitle her, whatever her color, to be admitted to any class in the school, even the lowest, then the respondent must be considered to have correctly 30 BANK OF ITALY v. JOHNSON. [200 Cal.

refused to have entertained her application for admission, and the legal sufficiency of the particular reason assigned by him for such refusal becomes wholly immaterial." (See, also, *Berger v. Justice*, 4 Cal. App. 532 [88 Pac. 591].) The petitioner seeks to avoid the applicability of the case of *Ward v. Flood*, supra, on the ground that the allegations of the answer therein were admitted. We are unable to discover any difference in principle between that case and the case at bar. The respondent herein alleged in his answer that his denial of said applications was based also on the ground that he had ascertained that the public convenience and advantage would not be promoted by the granting thereof. In his testimony he stated and reiterated that such was the fact and gave his reasons therefor and in the many days of his examination at the hands of counsel for petitioner his testimony was not seriously discredited. In one of the amendments to the petition it is alleged that the respondent in denying said applications "found and determined that public convenience and advantage would be promoted by the opening of said branches." There is no evidence in the record to support said allegation and the same is found to be untrue. The contrary under the evidence is found to be true, namely, that the respondent has never at any time found that public convenience and advantage would be promoted by the opening of said branches. For the foregoing reasons the claim of petitioner that because respondent's letters predicated his denial upon the existence of the *de novo* rule all other questions must be deemed resolved in its favor cannot be sustained.

[20] There is another reason why said letters of the respondent should not be held determinative of the rights of the parties herein. It is this: That the petitioner by its pleading and proof has thrown the case wide open on the question of whether as a matter of law on the face of the record and regardless of the *de novo* rule the respondent was compelled to find that the public convenience and advantage would be promoted by the opening of said branches; or, to put it another way, whether the showing is sufficient to authorize the court to find and conclude as matter of law that the respondent could have drawn but one conclusion from the facts before him, namely, the conclusion Dec. 1926.] BANK OF ITALY v. JOHNSON. 31

that the public convenience and advantage would be promoted by the granting of said applications. The law bearing on the solution of the problem thus presented is well settled. [21] It is the general rule that the writ of *mandamus* may not be employed to compel a public officer possessing discretionary power to act in a particular way. The court in such a proceeding may compel him to act, but it may not substitute its discretion for the discretion vested in such officer. This general rule is well stated with supporting authority in 16 Cal. Jur., at page 809, as follows: "It is a familiar rule governing the issuance of the writ of mandate that an officer in whom public duties are confided by law is not subject to the control of the courts in the exercise of the judgment and discretion which the law reposes in him as a part of his official functions. *Mandamus* may not compel the exercise of such discretion in any particular manner; it may only direct that the officer act, and must leave the matter as to what action he will take to his determination." (See, also, 38 C. J. 594.) An important exception to the foregoing general rule is that if the facts as admitted or proved be susceptible of but one construction or conclusion the right to the writ becomes a matter of law and the officer may be compelled to act in accordance with the facts as admitted or established (*Dufton v. Daniels*, 190 Cal. 577, and cases cited on page 581 [213 Pac. 949]). Cases further illustrating the exception to the general rule are *Inglin v. Hoppin*, 156 Cal. 483 [105 Pac. 582], *Hammel v. Neylan*, 31 Cal. App. 21 [159 Pac. 618], and *Walker v. Kingsbury*, 36 Cal. App. 617 [173 Pac. 95]. That the exception to the general rule is well established can admit of no doubt, but where the facts are not admitted and are controverted and are susceptible of more than one construction or conclusion and are susceptible of the conclusion adverse to the claimed right the writ should be denied. We are brought, then, to this question: Are the facts contained in the record before us susceptible of but one reasonable construction or conclusion, namely, that the public interest and advantage would be promoted by the opening of said branch banks? In answering this question we may not permit ourselves to be governed by the preponderance of evidence rule such as 32 BANK OF ITALY v. JOHNSON. [200 Cal.

governs a trial court or jury in an ordinary civil action. If that rule were to be applied we would be called upon to find and decide whether the petitioner had proved by a preponderance of evidence that public convenience and advantage would be promoted by the opening of said branches. This we may not do. [22] When the court is called upon, as in this case, to determine the character and sufficiency of the evidence to justify the writ as against the respondent we are governed by the rule that if there be any substantial evidence in the record which would have supported a conclusion on the part of the respondent that public convenience and advantage would not be promoted by the opening of such branches the writ must be denied. The rule which applies here is analogous to the rule that if there be any substantial evidence to support the finding of a trial court on an issue of fact, such finding may not be disturbed even though the court on appeal might consider that the evidence preponderated the other way. Applying, then, the rule which must govern in this case we find evidence at great length on both sides of that question. On the one hand, the petitioner has presented volumes of evidence by witnesses examined orally, and by maps, plats, surveys, records, and charts to prove that public convenience and advantage would be promoted by the opening of said branches. On the other hand the respondent has presented evidence to prove that public convenience and advantage would not be promoted thereby.

From an examination of the record and giving due credit to the material evidence therein presented it must be said that there is evidence of a very substantial character to support the conclusion that the public convenience and advantage would not be promoted by the opening of said branches. It may also be said that there is very substantial evidence to support the contrary conclusion. But when once we determine from the evidence presented that the conclusion could have been either for or against the petitioner's applications the inquiry is at an end. To hold otherwise would be to substitute the discretion of the court for the discretion of the superintendent of banks under the statute and to transfer from the duly constituted officer of the state to the court the power and the resultant duty of supervising to that extent the state banking de- Dec. 1926.] BANK OF ITALY v. JOHNSON. 33

partment. It is conceivable that in connection with every application facts of a substantial character might appear in support of one conclusion or the other. The court might thus be called upon to ascertain the facts and to draw its own conclusions therefrom in the case of every application to the superintendent of banks and his action thereon. It would be manifestly improper for the court, under the law, to undertake that task.

The many cases cited and relied on by petitioner, among which are *Riley v. Chambers*, 181 Cal. 589 [8 A. L. R. 418, 185 Pac. 855], *Tulare Water Co. v. State Water Com.*, 187 Cal. 533 [202 Pac. 874], *Tarpey v. McClure*, 190 Cal. 593 [213 Pac. 983], are cases wherein a public officer or board was compelled to act in a particular way by reason of the fact that he or it had no discretion in the premises or had improperly assumed discretion or having discretion the facts entitling the aggrieved party to the relief sought either as admitted or proved were solely susceptible of the construction or conclusion that as matter of law the relief sought should be granted. This is not such a case and the authorities relied upon are inapplicable.

The petitioner concedes that the *de novo* rule, which the respondent in a sense inherited from his predecessor and thereafter adhered to, was not designed to discriminate against it, but claims that the respondent acted arbitrarily in connection with said applications and in the enforcement of said rule which by its terms is alleged to be discriminatory. As to the disability or restriction which the respondent assumed himself to be laboring under by reason of the existence of the *de novo* rule, as expressed in his written denials, the petitioner's charge is sustained, but as the rule is a valid rule the action of the respondent thereunder becomes immaterial if it now appear that there were valid reasons for his denial of said applications. Notwithstanding the fact that we hold the reasons assigned for the denial of said applications in the respondent's letters of denial to be untenable, still we are met by the determinative consideration that by pleading and proof, regardless of the *de novo* rule and regardless of the said denials, the record in this proceeding presents substantial evidence sufficient to have supported the denial of said applications on legal grounds.

200 Cal.—3 34 BANK OF ITALY v. JOHNSON. [200 Cal.

[23] In the recent case of *Doble Steam Motors Corp. v. Daugherty*, 195 Cal. 158 [232 Pac. 140], this court approved another guiding principle to be applied to a case where it is sought, in a court proceeding, to interfere with discretionary power of a public board or officer. That was an application for a writ of mandate to compel the commissioner of corporations of this state, another state-wide officer possessing broad powers and duties of a discretionary nature, to issue his permit to the petitioner therein authorizing the latter to issue and deliver certain shares of its capital stock to certain individuals. It was decided that the facts presented were sufficient to support a denial of the application. In the course of the opinion the court said: "In the case of *Union Transp. Co. v. Bassett*, 118 Cal. 604 [50 Pac. 754], which was a proceeding in equity brought to enjoin the board of harbor commissioners from putting into effect an order of said board with respect to certain docking facilities, this court held that when subordinate boards or commissioners were by statute invested with discretion with respect to the exercise of their powers, courts would not interfere with such discretion in the absence of grave reasons tending to show that fraud, corruption, improper motives or influences, plain disregard of duty, gross abuse of power, or violation of law had entered into or characterized the determination of such body; and that in the absence of such showing of an abuse of discretion the determination of such board or commission would not be interfered with or overthrown." There is no showing herein, either by pleading or proof, of fraud, corruption, improper motives, or influences on the part of the respondent. If it be assumed that in assigning untenable reasons for the denial of said applications the respondent was guilty of "plain disregard of duty" and consequent violation of the statute by refusing to exercise his discretion as required, we are brought back to the proposition that what the petitioner desires herein is not the issuance of a writ to compel the respondent to act but to compel him to act favorably on said applications. Here, again, it must be said that the untenable reasons assigned for denial became and are immaterial in the state of the record. Dec. 1926.] BANK OF ITALY v. JOHNSON. 35

[24] On October 8, 1923, the Federal Reserve Board received a communication from some of the banks of this state concerning the action of the respondent in passing upon certain applications for branch banks, in which communication the respondent was requested to set forth his position with reference to the matters contained in said communication. In reply the respondent, over his signature, in his official capacity, and of date October 30, 1923, submitted a communication to the Federal Reserve Board, in which he stated that in his opinion branch banking in California had been such as to justify its continuance in this state, and that whatever might be said as to branch banking generally it is and has been a success in California. He then referred to the fact that conferences had been held with reference to proposed legislation designed to curtail, if not to prohibit, further branch banking in this state, and his determination to adhere to the de novo rule as a guiding consideration in his department within his statutory powers and duties. Continuing he said in part: "So far as I am aware, and judging from the reports of the Washington hearing that have come to me, the only instance where the propriety of a branch charter granted by me has been seriously questioned is that granted to the Bank of Italy for a branch de novo at Santa Maria. The Santa Maria situation had been an acute one for a considerable time, far antedating my incumbency as Superintendent of Banks. No profit can come from my entering into a discussion here of the merits of the Santa Maria situation. I accept the responsibility for the decision and wish to say that it was my own independent decision; that I knew at the time a former Superintendent of Banks had refused permission and I was well aware of the fact that there would be considerable criticism and a great deal of misunderstanding of my motives in the event that I did grant permission to the Bank of Italy to enter Santa Maria de novo. . . . The decision was made solely on the grounds of public convenience and necessity and I wish to say here that nothing has since been presented to cause me to change the opinion that I then formed that the people of Santa Maria were entitled to additional banking facilities. I do not intend to enter into a defense of my position in this matter any further than this and to state 36 BANK OF ITALY v. JOHNSON. [200 Cal.

that so far as the conference agreement with reference to branch banking is concerned, the decision in the Santa Maria case was made with that agreement entirely before my mind and that the decision was made, not in violation of that agreement, but rather as coming within the exception laid down in that agreement which had been very carefully placed therein at the suggestion of my attorney at the time the agreement was entered into. He pointed out the fact that to permit the agreement to be made hard and fast so that no banks *de novo* should be granted to branch banks would be to abdicate the authority granted me in the Bank Act and would be in violation of my oath to accept the duties and responsibilities of that Act, i. e., to refuse to determine for myself in obedience to the mandate of that Act in each and every instance where application is made, whether 'the public convenience and advantage would be promoted' by the granting of the charter to the applicant. More than that, it was then pointed out and the logic apparently appealed to all the conferees that discretion should reside in the Superintendent to deal with those instances where through failure to keep pace with the demands of the community the local banks had failed to meet the requirements of local service. Instead of incorporating the language of the statute into the exception, the language was changed from the 'public convenience and advantage be promoted thereby' to 'public convenience and advantage require it'; in other words the shade of difference runs from the rather mild word 'promoted' to the somewhat positive word 'require,' and in my finding after a personal investigation of conditions at Santa Maria I so found and have advised the Bank of Italy that I would give them permission to enter the town of Santa Maria upon the ground that I found the conditions to come within the exception laid down in this limitation, to-wit: That the public convenience and advantage of Santa Maria require further banking facilities." The foregoing communication to the Federal Reserve Board, its authenticity and the foundation for its introduction in evidence, formed the subject of much controversy between counsel. It is sufficient to say that it is deemed properly in evidence. Dec. 1926.] BANK OF ITALY v. JOHNSON. 37

Respondent testified that his attorney drafted the said communication, that it was so prepared in the nature of a brief, and that although the attorney seemed to have attempted therein to draw some "fine-haired" distinction between the meaning of the words "require" and "promote," he was unable to draw the same or any differentiation in their meaning and that in the practical application of the rule there was, to his mind, no distinction between the two words. Here again the respondent must be held to have meant what he said, regardless of who drafted the letter. Counsel for petitioner stresses at length the alleged significance to be attached to the phraseology employed by the respondent in said communication seeking thereby to demonstrate that in the practical application of the rule the respondent has given the word "require" a more restrictive meaning than the word "promote." There is merit in the petitioner's criticism of the attempt thus, in the face of the statute, to draw any distinction between the meaning of the words. But when the words are properly given no difference in meaning, the said communication indicates clearly that in the application of the *de novo* rule the respondent was duly cognizant of his statutory powers and duties under his oath of office.

The petitioner charges that the California League of Independent Bankers, the members of which were apprehensive of their security and of further invasion of their territory by branches of metropolitan banks, forced the respondent to adhere to the *de novo* rule and that it was only after the respondent's agreement to continue to adhere to it that the advocacy and support of legislation pending in the legislature of 1923 and designed practically to prohibit all branch banking was withdrawn by the independent bankers. The record supports the conclusion that the insistence of the independent bankers for legislation on the subject and the withdrawal of their support of pending measures were considerations in the mind of respondent in his decision to continue the rule. But we discover nothing that took place reflecting in any derogatory sense upon the action of the respondent or of the independent bankers in the premises, nor do we perceive how the validity of the rule could be affected by these questions of legislative and administrative policy which contributed to the decision to adhere to it. 38 BANK OF ITALY v. JOHNSON. [200 Cal.

[25] It is insisted by the respondent that to issue the writ as sought would in any event be a vain and useless thing, for the reason that the Federal Reserve Board has not granted its permission to the petitioner to open branch banks at the locations in question. We think the contention without merit for two reasons. First, the Federal Reserve Board is an official body entirely independent of any state authority, and the respondent is not responsible to that board in the exercise of his statutory powers, although he might properly feel called upon to act in co-operation with that board consistently with his duties under state law; and, secondly, the Federal Reserve Board might adopt and enforce a rule to the effect that it would not grant branch bank permits until the state superintendent of banks had first granted his permission. Each application might thus be brought to a standstill at the outset. Without question the statutory powers and duties of the respondent should be exercised and discharged independently of any authority having no lawful jurisdiction over him.

Many additional points are discussed in the briefs, but we deem it unnecessary specifically to refer to them in view of what has been decided.

We therefore find and conclude in accordance with the foregoing: 1. That section 9 of the bank act constitutes a lawful regulation governing the establishment and maintenance of branch banks in this state. 2. That the discretion vested in the superintendent of banks by said section is a lawful delegation of authority to him to be exercised within the limitations expressed in the section itself and as otherwise provided by law as above indicated. 3. That the *de novo* rule on the face thereof is a lawful exercise of the powers of the superintendent of banks as a policy to be followed by him and as an indication to applicants for branch bank permits of the showing necessary to be made to entitle them to obtain affirmative action on their applications, but in no sense as restricting, modifying, or controlling his statutory discretion. 4. That the reasons assigned by the respondent for his denial of said applications in his communications of March 10 and 20, 1923, were insufficient but that such untenable reasons did not preclude him from setting up herein additional and valid reasons for such denial. 5. That substantial evidence to support the conclusion that public Dec. 1926.] LIPTAK v. INDUSTRIAL ACC. COM. 39

convenience and advantage would not be promoted by the opening of said branch banks appears in the record; assuming that said evidence be sufficient to support a conclusion the other way on that issue, nevertheless this court should not substitute its discretion for the discretion vested in the superintendent of banks. 6. That the respondent has at no time ascertained that the public convenience and advantage would be promoted by the opening of said branch banks and that the contention of the petitioner that the respondent was bound to ascertain such fact as matter of law on the face of the record is not sustained. 7. That taken as a whole the record does not present facts justifying the issuance of the writ as sought.

The peremptory writ is therefore denied and the proceeding is dismissed,

JOHN LIPTAK, Petitioner, v. INDUSTRIAL ACCIDENT COMMISSION OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA, Respondent.

[1] WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION ACT—LOSS OF REMAINING EYE—PERMANENT DISABILITY.—Where an employee has previously lost the sight of one of his eyes, the loss of his remaining eye by an industrial accident results in a condition contemplated by section 9 of the Workmen's Compensation Act requiring a permanent disability rating.

[2] Id.—STATUTORY CONSTRUCTION.—Where a provision of the Workmen's Compensation Act is susceptible of an interpretation either beneficial or detrimental to an injured employee, the court is called upon, under the provisions of section 69, to adopt the construction beneficial to such employee.

R. P. Wisecarver and Redman & Alexander, *Amici Curiae*.

THE COURT.—A rehearing was granted herein in order that the court might give further consideration to the matters presented by respective counsel upon application therefor. Upon resubmission of the cause the court is satisfied with the correctness of its opinion heretofore filed herein and hereby adopts the same and reaffirms the order directed to be made therein. Said opinion reads as follows:

"The petitioner seeks to review an award made by the respondent Industrial Accident Commission for the loss of petitioner's remaining eye. The only point involved in the proceeding is whether or not the respondent Commission erred in not awarding petitioner more than twenty-six and one-fourth per cent disability rating for the loss of his remaining eye on July 28, 1924, through an industrial accident. The other eye had been lost many years previously through a nonindustrial accident. It is contended by the petitioner that under the Workmen's Compensation, Insurance and Safety Act (Stats. 1917, Ch. 586, p. 831) he should have been given a total permanent disability rating.

"We quote the pertinent provisions of the Act: 'Sec. 9, (b) (2) (9): The following permanent disabilities shall be conclusively presumed to be total in character: Loss of both eyes or the sight thereof; loss of both hands or the use thereof; an injury resulting in a practically total paralysis; an injury to the brain resulting in incurable imbecility or insanity. In all other cases, permanent total disability shall be determined in accordance with the fact.

"'(10) The percentage of permanent disability caused by any injury shall be so computed as to cover the permanent Dec. 1926.] LIPTAK v. INDUSTRIAL ACC. COM. 41

disability caused by that particular injury without reference to any injury previously suffered or any permanent disability caused thereby.

"Sec. 11, par. f: 'The fact that any employee has suffered a previous disability, or receives compensation therefor, shall not preclude him from compensation for a later injury, or his dependents from compensation for death resulting therefrom, but in determining compensation for the later injury, or death resulting therefrom, his average annual earnings shall be fixed at such sum as will reasonably represent his annual capacity at the time of the later injury.'

"Sec. 69, par. a: 'Whenever this act, or any part or section thereof, is interpreted by a court, it shall be liberally construed by such court with the purpose of extending the benefits of the act for the protection of persons injured in the course of their employment.'

[1] "It is contended by petitioner that 'The provisions of Section 9, above quoted, expressly fix the loss of the sight of both eyes as a permanent disability. If the sight of one eye has already been lost, then an accident causing the loss of the remaining eye results in the loss of the sight of both eyes, that is, total blindness, the condition contemplated by Subdivision 9 as requiring a permanent disability rating.'

"The respondent Commission concedes that the above quoted provisions of the Workmen's Compensation Act 'are possibly susceptible of different constructions.' To justify the award, however, it sets forth a brief history of the legislation, stating, in effect, that two reasons prompted the enactment of subdivision 10 of Sec. 9 (b) (2), above quoted, namely: (1) Public policy—it was thought that serious discrimination by employers against employees having but one eye might result if a heavy liability were imposed upon the employer in whose service the remaining eye was lost; and (2) The allaying of uncertainty as to whether or not the appellate courts of the state would uphold its awards under the law as it stood before the enactment of said subd. 10 of Sec. 9 (b) (2). It is then concluded by the respondent Commission that 'In view of the probability that the California Workmen's Compensation Act as enacted in 1913 would have been interpreted to allow a one hundred per cent disability for loss of a second eye, it would seem that the adoption of subd. 10 of Sec. 9 (b) (2) can be explained 42 LIPTAK V. INDUSTRIAL ACC. COM. [200 Cal.

only upon the theory that the legislature desired to avoid this conclusion.'

"A brief was also filed by the State Compensation Insurance Fund which states, in substance, that the only issue is the proper construction to be given Sec. 9 (b) (2) (10) of the Workmen's Compensation Act and that in construing this section due consideration should be accorded to the interpretation given it by the Industrial Accident Commission for the past ten years, to the history of the amendment, its purposes, and to public policy.

"In reply to these two briefs the petitioner asserts that 'the provisions of Section 9 (b) (2) (10) admit of the construction for which the petitioner here contends; that it is the plain duty of the court under the further provisions of Section 69 of the Act to give petitioner the benefit of every doubt, if any exists in the mind of the court, in construing that Section so as to make it effective for his benefit.'

"It is plain to us from the ambiguous and uncertain language of subdivision 10 of Sec. 9 (b) (2) that is is, in a sense, susceptible of either of the constructions contended for and that it might, were it not for paragraph 'a' of Sec. 69, support either interpretation. The language of the subdivision is such that it may properly and reasonably be said to support the construction urged by petitioner, namely, that the percentage of permanent disability caused by an injury shall be computed without reference to any injury previously suffered or any permanent disability caused thereby, which, in the case of an employee having but one eye and losing it, would be a total permanent disability. [2] Where, as here, a provision of the Act is susceptible of an interpretation either beneficial or detrimental to an injured employee we are called upon, under the provisions of section 69, to adopt the construction beneficial to such employee.

"That the loss of a remaining eye, through an industrial accident, results in permanent total disability would seem to be suggested by the declarations of appellate courts in other jurisdictions. In *Branconnier v. Travelers' Ins. Co.*, 223 Mass. 273 [111 N. E. 792], the court declared: 'The total capacity of this employee was not so great as it would have been if he had had two sound eyes. His total capacity was thus only a part of that of the normal man. But that Dec. 1926.] LIPTAK v. INDUSTRIAL ACC. COM. 43

capacity, which was all he had, has been transferred into a total incapacity by reason of the injury.'

"It is stated in *In re J. & P. Coats*, 41 R. I. 289 [103 Atl. 833], that 'The resulting total and permanent loss of vision must be productive of the same disability, whether the injured person before the accident had one or two eyes. In the case of the man with one eye the employer is not by this interpretation made to give him compensation for the earlier loss of the other eye, as seems to be suggested, inasmuch as the compensation to be paid is based upon the presumably fair wage paid the employee for his earning capacity at the time of the injury, which totally deprived him of that capacity.'

"We quote from *Brooks v. Peerless Oil Co.*, 147 La. 383 [83 South. 663], the following: 'The rationale of these Employers' Liability Acts is that the employment in which the workman has been disabled owes him a living, and it stands to reason that the workman is as totally disabled from work by the loss of one eye as by the loss of two, if he had but one, and by the impairment of the sight as much as by the loss of it, if the impairment be to such a degree as to disable entirely from work. In speaking of the workman being only partially disabled by the loss of one eye, one arm, or one foot, the Employers' Liability Act has reference evidently to the normal man, having both eyes, arms or feet.'

"We find no merit in the contention of respondent Commission that the decisions of other jurisdictions are distinguishable and not controlling for the reason that no provision similar to our subdivision 10 of Sec. 9 (b) (2) was involved, for, as already indicated, this subdivision is ambiguous and open to possible conflicting interpretations and must, under section 69, be construed in favor of the injured employee.

"In view of the foregoing the award of the respondent Commission is annulled and the Industrial Accident Commission is hereby ordered and directed to make and enter an award of permanent total disability in favor of petitioner." 44 CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY COM. v. INDUS. ACC. COM. [200 Cal.

CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY COMMISSION, DEPARTMENT OF ENGINEERING, STATE OF CALIFORNIA, Petitioner, v. INDUSTRIAL ACCIDENT COMMISSION OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA and ROBERT SMITH, Respondents.

[1] PRISONERS—EMPLOYMENT ON HIGHWAYS—COMPENSATION FOR INJURIES.—A convict engaged in the performance of labor on the state highway, under the provisions of chapter 316 of the Laws of 1923, is an employee within the meaning of the constitution and the Workmen's Compensation Act.

[2] ID.—DEPRIVATION AND RESTORATION OF CIVIL RIGHTS—POWER OF LEGISLATURE.—The power to deprive a prisoner of his civil rights is one that resides in the legislature, and this power includes the corresponding power to restore them.

[3] ID.—CONVICT ROAD CAMP BILL—CONSTRUCTION OF.—The Convict Road Camp Bill (Stats. 1923, c. 316, p. 667), partially restores to convicts their civil rights and authorizes those who are afforded the privilege to enter into a contract of employment with the State Highway Commission, which entitles them to all the rights under the act, one of which is the benefits enjoyed by employees under the Workmen's Compensation Act.

[4] ID.—COMPENSATION—GIFTS—POWER OF LEGISLATURE—CONSTITUTIONAL LAW.—The legislature, having power to restore the suspended civil rights of a convict and to compensate him for the character of work provided by the Convicts Road Camp Bill, the sums provided for do not constitute a gift under section 34 of article IV of the constitution.

G. C. Faulkner and Milton L. Schmitt for Respondents.

THE COURT.—The following opinion prepared by Mr. Presiding Justice John F. Tyler of the district court of appeal, first district, division one, while sitting as a justice pro tempore of this court, is adopted as the opinion of the court:

"Certiorari to review an award of the Industrial Accident Commission. The facts are simple and without dispute. Robert Smith was convicted of the crime of burglary in the first degree. On March 10, 1922, he was sentenced to state prison for a term of from one to fifteen years. After serving the minimum sentence of one year the board of prison directors fixed his full sentence at five years. Shortly thereafter Smith made application and was granted permission to perform work on the public highways of the state under the direction of the State Highway Commission, he being eligible for this privilege. One of the benefits enjoyed by prisoners assigned to this character of work is a credit on the sentence to be served of two days for every one day of service at highway work. Shortly after his assignment to a prison camp, chapter 316 of the laws of 1923 became effective. This act provides, among other things, for the payment of compensation to a convict for work so performed by him, and Smith received the benefits conferred by the act. On March 17, 1924, while performing his duties as a road laborer he was struck by flying fragments from an accidental explosion of a blast, causing him various and serious bodily injuries, including injuries to both of his eyes. Smith was thereupon returned to the hospital at San Quentin for treatment. Upon his discharge from the hospital he remained within the prison until he was finally paroled on account of the severe injuries he had received. His credits materially reduced the term of his sentence which was completed on June 25, 1925, at which time he was finally discharged from custody. On August 25th, following, he filed an application with the Industrial Accident Commission for disability benefits by reason of his injuries. The state insurance fund was the insurance carrier and it was joined as a defendant in the proceeding. The Commission made an award in favor 46 CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY COM. v. INDUS. ACC. COM. [200 Cal.

of Smith. It provided for the payment to him forthwith of the sum of $791.52 as compensation for permanent disability, and beginning with March 10, 1926, the further weekly sum of $7.76 for a period of 138 weeks, and after the expiration of that time, the weekly sum of $4.79 for the remainder of his life. The award was made upon the theory that the relation of master and servant existed between California Highway Commission and the applicant by reason of the provisions of the act of 1923, providing for the payment by the Commission to convicts for services performed by them on the state highways. [1] The sole question, therefore, that is here presented is whether or not a convict engaged in the performance of labor on a state highway under the provisions of chapter 316 of the laws of 1923 is an employee within the meaning of the Constitution and the Workmen's Compensation Act. There is no provision either in the organic law or the statutes which directly includes or excludes him as such. The question, therefore, concerning what relationship exists between the state and an incarcerated convict so employed involves the proper construction to be given to the various laws relating to the subject. Section 673 of the Penal Code declares that a sentence of imprisonment in a state prison for a term less than life suspends all the civil rights of the prisoner so sentenced during his term of imprisonment. Section 1586 of the same code provides, in substance, that all convicts may be employed by authority of the prison directors under the charge of the wardens in performance of work for the state. Section 1588 charges the directors with the duty of requiring every able-bodied convict confined in a state prison to perform as many hours of faithful labor every day during the term of his imprisonment as shall be prescribed by the rules and regulations of the prison. Under this section, and before the passage of the indeterminate sentence law went into effect July 27, 1917, a convict who performed in a faithful manner the duties assigned to him was entitled as of right to fixed credit for good conduct. That plan was done away with by the legislature in adopting the plan of indeterminate sentence. (In re Lee, 177 Cal. 690, 695 [171 Pac. 958].) The board of prison directors thereafter, and solely as a prison regulation, adopted a plan by which, in the discretion of the board, deserving convicts were awarded credits. Dec. '26.] CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY COM. v. INDUS. ACC. COM. 47

(See *In re Mann*, 192 Cal. 165 [219 Pac. 71].) It is manifest that under these sections the relationship of master and servant growing out of employment does not exist by implication for the reason that a convict confined within the prison walls is deprived of civil rights which his sentence suspends. Work performed by him is compulsory on his part and for it he receives no compensation. The incapacity thus imposed upon felons resembles in some respects the ancient ban of *civiliter mortuus*. (*Lewis v. State*, 96 N. Y. 71 [48 Am. Rep. 607]; *Thompson v. Bronk*, 126 Mich. 455 [85 N. W. 1084].) Under the provisions of the act of June 16, 1913 (Stats. 1913, p. 1048), a comprehensive parole system has been adopted under which a prisoner undergoing a first term of imprisonment other than for life is entitled, as a matter of right, upon the expiration of one year of his sentence, to make application for parole. If parole be granted, a prisoner so paroled may contract for his employment, for by section 673 of the Penal Code, the board of prison directors may restore to such prisoner certain civil rights. The scope and extent of the civil rights so restored are to be determined by the board at the time the parole is granted. The question of what contractual rights a paroled prisoner may acquire under this act, however, is a purely academic one so far as this case is concerned, for the applicant had not been granted a parole thereunder at the time of his injury. A discussion of the status of a paroled prisoner may be found in California Law Review, volume 2, page 401, and also in volume 5 of the same periodical at page 81. We are not here directly concerned with this question. In the year 1923 the legislature enacted what is generally known as the Convicts Road Camp Bill (Stats. 1923, chap. 316, p. 667). This act, among other things, provides that the State Highway Commission may employ or cause to be employed on the highways of the state certain convicts confined in the state prisons, and that when so employed such convicts shall receive a specified compensation not exceeding seventy-five cents net per day for their labor. Provision is also made for authority of the prison directors to send the number of convicts to a prison camp as may be requisitioned by the Commission. Under these conditions it is respondents' claim in support of the award that this act entirely changes the status of convicts who may be assigned to work on the 48 CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY COM. v. INDUS. ACC. COM. [200 Cal.

highways, and creates a new class of paroled prisoners between whom and the state a relationship is created, one of the incidents of which is a liability under the Workmen's Compensation Act for injuries. Respondents seem to concede that while engaged in work within the prison walls, this claimed relationship does not and cannot arise, but they insist that there is logically and necessarily a real, definite and distinct difference between the status of a convict within and one without the prison walls performing work upon the highways under the provisions of the act in question; that as to the latter it was the intention of the legislature as evidenced by the use in the act of the words 'employ' and 'employment' to authorize the State Highway Commission to enter into a contract of employment with convicts released for such work. We are of a like opinion. It may be conceded that one serving a sentence of imprisonment in a state prison is, in contemplation of law, a prisoner therein, as well when at work outside, under surveillance of the prison guards, as when confined within its walls (Bradford v. Glenn, 188 Cal. 350 [205 Pac. 449]). [2] The power, however, to deprive a prisoner of his civil rights is one that resides in the legislature. The power to thus deprive a prisoner of such rights must include the corresponding power to restore them. This we think was the manifest intention and purpose of the Convicts Road Camp Bill. The legislation is in keeping with the modern idea that it is for the benefit of society to rehabilitate those possessing criminal instincts, and one of the means employed is to partially restore to them their civil rights to contract for their labor as an encouragement to that end. [3] The act so expressly indicates, for it provides by the very first section thereof that the 'state highway commission may employ or cause to be employed, convicts confined in the state prisons, etc.' In the same section it is provided that all convicts so employed shall receive the compensation provided for, and such compensation is referred to as earnings. The word 'employ' has a definite legal meaning and legal terms when used in a statute are to be construed according to the context and the approved usage of language unless a different sense is obviously intended. (Civ. Code, sec. 13; Fidelity & Casualty Co. v. Industrial Acc. Com., 191 Cal. 404 [43 A. L. R. 1304, 216 Pac. 578].) There is nothing contained in the statute Dec. '26.] CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY COM. v. INDUS. ACC. COM. 49

which indicates that a different meaning was intended. On the contrary, its manifest object was to authorize those who were afforded the privilege to enter into a contract of employment with the State Highway Commission to have restored to them the limited civil right which the reformative measure provides for. The statute as a whole should be liberally construed to carry out its beneficent purposes. (Western Ind. Co. v. Pillsbury, 172 Cal. 807 [159 Pac. 721].) It was in evidence and it is not disputed that it was optional with prisoners as to whether they would accept this labor or not. They were at liberty to refuse it and in some instances it had been refused. Having accepted it, however, the applicant was entitled to all the rights under the act, one of which must be held to be the benefits enjoyed by employees under the Workmen's Compensation Act. [4] The legislature having the power to restore the suspended civil rights of a convict and having the further power to compensate them for the character of the work in question, it follows that the sums provided for do not constitute a gift under section 31 of article IV of the Constitution, as suggested by petitioners.

"We conclude, therefore, that under the terms of the Convicts Road Camp Bill the legislature intended to restore to a convict assigned to work upon the public highways such limited civil rights as are necessary to create the relation of master and servant between him and the State Highway Commission, and this being so, he must be held to be an employee within the meaning of the Workmen's Compensation Act. It follows that the applicant is entitled to all the benefits of this act and the Industrial Accident Commission was correct in so concluding.

"For the reasons given the award is affirmed."

RICHARDS, J.—This is an appeal from a judgment of the superior court in and for the county of Los Angeles denying the plaintiffs an injunction. In their complaint praying for the relief the plaintiffs allege that they are residents of and owners of property within the corporate limits of a municipal corporation known as "The City of Venice" and situate within the county of Los Angeles; that the duly constituted municipal officers thereof have instituted and are about to carry forward certain public improvements therein under and by virtue of the Improvement Act of 1911 [Stats. 1911, p. 730], and the amendments thereto, which, if permitted to be consummated, will result in the assessment of the properties of said plaintiffs, and each of them, to pay the costs and expenses of said improvements. Said plaintiffs also sue in their capacity as members of the general public, contending that said proposed improvements are unlawful for the reasons hereinafter to be set forth. In support of their foregoing averments the plaintiffs aver in substance the following to be the facts of the case. During the years 1904–5 and for some years thereafter the Abbot Kinney Company, a corporation, was the owner and in possession of a tract of marsh-land lying along the coast line near the city of Ocean Park in the county of Los Angeles, which those in control of it conceived the idea of reclaiming and creating thereon a city to be known as "Venice of America," with a system of waterways and canals resembling those of the city of Venice, Italy. In accordance with this conception the corporation caused the lands to be reclaimed and laid out in lots, blocks, streets, and intercommunicating waterways converging into an artificial lagoon and connected with the adjacent ocean, all in conformity with the outlines of a map of the tract which the corporation caused to be prepared and filed for record with the county recorder of said county. 52 SCHULTZ v. CITY OF VENICE. [200 Cal.

The corporation also caused the banks of these waterways, or so-called canals, to be cemented and the strips of land adjacent thereto to be planted with trees, vines, and shrubbery and to be ornamented with structures of Italian types of architecture, and also caused archways and bridges to be built in harmonious designs and at such elevations as would not interfere with the use of these waterways for boating, canoeing, and other aquatic purposes and pleasures. The lagoon into which these waterways converged was also provided with structures suitable for such public pleasure purposes as swimming, diving, water sports, and festivities. The streets intersecting these canals were also laid out and so improved as to be adapted for residential purposes and the lands adjacent thereto were subdivided into residential lots and tracts, and when these designs and improvements were well under way were offered for sale upon a plan of advertising which emphasized the unique features of this particular dream city as the proposed "Venice of America," with the result that the lots and tracts within the same were largely sold to residential buyers who thereafter built and occupied residences thereon. The plaintiffs herein, or their predecessors, were among those who were thus induced to purchase and improve and reside upon the lots and tracts therein thus advertised and sold. With respect to the foregoing facts there appears to be no controversy between the parties hereto and they are fully set forth in the findings of the trial court. The plaintiffs further allege that by the foregoing acts and conduct of said corporation in the conception and carrying out of the plans and purpose of creating upon said tract the so-called "Venice of America" with its waterways, lagoon, and other artificial resemblances to the old world city, and by the adaptation thereof to those public purposes, sports, and pleasures which would constitute the natural and appropriate uses of such waterways and lagoon, and in the devotion of the same to such purposes through a series of years, and in the system of promotion and advertising by which the said corporation disposed of a large portion of the residential and other lots and tracts within the limits of said city, the said corporation had long prior to the year 1925 wrought a dedication of the areas covered by said waterways and lagoon and the banks and strips of land adjacent thereto to public purposes, and also Dec. 1926.] SCHULTZ v. CITY OF VENICE. 53

that the uninterrupted public use thereof during all of these intervening years had so consummated and effectuated such dedication thereof to such uses as to result in the setting apart and devotion of said waterways and their immediately adjacent lands to such public uses and purposes forever. The plaintiffs further allege that the said corporation by its aforesaid representations made in the course of the advertisement and sale of the residential and other lots and tracts within the area of said city, whereby the plaintiffs and the inhabitants generally within the same were induced to buy and build upon and occupy their several homes and properties therein, were such as to entitle the said plaintiffs representing themselves and all the other residents and property owners within said city to the full benefit of such dedication of said waterways and their immediately adjacent lands as delineated upon the recorded map of the same to such public purposes and to claim an estoppel of said corporation and of its successor or successors in interest from the assertion of any right to devote said dedicated areas to other than such specified purposes or to interfere with or destroy the utilization thereof for the purposes to which they had been fully dedicated and devoted during a long series of years, and the plaintiffs particularly allege that the defendants, by the proposed plan of improvement of said areas under the act of 1911 as contemplated and as in the course of being carried forward by them, will destroy the public uses to which said waterways and their said adjacent strips of land have thus been dedicated and devoted to the irreparable injury of the said plaintiffs and the public at large. Wherefore they sought the injunctive relief prayed for in their said complaint. The defendants, constituting the City of Venice, a municipal corporation, and also the officers and trustees and also the Abbot Kinney Company, a corporation, duly appeared and answered herein, their said answer and the amendments thereafter offered thereto embracing certain admissions and denials to be hereinafter considered. Thereupon the respective parties to the action entered into certain stipulations relating to the procedure in the course of the trial of the action and the presentation of certain of the evidence to be produced by the respective parties in the form of affidavits. The cause then came on for trial, pursuant to the procedure outlined in said stipulations before the court sitting without 54 SCHULTZ v. CITY OF VENICE. [200 Cal.

a jury; and having been thus tried and submitted the trial court in due time filed its findings of fact and conclusions of law, and upon the basis thereof caused its judgment to be entered in favor of the defendants, denying to the plaintiffs any injunctive relief. Thereafter a bill of exceptions was duly prepared, certified, and filed and this appeal by the plaintiffs taken.

[1] The primary question presented for our consideration upon this appeal relates to the sufficiency of the record herein to present the main question which the plaintiffs seek to have determined. The bill of exceptions presented herein, while it contains a considerable amount of the evidence presented at the trial in the form of affidavits in support or dispute of the issues embraced in the pleadings, does not contain any specification of the insufficiency of the evidence to sustain the findings of the trial court. Such specifications are expressly required by the provisions of section 648 of the Code of Civil Procedure relating to bills of exceptions, and it has been uniformly held that such provisions are mandatory and that in their absence the question of the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain the findings of the trial court cannot be considered by this court upon appeal from the judgment. (Beeson v. Schloss, 183 Cal. 618 [192 Pac. 292]; Mills v. Brady, 185 Cal. 317 [196 Pac. 776], and cases cited.)

[2] The appellants herein contend, however, that the foregoing rule of procedure has only application to those matters which are put in issue by the pleadings, and that as to the question of the dedication of the waterways with their adjacent lands and premises to which this action particularly relates, arising out of the acts and conduct of the defendant Abbot Kinney Company in connection with its conception and execution of its designs for the creation of the unique community to be known as "Venice of America," and also as to the consummation of such dedication to the particular public uses to which said waterways and their adjacent premises were devoted through the public use thereof during a long series of years, the averments of the plaintiffs' pleadings have not been sufficiently denied by the defendants' answer or the amendments thereto, and hence were not in issue so as to require any findings on the part of the trial court; and that this being so no specification of the insufficiency of the evidence to sustain those undenied and thus admitted Dec. 1926.] SCHULTZ v. CITY OF VENICE. 55

averments was required. When we examine the pleadings in the case in the light of this contention we are constrained to hold that there was, to say the least of it, some attempt on the part of the defendants to deny those averments of the plaintiffs' complaint which tendered the issue as to the original dedication of these waterways and their adjacent premises to the particularly alleged public uses, and also to deny the alleged consummation of such dedication to such uses through the public acceptance of the same. Whether these denials would have been deemed sufficient to have presented the particular issue if tested by demurrer to the defendants' answer or by motion for judgment upon the pleadings we do not deem it necessary to determine. When we look to the findings of the trial court for the purpose of ascertaining what issues in the case it deemed to be before it and hence to require findings, we discover that court did in fact make findings upon this particular issue; and this being so, we must conclude that the cause was tried before it upon the theory that such issue was sufficiently tendered by the pleadings and that the court was, therefore, required to make findings thereon. The findings of the trial court expressly negative the dedication of the said premises either by the acts and conduct of the defendant corporation with relation thereto, or by the subsequent user thereof by the public. In that connection the findings of the court are to the effect that the plans and purposes of said corporation with relation to the laying out, construction, opening, and sale of the said tract of land were such as to merely amount to a dedication of the canals and waterways thereon and of the lands immediately contiguous thereto to the public at large as public ways for all way purposes, and that the public use thereof continuously and for a long period, without objection or limitation on the part of said corporation, amounted to a public use thereof for all way purposes and not otherwise. The trial court further found that as to the plaintiffs herein their rights and interests in said waterways and canals were not other or different from those of the public at large. Based upon these findings of fact and upon the further finding that the said Abbot Kinney Company, having retained the title to lands upon which said waterways and canals were located, subject to the aforesaid public easement and use, had, by sufficient conveyance, transferred to 56 SCHULTZ v. CITY OF VENICE. [200 Cal.

the City of Venice, a municipal corporation, in the year 1912 its title in fee to said areas, and that the said City of Venice after maintaining said waterways and canals as such public ways for a number of years had finally determined that said public ways would be more useful to the public through their conversion into surface streets and hence had initiated and was proceeding with the improvement of the areas thereof as such under the Improvement Act of 1911, the trial court, as its conclusion of law, found that the plaintiffs were not entitled to the relief prayed for in their complaint. Considering these findings as a whole and in the light of the record before us, we are constrained to hold that they so far dispose of the questions sought to be litigated by the parties to this action as to have required specifications of insufficiency of the evidence to sustain them in order to enable us to consider and dispose of that question upon this appeal. The appellants herein present no other question nor do they in any manner assail the sufficiency of the proceedings had and taken under the act of 1911 for the public improvement of the premises in accordance with the provisions of said act and of the amendments thereto. It follows that the judgment of the trial court upholding such proceedings and denying said plaintiffs the relief sought from the operation and effect thereof was not erroneous and that the same should be and is hereby affirmed.

[1] ESTATES OF DECEASED PERSONS—WILLS—TESTAMENTARY CAPACITY—HALLUCINATIONS—DELUSIONS.—Proof of the existence of hallucinations or delusions is not alone sufficient to annul a will unless such hallucinations or delusions bear directly upon the testamentary act.

[2] Id.—WILL CONTEST—UNSOUNDNESS OF MIND.—In a will contest upon the ground of unsoundness of mind of the testator, the question to be determined is not what might have been the mental condition of the testator, but what in fact was his mental condition at the time he made the will.

[3] Id.—WILLS—SUBSCRIBING WITNESSES—PRESUMPTIONS—OPINIONS.—The law presumes that the subscribing witnesses to the execution of a will had their attention drawn to and noted the mental capacity of the testator; and the opinions of such witnesses are entitled to more weight than that of one who is merely passive.

[4] Id.—TESTAMENTARY CAPACITY—HARDENING OF ARTERIES.—It does not follow that testamentary capacity ceases with the approach of or even with the most advanced stages of arterial hardening; this condition or stage in life is but partial evidence to be considered in connection with other evidence in determining whether or not arteriosclerosis has shut off the blood supply to the brain to the extent that the mind is unable to correctly function.

[5] Id.—COMPETENCY—EVIDENCE.—In considering the question of a testator's competency, the issue does not rest upon the contestant's evidence alone, but the testimony of proponent's witnesses must be taken into consideration in weighing the sufficiency of the contestant's case; and evidence which standing by itself might be sufficient to sustain a verdict may in the light of all the facts be wholly inadequate, and that without invading the province of the jury as the judges of the weight and sufficiency of the evidence.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Superior Court of the City and County of San Francisco. Thomas F. Graham, Judge. Reversed.

The facts are stated in the opinion of the court.

John C. Quinlan and James F. Brennan for Respondent.

Theodore J. Savage for Appellant.

SEAWELL, J.—On August 29, 1922, Christopher McDonough made his last will and testament and died June 5, 1924, one year and nine months thereafter. At the time of his death he left surviving him his son, Daniel, the contestant herein, aged about forty-four years and a resident of Massachusetts. The other children of the testator, according to the testimony of Daniel, had died without issue prior to the death of the testator. By his will he devised his estate, which at the time his will was executed consisted of a sum of less than eight thousand dollars in bank, except the sum of one hundred dollars, to proponent, Elizabeth Joyce, the wife of Martin Joyce. The contestant by his action herein alleged two grounds of contest: First, undue influence, and, second, unsoundness of mind. A nonsuit was granted as to the first ground and the finding of the jury that the testator was of unsound mind at the time he executed the will was sustained by the trial court, and judgment was accordingly entered thereon annulling and revoking the probate of said will. The appeal is taken from the whole of said judgment.

There seems to be some uncertainty as to the exact age of testator at the time he made his will. It is probable that his age, as declared in the will to be seventy-eight years, was approximately correct.

The testator was a native of Ireland, unable to read or write, and by trade a street-paver. The date of his arrival in this country does not appear from the record, but it does appear that he was a resident of the state of Massachusetts in 1887. At that time his wife was living and he was the father of seven young children, contestant then being seven or eight years of age. It would seem that the home was destroyed by a cause not disclosed in the record, the parents Dec. 1926.] ESTATE OF McDONOUGH. 59

went apart, and the custody of the young children fell to the father. The testimony of contestant, who was then but seven or eight years of age, was to the effect that his father, in 1887, placed said children in the care of an institution conducted by the Roman Catholic Church. He never saw his mother thereafter and saw his father but once, for a short time in 1915, when the latter visited the son at his home in Massachusetts. The record is silent as to the date of the mother's death.

It seems that upon leaving Massachusetts, McDonough resided for a time at Salt Lake City and finally took up his residence in San Francisco in 1894, where he resided until the day of his death, a period of approximately thirty years. His early life was spent in the old world, where rigid economy was a rule of necessity and saving became a fixed habit, which he practiced during the entire earning period of his life.

It is contestant's contention that prior to going to live with the Joyce family the testator lived in a condition of extreme squalor, which alone was sufficient to create a serious doubt as to his sanity. Much stress is laid upon his method of living covering a period of about three years. The first insight given of his methods of living begins with the year 1901. In that year he became a roomer at a rooming-house conducted by Mrs. Anna McManus, where he remained until forced out by the fire and earthquake of 1906. Mrs. McManus re-established herself after the fire and the testator returned as a roomer. He remained at her house until 1915, at which time he made a visit to his son, who was residing in Massachusetts. After three months' absence in the east he returned to San Francisco and again took a room at the McManus home. He remained there until July, 1917, when, against his wish, he was compelled to seek another rooming place, as Mrs. McManus needed the room for her own purposes. He then went to live with Michael Moran in South San Francisco. It is claimed by several witnesses offered by proponent that the "shack," as the building was described, presented a revolting picture of squalor and filth. Paradoxical as it may appear, several of the witnesses who expressed a pronounced feeling of disgust at the wretched conditions that prevailed at the Moran place nevertheless sought the companionship of McDonough and were very frequent 60 ESTATE OF McDONOUGH. [200 Cal.
visitors at the home of filth. The principal witness to the unsanitary and filthy condition of the premises admitted that his visits often continued as long as two or three hours at a time. McDonough and Moran, according to the testimony offered by the proponent, lived in the state of wretchedness described by some of the witnesses for a period of about three years. McDonough, however, without apparently consulting his old associates, left the Moran place and established himself at the Joyce home. Giving full credit to the testimony of the witnesses as to the conditions existing at the Moran premises, it would seem that McDonough finally and fully awoke to a sense of realization of the degradation by which he was surrounded, as was evidenced by his resolve to enter a home where neatness and order prevailed, in which he might pass the remaining years of his life enjoying the comforts of a home and receiving the care and attention which only a woman's hands can administer. In quitting the Moran premises he certainly acted wisely. He had laid aside a sum sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to secure him against want.

Contestant produced witnesses who testified that testator was in the habit of picking up copper wire, mechanical bolts, nuts, broken pipes, and broken hairpins and safety-pins, tin cans, and cigar and cigarette stubs which he brought to his room. At times he complained of being dizzy and of seeing specks or spots in the air, and he also was heard to complain of pains in the back of his head and had been heard to say, "I wish I was dead." He had been known to fail to recognize an acquaintance upon meeting him on the street until such person made himself known. His eyes upon a few occasions appeared to be "starey" and sometimes he would "glare." It is said that at times he had worn copper wire about his wrist as a sort of talisman against aches and pains; that upon certain occasions he had fallen and had to be assisted to his home, and that he had fallen asleep while reclining outdoors and awakened after the rain had started to fall. Mental lapses, repetitions in conversation, loss of sense of location for the moment, and failure to appreciate the passing of time, as well as acts which may or may not be evidence of mental weakness, were testified to by witnesses called by the contestant. Thirty years of the testator's life were brought into review and the acts culled therefrom which it is claimed Dec. 1926.] ESTATE OF McDONOUGH. 61

show a want of testamentary capacity are wholly insufficient to sustain the judgment. The witnesses for contestant who testified as to the mental unsoundness of testator by virtue of the provisions of section 1870, subdivision 10, Code of Civil Procedure, which permits an intimate acquaintance to give an opinion of mental sanity of a person, the reason for the opinion being given, related certain acts and circumstances in support of their opinions which in point of time were somewhat remote from the exact time the will was executed. Much of the evidence amounts to nothing more than a conclusion and the reasons for the opinions given lack convincing force. Not one of contestant's witnesses was willing to say that testator was suffering from settled insanity. When put to the test, scarcely one was willing to say that he believed him to be "crazy" in the general sense of the term. Those most unfavorable to the theory of sanity said there were times at which the testator appeared to be mentally all right and there were times at which he appeared not mentally himself. The incidents which would indicate departures from the normal were the exceptions rather than continuous abnormal acts indicating a settled disturbed mental condition. The acts upon which the opinions rested may as well be attributed to habit, environment, idiosyncrasy, caprice, or infirmities of age as to mental disorder. That he was enfeebled by age during the latter months of his life there can be little doubt. No substantial evidence, however, tending to establish settled insanity or dementia or insane delusions or hallucinations on the part of the testator was adduced. There is absolutely nothing in his relations with his son, whom he visited in 1915 with the intention of remaining a member of his household, that would in anywise support the theory that the testator in concluding that he was not welcome, or at least that he would not be satisfied to remain with his son, was moved in so concluding by an insane delusion or hallucination. He made a trip across the continent on his own initiative to his son's home, investigated the situation, and decided that he would spend the remainder of his days in California. We have read the son's testimony describing the father's visit to him and it contains nothing that would support an inference that he was mentally unsound. [1] Proof of the existence of hallucinations or delusions is not alone sufficient to annul a 62 ESTATE OF MCDONOUGH. [200 Cal.
will unless such hallucinations or delusions bear directly upon the testamentary act. (Estate of Shay, 196 Cal. 355 [237 Pac. 1079]; Estate of Presho, 196 Cal. 639 [238 Pac. 944]; Estate of Gunther, 199 Cal. 119 [248 Pac. 514]; Estate of Perkins, 195 Cal. 699 [235 Pac. 45]; Estate of Purcell, 164 Cal. 300 [128 Pac. 932].)

Tested by a long list of decisions of this court the evidence in the instant case must be held to be insufficient as a matter of law to establish testamentary incapacity. Almost every act upon which contestant relies to establish incompetency has been considered by this court and its evidentiary weakness judicially pointed out. The opinions expressed by said witnesses founded upon facts and conditions described by them are not sufficient to overturn the uncontradicted evidence of the witnesses who testified to testator's sound mental condition at the very time the will was executed or at times very near thereto. [2] As has been said by this court in many decisions the question to be determined is not what might have been the mental condition of the testator, but what in fact was his mental condition at the time he made the will. (Estate of Perkins, supra; Estate of Relph, 192 Cal. 451 [221 Pac. 361]; Estate of Wilson, 117 Cal. 262 [49 Pac. 172, 711].) [3] The law presumes that the subscribing witnesses to the execution of a will had their attention drawn to and noted the mental capacity of the testator. The opinions of such witnesses are entitled to more weight than that of one who is merely passive. (Estate of Holloway, 195 Cal. 711 [235 Pac. 1012].) Besides the subscribing witnesses there was also present the pastor and spiritual adviser of testator. No one attempted to question the honesty or standing of said witnesses and no impeachment of their testimony was attempted. Paraphrasing the language in Estate of Carson, 74 Cal. App. 48 [239 Pac. 364], it may be said here, as it was said with respect to the testator in that case, that McDonough was able to and did keep in mind all things necessary to qualify him to make a will and was, as shown by the only evidence given as to his mental condition at the very time the will was made, free and able to act in its execution. A résumé of the testimony of those present at the time the will was made and as to which there is no direct contradiction, if indeed there can be said to be any evidence to show mental incompetency, follows: Dec. 1926.] ESTATE OF McDONOUGH. 63

The Reverend Timothy Galvin, while not a subscribing witness to the will, was present at the time of its execution. He first met Christopher McDonough in July, 1922, and he saw him frequently until the day of his death, June 5, 1924. He visited him in the capacity of spiritual adviser at the residence of Mr. and Mrs. Joyce, and his relations with him were of an intimate character. From the first time he met him to the day he made the will—a period of about two months—he saw him five or six times. Thereafter he saw him at least once, and frequently twice, monthly. During the entire period of his acquaintance he never knew of his doing an unusual or unreasonable act or heard him say an unreasonable thing. He gave intelligent answers to questions asked him and understood what he was doing and had the free use of his will power. He was cheerful at all times, and was always glad to see him and upon his departure invited him to return. At the time the will was executed there were present in the room at Mr. and Mrs. Joyce's residence Theodore Savage, Denis O'Shea, Mr. McDonough, and himself. The will was drawn and subsequently read to the testator in the presence of the persons above mentioned and Mr. McDonough was asked by Mr. Savage if he was satisfied with it and if it was his last will. He saw the testator sign it by affixing his mark to it and he saw the witnesses sign it as such. Some time in July the testator told Reverend Galvin that Mrs. Joyce had taken him in and had been very good to him and she intended to keep and care for him during the remainder of his life. He said he had some money and wished to leave it to her upon his demise. In a second conversation that took place about the first of August, four weeks before the testator executed the will, he repeated what he had previously said as to the kind treatment he had received at the hands of Mrs. Joyce and stated that it was his intention to leave to her the money he had on deposit with the Hibernia Savings and Loan Society. He also spoke of a business transaction he had with the Hibernia Savings and Loan Society that was not entirely satisfactory to him. The witness advised him to secure the services of a lawyer if he wished to make his will or transact important legal business. The witness informed Mrs. Joyce that the testator desired a lawyer to draft his will. The testator spoke of his family affairs and said he had a son in one of the eastern states— 64 ESTATE OF MCDONOUGH. [200 Cal.
the witness did not remember the particular state—but he did not want anything to do with him as he had visited him some years previous and received a poor welcome at his hands; that, in fact, his son "refused to give him a dinner; that he called one day and left on the next train." The testator did not appear to be more than seventy-five years of age and did not seem to be feeble for a man of his years. In fact, he appeared well. He did not complain of suffering from any ailment.

Denis O'Shea, a neighborhood merchant, was one of the witnesses to the execution of the will. He first became acquainted with the testator in 1919 and knew him intimately from the time he came to live with the Joyce family until his death, June 5, 1924. He had many conversations with him on various topics and had ample opportunity to observe him. There was nothing peculiar or unusual in his conversation or conduct at any of the times he met him and he appeared at all times to be perfectly sane. He used a stick or cane when walking and said that he had bed feet and could not trust himself on the hillsides. The Joyce home was in a hilly section of the city. He did not appear feeble or infirm, but was quite strong for a man of his age. The witness detailed a conversation he had with the testator on the increase of the cost of living above the ruling market prices of former years in which he gave concrete illustrations of the shrinkage in the purchasing value of money within his experience which would clearly indicate that he was well oriented as to the subject of the conversation. Other subjects were discussed and no diseased mental condition or mental fault was observed in the testator at any of the times the witness was thrown into contact with him. The witness was called to the Joyce home on August 29th by Mrs. Joyce to witness the testator's will. When he arrived the only persons he saw in the house were Father Galvin, Mr. Joyce and Mr. McDonough. Mr. Savage and Mrs. Joyce came afterward. The attorney excluded everyone from Mr. McDonough's room, closed the door, and spent some time with Mr. McDonough without the hearing or presence of any other person. Mr. Savage finally came out of the room and proceeded to write the will. Upon completing it he called the witness and Reverend Galvin into the room, where Mr. McDonough was sitting in a chair, and closed the door. Neither Mr. Dec. 1926.] ESTATE OF McDONOUGH. 65

Joyce nor Mrs. Joyce were in the room. Mr. Savage read the will over twice and asked the testator if he knew what the paper was and the testator replied that it was his will. He then signed it with a cross. The testator requested the witness to sign it and he complied with the request. Mr. Savage also signed as a witness.

Theodore J. Savage, an attorney who has practiced his profession for thirty years in San Francisco, testified that he drew the will under the instructions of the testator. A day or two before the will was drawn Mrs. Joyce, who was a total stranger to him, came to his office and stated that an old gentleman stopping at her house wished to make his will. She brought with her a card from Dr. George T. Brady, an acquaintance and an occasional client of the attorney. The attorney told Mrs. Joyce that he would be at the house either on the next or second day at a fixed hour and instructed her to have present two persons who were acquainted with Mr. McDonough to serve as witnesses to the execution of the will. Upon his arrival he found Father Galvin and Mr. O'Shea there. He was introduced to McDonough, who was fully dressed and seated in a chair. He talked with him at considerable length and, after taking his instructions in detail, went into the dining-room, from which all persons withdrew at his request, and he there drew the will which is assailed by contestant. He read the will aloud to the testator in the hearing of those present and discussed some of its provisions with him. The testator said he could neither read nor write and requested that the will be read a second time. He asked the attorney to write his name at the place where he was to affix his mark, declared the instrument to be his will, made his mark, and requested the attorney and Mr. O'Shea to sign as witnesses to its execution. The attorney testified that in his opinion the testator was perfectly sane in mind at the time he made his will, his reasons therefor being founded upon the conversation held with him for the purpose of obtaining necessary information to prepare the will. He asked the testator many questions which tested in a large degree his testamentary capacity. The testator stated that he was born in Ireland, and was seventy-eight years of age, and he talked generally about the different places he had visited in this country. He said the only property he owned was about eight thousand dollars deposited

200 Cal.—5 66 ESTATE OF McDONOUGH. [200 Cal.
with the Hibernia Savings and Loan Society. Upon inquiry as to his family history, the testator said he had been separated from his family for a great many years and had no communication with any member. He said he had a son named Daniel, residing in the east; that he visited him some seven or eight years prior with the intention of remaining, but he was not welcome and so came back to California. He stated that he was the father of other children, but that Daniel told him all the other children were deceased and that he did not know whether the issue of any deceased child was living. He wished to leave Father Galvin one hundred dollars to celebrate masses for the repose of his soul and the balance he wished to leave to Mrs. Joyce, as he and the Joyces had been friends for a long time. Mr. Savage inquired as to his health and the testator said he was all right except his feet and legs bothered him a great deal and he could not get around as well as he should. When asked by the attorney if he wanted him to draw his will, his reply was that he did. His appearance was good and he seemed bright and intelligent. There was nothing in his appearance to indicate that he was otherwise than perfectly competent to make a will. Asked if he had a place of deposit for his will, he said he once had a safe-deposit box but had surrendered it. The attorney informed him that he had a safe at his office and if he wished he would keep the will in his office and upon his death he would file it at the proper time with the county clerk. McDonough said that was very good and requested the attorney to preserve the will and file it at the proper time. The attorney gave him his professional card and told him that if he should thereafter desire to make any change in his will to call him up and he would come to him and make any change or changes which he might desire to make.

Dr. Thomas H. O'Connor was called to attend the testator during the latter days of August, 1922, close to the day on which the will was executed. The testator was at that time suffering from an eczemic condition in his lower limbs. He was able to walk about and there was nothing to indicate feebleness in his condition. His body was neither emaciated nor poorly nourished. The physician was of the opinion that the testator was of sound mind. Six months thereafter the physician was again called to attend him on account of Dec. 1926.] ESTATE OF McDONOUGH. 67

a cold he had contracted. He found McDonough's condition about the same as upon his previous visit. His arterial system then was, as no doubt the fact is with a vast majority of aged persons, in a condition of hardening. The testator, however, lived for more than a year thereafter and was frequently seen by neighbors and others upon the sidewalk and about the premises, and he appeared to be rational in both conversation and conduct. After the death of the testator the witness prepared the medical certificate of death wherein the cause of death was stated to be cerebral hemorrhage and the contributory cause arteriosclerosis. The physician testified in this connection that death was instantaneous upon the occurrence of the hemorrhage. Medical testimony was offered to establish as a fact that hardening of the arteries is common to most persons who have passed middle life. This knowledge is common to the laity. It is nature's inevitable law and marks the beginning of the disintegration of the human body. [4] It by no means follows, however, that testamentary capacity ceases with the approach of or even with the most advanced stages of arterial hardening. This condition or stage in life is but partial evidence to be considered in connection with other evidence in determining whether or not arteriosclerosis has shut off the blood supply to the brain to the extent that the mind is unable to correctly function. Any other theory would deprive almost every person who has passed middle life of the right to dispose of his estate by will. We have epitomized the testimony of the four witnesses, three of whom were present at the exact time the will was executed, two being subscribing witnesses, to show the testamentary competency of decedent at the period of time which the law regards as being of prime importance in this class of cases. Two of these witnesses were intimate acquaintances and testified to the sound and disposing mind of the testator not only at the time the will was executed but at other times very near to the day the will was executed, both prior and subsequent thereto. As to the other two, one was his physician who had attended him but a few days before he executed the will, and the other was an attorney whose first duty to his profession required him to satisfy himself that the testator was fully competent to make a will before engaging in an act which possessed the potentials of excluding heirs from their 68 ESTATE OF McDONOUGH. [200 Cal.
inheritances. Besides the testimony of the spiritual adviser, the lawyer and the layman who were present at the time the will was executed, which was not contradicted by direct evidence, other witnesses, four of whom seemed to have had no pecuniary interest in the result of the trial, gave testimony as to testator's mental soundness at the very time the will was made as well as at other periods of time both near to and remote from the day in question. John J. Matthew's acquaintance with the testator covered a period of seventeen years. After the testator came to reside at the Joyce home he saw him at least once, and sometimes twice, a month. His testimony was that he was bright and intelligent, seemed clear in mind and exhibited no peculiarities of conversation or conduct at any time. Miss Mary Ryan saw him while he was at the Joyce home at least once a week, conversed with him frequently, and pronounced him to be perfectly sane. Elizabeth Craig, a pupil attending the city public schools and a recent arrival from Ireland, the birthplace of herself and McDonough, visited the Joyce children practically every day and conversed with McDonough almost daily from the time he came to the Joyce home until his last illness. In her opinion he was perfectly sane.

Mr. and Mrs. Joyce both testified at length as to the circumstances under which McDonough came to live in their family. Mr. Joyce had known McDonough for many years prior to his marriage and the latter visited at the family home after said marriage. Mrs. Joyce was exceptionally kind to him during all the time he was at her home and cared for him tenderly during his last illness, which was somewhat protracted. McDonough was greatly pleased with the care and treatment he was receiving and expressed gratitude for the comforts of real home life. Both testified as to his competency.

Two medical witnesses were called in the case, one by the contestant and the other by the proponent. In response to a hypothetical question embracing substantially the same assumed statement of facts, one was of the opinion that the testator was of unsound mind and the other was of the opinion that he was mentally sound.

The fact that McDonough, beginning some time after he made his will, paid one hundred dollars monthly for the board, lodging, and care which he received is not pertinent Dec. 1926.] ESTATE OF McDONOUGH. 69

to the issue of his competency to make a will. The amount, however, was not unreasonable, under the circumstances of the case.

Contestant has quoted at considerable length from *Dunphy v. Dunphy*, 161 Cal. 380 [Ann. Cas. 1913B, 1230, 38 L. R. A. (N. S.) 818, 119 Pac. 512]. That case considered the question as to the degree of unsoundness of mind that must be proved to authorize a judgment annulling a marriage contract. We are not here considering the mental capacity requisite to make a valid marriage contract, which presupposes an understanding on the part of the contracting parties of the duties, obligations, and responsibilities of the marital state. Here we are considering merely the ability of the testator to make a simple will. The capacity requisite to do so has been repeatedly defined by decisions of this court and it is not necessary to cite specific cases. [5] In considering the question of a testator's competency the rule by which the evidence must be measured is thus stated: " . . . the issue does not rest upon the contestant's evidence alone. The testimony of proponent's witnesses must be taken into consideration in weighing the sufficiency of the contestant's case. Evidence which standing by itself might be sufficient to sustain a verdict may in the light of all the facts be wholly inadequate, and that without invading the province of the jury as the judges of the weight and sufficiency of the evidence." (*Estate of Casarotti*, 184 Cal. 73 [192 Pac. 1085].)

[6] Measured by the law of this state the evidence must be held to be insufficient to sustain the judgment.

The judgment is reversed.

[1] FIRE INSURANCE—CONSTRUCTION OF POLICIES—AMBIGUITY—EVIDENCE.—In actions upon fire insurance policies, in which the terms of the covering clauses are ambiguous, interpretation of such clauses may be aided by the circumstances attending the issuance of the policies.

[2] Id.—RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.—Where the agents who conducted the preliminary interviews with the insured were the agents of the insurers, and not of the insured, the terms of the covering clauses in the policies, which are ambiguous, are to be construed liberally in favor of the insured and strictly against the insurer, by reason of the fact that whatever ambiguity or uncertainty exists therein was caused by the insurer.

[3] Id.—COVERING CLAUSE—PROPERTY COVERED.—By the use of the word "rear" or of the clause "in the rear" in fire insurance policies, in describing merchandise and materials in a building, it must be held that it was the intention of the framers of the policies to refer merely to the location of the property to be covered by the insurance at the date of the issuance of the policies, and by the use of the term "additions adjoining and communicating," it was intended that the coverage clauses should apply to such stock of merchandise wherever situated in the insured's plant in the course of its progressive movement therein during the processes of manufacture.

[4] Id.—CONSTRUCTION OF POLICY.—Where an insured had for several years carried blanket insurance on the stock of merchandise in his manufacturing plant, and, in interviews held prior to the issuance of new policies, had been informed by the insurers' representatives, who were familiar with his place of business and manufacturing activities, that the board of fire underwriters had

notified the insurers not to issue policies of insurance in blanket form unless the insured would accept the insertion of a ninety per cent co-insurance clause in the policy, which the insured refused to consent to, and the new policies were written with blanket insurance and no requirement of co-insurance, the policies must be interpreted to cover the insured's stock wherever the same was to be placed in the "additions adjoining and communicating" with the plant during the course of manufacture.

APPEALS from a judgment of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County. Charles Welborn, Judge. Affirmed.

The facts are stated in the opinion of the court.

Chickering & Gregory, Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, H. F. Prince and E. H. Conley for Appellants.

Paul H. McPherrin and L. Frank Ottofy for Respondent.

RICHARDS, J.—The three cases, the appeal in each of which is before this court for determination, were consolidated and tried together upon an agreed statement of facts and certain other forms of evidence presented at such trial. Each of these actions was brought by plaintiff, doing business under the name of the Angelus Furniture Manufacturing Company, for the recovery of a sum of money alleged to be due by the defendant in each case according to the terms of an insurance policy and as the result of a fire which occurred in the plaintiff's premises. The question presented in each case involves an interpretation of the covering clause in each of these insurance policies. From the stipulated facts in the case and from the findings of the court based thereon it appears that the plaintiff at the time of the issuance to him of each of said policies, and for several years prior thereto, had been engaged in the business of manufacturing furniture in the premises wherein the stock of merchandise and material covered by each of said policies was located at the time of the issuance thereof and of the occurrence of the fire. The building wherein the plaintiff's said business was originally conducted was a two-story brick 72 SISKIN v. ALLIANCE INS. CO. [200 Cal.

building situate in the city of Los Angeles, between Stanford Avenue and Paloma Street, and described as Nos. 935–943 East Pico Street. Some years, however, before the issuance of these insurance policies the plaintiff had found that the increase in his business required the erection of an additional building and he had accordingly caused the same to be erected immediately adjacent to the former structure and as a part thereof, to the extent that the west wall of the earlier building formed, to the height thereof, the east wall of the added structure, and that through said common wall large openings, supplied with metal doors, were so placed as to furnish such full and adequate means of intercommunication as the convenience or necessities of the increasing business of the plaintiff required. The various departments of the manufacturing plant were so located in different parts of his amplified building that the raw materials to be used in the process of manufacture would be located in the rear of the older unit and would pass therefrom during the progressive processes of manufacture through the various portions of the amplified structure, until it was finally placed as a finished product in the storeroom thereof, from whence it passed out to the trade. For several years prior to the issuance of the policies here in question the plaintiff had carried insurance upon the large stock of materials and merchandise which were thus in process of manufacture, and the defendant in each of these cases had been among the number of insurance companies with whom his insurance policies had been placed. On October 14, 1920, when the insurance policy which he had theretofore carried with the Alliance Insurance Company of Philadelphia was about to expire, the authorized agents of said insurance company applied to the plaintiff for a renewal of said policy, and as the result of interviews between the agents of said company and the plaintiff the insurance policy which forms the basis of the action against said insurance company was issued and the agreed premium paid thereon. On April 28, 1920, a similar transaction occurred with relation to the insurance theretofore carried by the Niagara Fire Insurance Company of New York, and as a result thereof a similar policy was issued and the agreed premium paid thereon. On July 20, 1920, a like transaction occurred with relation to the insurance theretofore carried by the Netherlands Fire and Life Insur- Dec. 1926.] SISKIN v. ALLIANCE INS. CO. 73

ance Company of the Hague, Holland, and with the result that a like insurance policy was issued and the agreed premium paid thereon. Each of these insurance policies was in the standard form and in each of them the covering clause was substantially the same, reading as follows: "On stock of merchandise and materials . . . [describing same] all while contained in or attached to the two-story brick building and its additions, adjoining and communicating, situate Nos. 931–937, 929–933 rear East Pico Street." It is conceded that the stock of merchandise described in each of these policies was destroyed or damaged by the fire which occurred subsequently on March 18, 1921, within the plaintiff's above-described premises; and it is also conceded that the loss and damage resulting to plaintiff from said fire was duly ascertained and agreed upon between the parties, as set forth in the agreed statement of facts; thus leaving as the only matter for determination the respective proportions of said loss to be borne by each of said insurance corporations, depending upon the interpretation to be placed upon the aforesaid covering clause in each of said policies. [1] It was assumed by the respective parties to each of these actions upon the trial and also upon appeal that the terms of said covering clause are ambiguous and hence are to be aided as to the interpretation thereof by the circumstances attending the issuance of said policies. Accordingly, upon the trial of said actions certain affidavits which had theretofore been made by the persons who had acted as the agents of each of said insurers in the interviews with said plaintiff preparatory to the issuance of said policies and in the preparation and issuance thereof pursuant to such interviews were offered in evidence under the stipulation of the parties that they were to be considered as having the same effect as though the affiants had been present and testified to the facts therein stated. Upon the trial of said consolidated actions, as well as upon this appeal, the sole question which was and is presented for determination is as to whether the aforesaid covering clause in each of said policies amounted to blanket insurance upon the stock of merchandise described therein wherever situate in the premises of plaintiff at the time of the destruction thereof in said fire, or whether the said coverage was limited to the unit or section of said building desig- 74 SISKIN v. ALLIANCE INS. Co. [200 Cal.

nated as the rear thereof and to the portion of the stock of merchandise situate therein at the date of the fire.

[2] Before entering upon a consideration of the precise terms of the covering clause in each of said policies, certain principles of interpretation applicable to contracts of the character of those sued upon herein should be adverted to. It is a conceded fact herein that the insurance brokers or agents who conducted the preliminary interviews with the plaintiff herein prior to the issuance of each of said policies were the duly authorized agents of the respective insurance companies represented by each of them in said interviews and that they were in no degree agents or representatives of the plaintiff in the procurement and issuance of said policies or in the preparation or inclusion therein of the terms of the covering clause in each which is presented for interpretation upon these appeals. This being so, it is a well-settled rule of interpretation that the terms of said clause in said policies are to be construed liberally in favor of the insured and strictly against the insurer, and this by reason of the fact that whatever ambiguity or uncertainty exists therein has been caused by the insurer. (Mah See v. North Am. Acc. Ins. Co., 190 Cal. 424 [26 A. L. R. 123, 213 Pac. 42]; Maryland Casualty Co. v. Industrial Acc. Com., 178 Cal. 494 [173 Pac. 993]; Greer-Robbins Co. v. Insurance Co., 47 Cal. App. 63 [190 Pac. 189]; Civ. Code, sec. 1654; 26 Corpus Juris, pp. 74, 75, and cases cited; Aetna Ins. Co. v. Sacramento-Stockton S. S. Co., 273 Fed. 58.) Applying the foregoing principle to the facts of these cases as embodied in the agreed statement of facts presented at the trial thereof, and considering the same without reference to the affidavits above referred to as having been also read in evidence at said trial, we are unable to distinguish the facts of these cases from those presented and considered by the district court of appeal in the case of Greer-Robbins Co. v. Insurance Co., supra, wherein that court was called upon to interpret the provisions of an insurance policy substantially the same as those embraced in the coverage clauses of the three insurance policies here under review. The precise question presented in that case was whether goods, materials, and merchandise which were located in a rear room of the plaintiff's building at the time of the issuance of the insurance Dec. 1926.] SISKIN v. ALLIANCE INS. CO. 75

policy thereon remained covered by such insurance when removed therefrom to other portions of the plaintiff's building wherein they were located at the time of the occurrence of the fire. The insurance policy in that case referred to the property insured thereby as situate "in the rear" of plaintiff's building and purported to insure the same while contained in said building "and its additions"; and it was therein held in accordance with the rule of interpretation above set forth that by the use of the term "in the rear" the intent of the framers of the policy was merely to refer to the location of said property in said plaintiff's building at the date of the placing of the insurance thereon, and that the removal of said property to other portions of said building and its additions did not operate to take the same out of the insurance provisions of the policy. [3] Approving the rule of interpretation therein declared, we are constrained to hold that by the use of the word "rear" or of the clause "in the rear" in each of the policies here under review it was the intention of the framers thereof to refer merely to the location of the stock of merchandise to be covered by such insurance at the date of the issuance of the policies of insurance thereon, and that by the use of the term "additions adjoining and communicating" in each of said policies the framers thereof intended that the coverage clauses therein should apply to said stock of merchandise wherever situate in the plaintiff's plant in the course of its progressive movement therein during the processes of manufacture.

[4] It is, however, contended by the appellants herein that the foregoing interpretation of these policies has been rendered impossible of application by virtue of what appears in the affidavits of the insurance brokers or agents of said defendants having relation to their preliminary interviews with the plaintiff prior to the drafting of said policies, and to the form thereof and of the coverage clause placed therein as the result of such interviews. These affidavits disclose substantially the following facts, namely, that the plaintiff had for several years prior thereto carried blanket insurance upon the stock of merchandise in his plant and had placed the same through these brokers and agents of said respective defendants; that upon the occasion of said interviews held prior to the issuance of these policies the plaintiff 76 SISKIN v. ALLIANCE INS. CO. [200 Cal.

had been informed by the defendants' representatives, who were each thoroughly familiar with the plaintiff's place of business and with the character and nature of his manufacturing activities conducted therein, that the board of fire underwriters of Los Angeles had recently notified their respective companies not to issue policies of insurance in blanket form unless the insured would submit to and accept the insertion of a ninety per cent co-insurance clause in the policy; that the plaintiff expressed himself as opposed to the co-insurance clause plan, and that upon his expressing such opposition the agents of these respective insurance companies, being desirous of continuing to write insurance for said plaintiff, undertook to so write such insurance as to give the plaintiff the benefit of life insurance upon his said stock of merchandise, without appearing expressly so to do, in the form of the policies to be issued to him, and without the requirements of co-insurance; and that in accordance with this understanding and with such purpose in view these authorized agents of these respective defendants prepared and inserted in said policies their aforesaid coverage clauses, intending the same to have the effect of insuring the plaintiff's stock of merchandise not only while the same was located "in the rear" of his said plant, but wherever the same was to be placed in the "additions adjoining and communicating therewith" during the course of manufacture; and that in accordance with such understanding, purpose, and intent the coverage clause in each of said policies was inserted therein with the approval not only of the insurance corporations issuing the same but also of the board of fire underwriters. The effect of the foregoing statements on the part of the defendants' representatives is, in our opinion, precisely the opposite of that for which the appellants herein contend with relation to the interpretation to be placed upon the coverage clauses of said policies and which were so inserted therein not only after a thorough understanding upon their part as to what sort of insurance the plaintiff desired, but also after their express admissions that these policies were so prepared with a view to conforming to the plaintiff's said desire. If anything further were needed to justify the interpretation which the trial court placed upon the coverage clause in each of said policies in awarding the plaintiff the full relief sought, such justification was supplied by the Dec. 1926.] HALL v. IMPERIAL WATER Co. 77

evidence of the defendants' agents and representatives as above set forth. We are, therefore, of the opinion that the trial court acted correctly in so interpreting said policies as to award the plaintiff the full recovery sought thereon.

The judgment in each of said cases is affirmed.

MOTION to dismiss appeals from orders of the Superior Court of Imperial County. M. S. Marsh, Judge. Granted.

The facts are stated in the opinion of the court.

Jesse George for Appellant.

Luther G. Brown, Leon R. Yankwich, J. Stewart Ross and R. B. Whitelaw for Respondents.

THE COURT.—This is a motion to dismiss each of two appeals herein on the ground that the orders appealed from are not appealable orders. By stipulation of the parties, said two appeals have been consolidated.

On May 10, 1917, the appellant instituted a separate action against each of the above-named respondents in the superior court of the county of Imperial to recover damages for injuries to her land, alleged to have been caused by the seepage of water from the irrigation canals of said respondents. Judgment was entered in each of said actions on July 1, 1924, awarding damages to the appellant, and thereafter, on July 7, 1924, she filed a notice of motion for new trial in each cause. Among other grounds, the notices stated that the respective motions would be based on the alleged disqualification of the trial judge to hear said causes. The motions for new trial, however, were never made in open court. The time within which appeals from the judgments might be perfected and within which proceedings on motion for new trial would have to be determined has elapsed without any steps having been taken by the appellant in those directions other than as above indicated. Subsequently, and on February 18, 1925, approximately seven and one-half months after said judgments were entered, appellant served

4. See 14 Cal. Jur. 1063. Dec. 1926.] HALL v. IMPERIAL WATER CO. 79

and filed notices of motion to vacate and set aside each of said judgments on the ground that the judge who tried the causes was disqualified by reason of his owning real property in the Imperial Irrigation District. These latter motions came on for hearing in the court below on March 27, 1925, and were denied on May 29, 1925, by Honorable M. S. Marsh, Judge of the superior court of the county of San Diego, sitting as a judge of the superior court of the county of Imperial. As already indicated, the appeals herein are from the orders denying said motions to vacate and set aside the judgments in the above-entitled causes.

Respondents move to dismiss the consolidated appeals on the ground that an order refusing to vacate and set aside a judgment is not an appealable order. It is contended that there are but two exceptions to this rule, namely, where the matter specified in the motion to vacate could not have been reviewed on an appeal from the judgment and where the judgment affects injuriously one who is not a formal party to the action or, if a party, he has not received due notice so that the judgment as to him has been given improperly and *ex parte*. It is then urged that the instant appeals do not come within either of said exceptions for the alleged disqualification of the trial judge "was the ground for the motion to vacate the judgment" and "was also the chief ground for her motion for a new trial," and "the question of disqualification, being before the court below, on motion for new trial, its ruling on the matter was reviewable on appeal from the judgment," thus precluding, it is asserted, the instant appeals from the orders refusing to vacate and set aside the judgments on said ground.

In opposition thereto the appellant urges, among other things, that to grant respondents' motion to dismiss the appeals herein "would be setting at nought the rule that the judgment and all of the acts of a judge disqualified for interest . . . are absolutely void and must be disregarded wherever the fact of disqualification is made to appear. . . . "

Preliminary to a consideration of the question presented herein the following pertinent and well-settled principles should be kept in mind:

[i] Since the 1915 amendment to section 963 of the Code of Civil Procedure (Stats. 1915, p. 209) an order denying a motion for new trial is not an appealable order. (*Hughes* 80 HALL v. IMPERIAL WATER CO. [200 Cal.

v. *De Mund*, 195 Cal. 242, 246 [233 Pac. 94]; sec. 963, Code Civ. Proc.)

The legislature has provided, however, by means of an amendment to section 956 of the Code of Civil Procedure (Stats. 1915, p. 328), that such an order is reviewable on an appeal from the judgment. (*Hughes v. De Mund*, supra; sec. 956, Code Civ. Proc.)

[2] Under the general rule an order refusing to vacate and set aside a judgment is likewise not an appealable order. (*In re Yoder*, 199 Cal. 699 [251 Pac. 205]; *Bell v. Solomons*, 162 Cal. 105, 109 [121 Pac. 377].)

An exception to this latter rule provides that an order denying a motion to vacate and set aside a judgment is appealable where the record on an appeal from the judgment would not disclose the ground of the motion. (*In re Yoder*, supra; *Kent v. Williams*, 146 Cal. 3, 11 [79 Pac. 527].) As stated in *In re Yoder*, supra, such an order is an appealable order where the circumstances are such that an appeal from the judgment "would be vain for lack of a record showing the rights of the aggrieved party."

[3] In our opinion an application of the foregoing principles to the instant appeals requires that they be dismissed. As stated above, the appellant herein instituted proceedings for new trial in each cause by filing her notices of intention to move for such relief. And, though these motions were never made viva voce, the new trial proceedings were terminated in each cause by the expiration of the statutory period (sec. 660, Code Civ. Proc.) and would be reviewable on an appeal from the respective judgments. This being so, the orders denying appellant's motions to vacate and set aside the judgments are not appealable orders for they present matters which would have been reviewable on appeals from the judgments.

[4] Moreover, the motions to vacate the judgments were made, as indicated above, approximately seven and one-half months after the entry of said judgments. The authorities declare that a motion to vacate a judgment not void on its face, as is the case here, must by analogy with the provisions of section 473 of the Code of Civil Procedure be made within six months from the entry thereof. (*Consolidated Constr.* Dec. '26.] HERMINGHAUS v. SOUTH. CALIFORNIA EDISON Co. 81

For the foregoing reasons the motion to dismiss the consolidated appeals herein is hereby granted.

AMELIA HERMINGHAUS et al., Respondents, v. SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON COMPANY (a Corporation) et al., Defendants; SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON COMPANY (a Corporation), Appellant.

[1] WATERS AND WATER RIGHTS—SEASONAL ACCRETIONS TO RIVER—CHARACTER OF.—Seasonal accretions to the waters of a natural stream which are variable in quantity in the course of each and every year, being largest at times of heavy rainfall in the watershed and also in the spring and summer by reason of melting snow in the mountains, which accretions are natural and regular, and occur in their usual expected and accustomed seasons, lasting through several months in the annual change of seasons of every year, constitute the usual and ordinary flow of the stream and are in no sense "storm," "flood," "vagrant," or "enemy" waters, as these terms are used in law.

[2] Id.—RIPARIAN OWNERS—RIGHT TO ACCRETIONS OF STREAM.—Owners of lands riparian to a river are entitled to their riparian rights in the entire flow of the waters of the river considering the same with its seasonal accretions as the usual and ordinary flow of the stream during each and every year.

[3] Id.—SLOUGHS—RIPARIAN RIGHTS.—Sloughs which take from a river at all stages and carry their water in well-defined channels, with banks and bottoms, to another slough, and other sloughs which take directly from the river at higher stages and likewise conduct their waters in similar channels to said slough, a distance of some miles, and other sloughs, having no mouths entering the river's banks, but taking water either by seepage from the main river or at times when the river overflows its adjoining banks, all of

1. See 25 Cal. Jur. 1109.
2. See 25 Cal. Jur. 1109.
3. See 25 Cal. Jur. 1083.

200 Cal.—6 82 HERMINGHAUS v. SOUTH. CALIFORNIA EDISON Co. [200 Cal.

which sloughs conduct their waters in well-defined channels and which waters are never stationary but move in a current and have been doing so for many years, constitute legal watercourses; and the lands bordering on them are riparian lands which have a right to the flow of the water as it was, by nature, wont to flow, subject only to the reasonable use by riparian owners on the river at points above said lands.

[4] Id.—CONNECTION OF SLOUGHS WITH RIVER.—The fact that sloughs make their connection with the main channel of a river at elevations which permit the waters thereof to enter the sloughs only when the increment in the water makes possible their passage, does not militate against their quality as watercourses.

[5] Id.—RIPARIAN OWNERS—RIGHTS IN STREAM—NATURE AND EXTENT OF.—The rights of the riparian owners to the use of the waters of an abutting stream are paramount to the rights of any other persons thereto, and such rights are part and parcel of the land and any diminution of the stream against the will of the riparian owner by other persons is an actionable injury, an injury to the inheritance. The right to the flow of the water is inseparably annexed to the soil, and passes with it, not as an easement or appurtenant, but as a parcel. Use does not create, and disuse cannot destroy or suspend it. Each person through whose land a watercourse flows has (in common with those in like situation) an equal right to the benefit of it as it passes through his land, for all useful purposes to which it may be applied; and no appropriator of land on the same watercourse has a right unreasonably to divert it from flowing into his premises, or to obstruct it in passing from them, or to corrupt or destroy it. What is such reasonable use is a question of fact, and depends upon the circumstances appearing in each particular case.

[6] Id.—USE OF WATER—ARTIFICIAL CONTRIVANCES TO DIMINISH USE.—The fact that owners of riparian lands might by artificial contrivances, through dams, ditches, and reservoirs, involving large expenditures of money, so interrupt or regulate the present natural flow of the river as to render a smaller quantity of its waters sufficient to satisfy the beneficial uses which they are now making of such waters in their entirety, cannot operate to limit or lessen their riparian rights to the uses of the water in their natural course.

[7] Id.—RIGHT TO UNDERFLOW OF STREAM.—The rights of owners of agricultural land riparian to a river inhere not only in the upper flow of the waters which actually enters upon and permeates and fructifies the soil of the riparian lands, but also in the underflow of the river which lifts the upper flow thereof to the levels of entry upon such lands, and passes by to uplift the levels of lower

5. See 25 Cal. Jur. 1063, 1068; 27 R. C. L. 1071.
7. See 25 Cal. Jur. 1100. Dec. '26.] HERMINGHAUS v. SOUTH. CALIFORNIA EDISON Co. 83

riparian lands along the course of the river. The underflow of the stream is, with respect to riparian rights therein, no more waste waters than is the upper flow thereof which the riparian owner uses, since without the uplift of the former the outflow and beneficial use of the latter could not exist.

[8] Id.—USE OF WATER—DEVELOPMENT OF POWER.—An owner of lands riparian to a stream is entitled to use the water, in addition to the customary use for domestic purposes and for irrigation of riparian lands, for the purpose of development of power and electric energy; subject, however, to the duty imposed on all riparian owners and users of water to make a present return of such waters to the course of the stream without undue waste or diminution.

[9] Id.—UPPER RIPARIAN OWNERS—IMPOUNDING OF WATER FOR PRODUCTION OF POWER.—An upper riparian owner has no right to impound the waters of a river for the development of power and electric energy, where this would have the effect of causing a diversion of the waters which constitute the usual and ordinary flow of the river for periods and to an extent which would practically effectuate a withdrawal of said waters from a large portion of the lands of lower riparian owners during the period in each season when they are benefited by its flow and overflow.

[10] Id.—RIPARIAN RIGHTS—NATURE OF—COMMON LAW—PUBLIC POLICY.—By the adoption of the common law in 1850, riparian rights became vested; and riparian owners are entitled to have the stream flow past their land in its usual course, which right, so far as it is of regular occurrence and beneficial to their lands, is a right of property which neither a court nor the legislature can deprive the owner of upon the ground that the water may be more beneficially used by others.

[11] Id.—UPPER RIPARIAN OWNERS—TAKING OF WATERS FOR POWER PURPOSES—CONTRACT OF THIRD PERSONS.—The fact that upper riparian owners, seeking to impound the waters of a river by a system of reservoirs, have entered into a contract with one owner of riparian lands, restricting them to a certain limited reservoiring of the water, dependent upon the consent of their co-contractors, cannot affect the rights of other riparian owners, not parties to the contract, to have the unobstructed natural flow of the water.

[12] Id.—APPROPRIATION OF WATER—EFFECT OF.—It has long been settled in this state that an appropriation of water under the code divests no private existing right, but its effect is merely to give a preference over a subsequent appropriator or diverter who takes under no other right or title, and to fix the date of the posting of the notice as the inception of the claim under it.

[13] Id.—SECTION 1419, CIVIL CODE—AMENDMENT OF 1911—CONSTRUCTION.—The amendment of 1911 to section 1410 of the Civil Code, with reference to the rights of appropriators of water, is not retroactive, and cannot operate to divest riparian rights already vested at the time it was enacted.

[14] Id.—WATER COMMISSION ACT OF 1913—CONSTRUCTION OF.—Waters of a river which have been for a period of more than ten consecutive years last past, and are being, applied to useful and beneficial purposes upon lands riparian thereto, are not the proper subject of appropriation under section 11 of the Water Commission Act of 1913 (Stats. 1913, p. 1012).

[15] Id.—DETERMINATION OF BENEFICIAL USE—POWER OF LEGISLATURE—WATER COMMISSION ACT—POLICE POWER.—The legislature has no right, under its police power, to determine what are the "useful and beneficial purposes" to which lands held in private ownership shall be devoted or the uses to which vested riparian rights which are an integral part thereof shall be limited, as declared in section 42 of the Water Commission Act.

[16] Id.—RIGHTS OF LESSEE OF FEDERAL GOVERNMENT—NAVIGABLE WATERS.—The right to sequester and store a large quantity of the water of a navigable river, for the development of power and electric energy, to the detriment of lower riparian owners, is not supported by a claim that it is done in aid of navigation as lessee of the United States government, which is the owner of certain lands on the upper reaches of the river and its tributaries, where the United States government has not transferred to the lessee any right or power to be exercised in aid of navigation and the plan contemplated the diversion of large quantities of the water for indefinite periods.

[17] Id.—ESTOPPEL—SUFFICIENCY OF EVIDENCE AND FINDINGS.—It is held in this action that the findings and conclusions of the trial court with reference to the plea of estoppel on the part of the plaintiffs to interfere with the appellant's alleged project and plans for the construction of its proposed system of reservoirs and storage plants sufficiently dealt with the matter and were sustained by the evidence.

RICHARDS, J.—This appeal is from a judgment in the plaintiffs' favor in an action brought by them to obtain an injunction preventing the defendants from an alleged actual and proposed diversion of the waters of the upper San Joaquin River and its tributaries to the irreparable injury of the plaintiffs through the interference thereby with riparian rights of the latter in and to the flow and use of the waters of said river upon, along, and across their lower lying lands contiguous to the banks and course of said river. The plaintiffs in their original complaint herein allege that they are the owners and tenants in possession of a certain large tract of land containing about 18,000 acres in the counties of Fresno and Madera, state of California, and extending along the bank of the main channel of the San Joaquin River for a distance of about twenty miles, the said land being as to the whole thereof riparian to said river and the said plaintiffs having, for many past years, in the exercise of their riparian rights therein, made appropriate use of the waters of said river for the irrigation, overflow, and enrichment of their said lands and of the whole thereof. The plaintiffs proceed to allege that the defendants, being the occupants of Dec. '26.] HERMINGHAUS v. SOUTH. CALIFORNIA EDISON Co. 87

lands lying along the reaches of the San Joaquin River and its tributaries above to the location of the plaintiffs' lands, claim some right in and to the waters of said river and to the use thereof adversely to the rights of the plaintiffs therein and by virtue of such claims are threatening by dams, reservoirs, and other works to stop the flow of said river and to impound the waters thereof in and thereby to divert the waters of said river impounded and to convey the same away from said river at points above the plaintiffs' said lands so as to prevent the waters of said river from flowing through the courses and channels thereof down to and along, across, and over the said lands of plaintiffs, and to thus deprive the latter of the use and enjoyment thereof to their great and irreparable injury. The fuller particulars of the plaintiffs' utilization of the waters of said river and of the nature of the defendants' actual and threatened interference with such uses as alleged in said complaint will be set forth at a later point in this opinion. To the plaintiffs' complaint the defendants presented their answer, wherein and in certain amendments thereto they proceeded by denials and by affirmative averments to set forth twelve separate defenses to the plaintiffs' alleged cause of action. The particulars of these will also be adverted to in their proper order in the course of this decision. It is sufficient here to state that the said defendants by their said answer and defenses put in issue the averments of the plaintiffs' complaint respecting the nature of the rise and flow of the waters of said river as related to the plaintiffs' asserted right to the use thereof as lower riparian owners along the banks and courses thereof, and also put in issue the question as to the fullness and extent to which the plaintiffs' said lands, or certain portions thereof, are riparian to said stream. To these two primary considerations the trial court addressed itself in its findings of fact and in its conclusions of law based thereon; and it would seem that these should be the first to receive our consideration before passing to the other questions discussed upon this appeal and which must necessarily be to a greater or less degree predicated thereon.

The trial court found upon sufficient evidence, which was not materially conflicting, that the San Joaquin River was a natural stream of water with well-defined channels and banks 88 HERMINGHAUS v. SOUTH. CALIFORNIA EDISON Co. [200 Cal.

which, with its tributaries, took its rise in the Sierra Nevada Mountains and descended thence in a general westerly course to the plains of the San Joaquin Valley, and thence in a general northwesterly direction through the counties of Madera, Fresno, Merced, Stanislaus, and San Joaquin to the San Francisco Bay; that the said river in its usual, ordinary, and natural flow passed along and over the lands of the plaintiffs herein; that the natural flow of water in the said San Joaquin River is, and has always been and always will be, if unobstructed, variable in quantity in the course of each and every year; that is to say, the same is, has been, and will be largest and most abundant at times of heavy rainfall over its watershed in said mountains in each winter season, and will also have a larger accretion in the spring and summer season by reason of the melting of the snows in said mountains; that these annually occurring accretions in the amount and flow of the waters of said river are natural and regular, and occur in their usual, expected, and accustomed seasons and result in an increased amount and flow of the waters of said river as they proceed by, along, and across the lands of said plaintiffs, lasting through several months in the annual change of seasons of every year. From these findings of fact based upon evidence which is indisputable the conclusion is inevitable that the waters of the San Joaquin River annually flowing therein before and during and after these regularly occurring accretions in the volume thereof constitute the usual and ordinary flow of said river and are in no sense "storm" or "flood" or "vagrant" or "enemy" waters as these terms are understood in law. This has in fact been so definitely determined by the decisions of this and other courts having precise reference to the waters of this and of other similar streams taking their sources in the same range of mountains and owing their periodical accretions to the same general causes, as to be no longer a matter susceptible of serious dispute. In the case of *Miller & Lux v. Madera Canal etc. Co.*, 155 Cal. 59 [22 L. R. A. (N. S.) 391, 99 Pac. 502], this court was called upon to determine the nature of the annual flow of the waters of the Fresno and also of the San Joaquin Rivers, which streams take their rise in the same general region and are subject to the same periodic and climatic conditions. It was in that case contended by the defendant that the waters it proposed to divert did not Dec. '26.] HERMINGHAUS v. SOUTH. CALIFORNIA EDISON Co. 89

constitute any part of the ordinary or usual flow of these rivers, but were waters occurring during periods of heavy rains and were storm, freshet, and flood waters as distinguished from the ordinary and usual flow of said rivers, and that as such the defendant was entitled to impound, divert, and use the same. On the other hand, it was claimed by the plaintiff that the rise in the flow of the waters in said rivers was not extraordinary, occurring upon rare occasions, but that such flow and overflow occurred in all years of ordinary rain and snowfall and constituted the regular annual and usual flow of said rivers. The trial court found in that case, as in this case, that the claim of the plaintiff relative to such waters was correct, and this court in sustaining such finding and conclusion used the following language:

"Upon this showing it cannot be said that a flow of water, occurring as these waters are shown to occur, constitutes an extraordinary and unusual flow. In fact, their occurrence is usual and ordinary. It appears that they occur practically every year and are reasonably expected to do so, and an extraordinary condition of the seasons is presented when they do not occur; they are practically of annual occurrence and last for several months. They are not waters gathered into the stream as the result of occasional and unusual freshets, but are waters which on account of climatic conditions prevailing in the region where the Fresno River has its source are usually expected to occur, do occur, and only fail to do so when ordinary climatic conditions are extraordinary—when a season of drouth prevails."

Again, the court says:

"This is the character of the waters of the Fresno River, the flow of which it is shown the defendant intends to divert. These overflow waters, occasioned through such usually recurring floods and freshets, are not waters which flow beyond the natural channel boundaries of the stream which nature has designed to confine their flow; they are not waters which depart from the stream or are lost or wasted; they flow in a well-defined channel in a continuous body and in a definite course to the San Joaquin River, and while they spread over the bottom lands, or low places bordering on the main channel of the Fresno River as it carries its stream during the dry season, still this is the usual, ordi- 90 HERMINGHAUS v. SOUTH. CALIFORNIA EDISON Co. [200 Cal.

nary, and natural channel in which they flow at all periods of overflow, the waters receding to the main channel as the overflow ceases."

And finally the court concluded:

"In the present case the storm and freshet waters are not something distinct and separate from the ordinary waters of the Fresno River. As a fact, and under the authorities, being annually recurring floods and freshets flowing in a clearly defined channel, they constitute a part of the ordinary flow of the waters of such river."

[1] In the case of *Piper v. Hawley*, 179 Cal. 10, 17 [175 Pac. 417], this court expressly approved the doctrine laid down in the foregoing case to the effect that annually recurring floods, even though the flow of their waters made the stream wider during the period thereof so as to include adjoining lands, are yet to be deemed a part of the ordinary flow of the stream. In the case of *California Pastoral etc. Co. v. Enterprise C. & C. Co.*, 127 Fed. 741, the circuit court of the United States, sitting in and for the southern district of California, and having under consideration a case wherein the particular lands affected by the present controversy and the riparian rights of the owners and occupants thereof in relation to the San Joaquin River were involved, decided that the waters of the San Joaquin River which the defendant in that case was proposing by means of a canal and dam to divert from their accustomed flow in said river along and over the Herminghaus lands were not storm or freshet waters which any person who can may impound and use, but that such waters constituted the usual and ordinary flow of said river in which the full riparian rights of the owners of said lands inherited. In the case of *Lindblom v. Round Valley Water Co.*, 178 Cal. 450 [173 Pac. 994], this court said with relation to the facts of said case: "The evidence is clear to the effect that the water running into Round Valley (and, except as interrupted by the defendant down North Canyon) consisted of the runoff from the usual and annually recurring fall of rain and snow. Such water, when running in a defined stream, constitutes a watercourse to which the riparian proprietor's rights attach." (Citing *Miller & Lux v. Madera etc. Co.*, supra.) Dec. '26.] HERMINGHAUS v. SOUTH. CALIFORNIA EDISON Co. 91

[2] In the presence of the foregoing consistent rulings of this court and of the federal court having reference to the precise or similar conditions relative to the annual, usual, ordinary, and regularly recurring outflow of the San Joaquin River during the varying seasons of each and every year we are constrained to hold that in so far as the lands of said plaintiffs shall be found to be riparian to said river they are entitled to the exercise and enjoyment of whatever riparian rights they shall be determined to be invested with, in the entire flow of the waters of said river considering the same with its seasonal accretions as the usual and ordinary flow of said stream during each and every year.

[3] The next question to which our consideration should logically be directed is as to what are the riparian rights of the plaintiffs in respect to said river and the waters thereof. This question is divisible into several parts, the first of which involves the inquiry as to how much of the plaintiffs' said tract of land is riparian to the San Joaquin River. The findings of the trial court germane to this inquiry show that the plaintiffs' large tract of land lies in a position of peculiar and unique vantage in its relation to the San Joaquin River, since said tract of land not only extends for a goodly number of miles along the bank of the main channel of said river, but also lies just at the base of the lower reaches of the Sierra Nevada Mountains, from which the river makes its immediate debouchment into the plain, and in the apparent stress of which it has cut numerous minor channels or sloughs, so called, twenty-two in number, which parallel or intersect each other and which extend into and in some instances across the plaintiffs' tract of land and which convey the waters of said river which enter the same at different seasons of the year out upon or over said lands and finally conduct the residue of such waters back into the main channel of the river. Upon this subject the findings of the trial court are, we think, fully sustained by the evidence and are quite lengthy and detailed but are also very instructive. The opinion of the trial court rendered in deciding this cause makes the following summary of these detailed findings which will suffice for the purposes of this decision: "The evidence in this case shows that some of the sloughs that traverse the Herminghaus property, such as sloughs 19, 20 and 22, take from the river at all stages and carry their 92 HERMINGHAUS v. SOUTH. CALIFORNIA EDISON Co. [200 Cal.

water in well-defined channels, with banks and bottoms, to Fresno Slough. Others of the sloughs, such as number 1 and number 9, take directly from the river at higher stages and likewise conduct their water in similar channels across the Herminghaus property to Fresno Slough, a distance of some miles. Others of the main sloughs have no mouths entering the river's banks, but take water either by seepage from the main river or at times when the river overflows its adjoining banks. After the water has entered these sloughs, they conduct the same in well-defined channels across the Herminghaus property to Fresno Slough. The testimony showed that the water in these sloughs was not stationary but was moving in a current. The evidence also showed that these sloughs, or at least the ones the descriptions of which have heretofore been set forth, carry water as above set forth each year during the late spring and summer months when the San Joaquin River has been raised by waters from the melting snow. The testimony also showed that these sloughs for many years have been conducting water in this manner. It appears to me, therefore, that there is every element here that goes to make up a legal watercourse. These sloughs have definite beginnings, definite channels with banks and bottoms and a definite ending in Fresno Slough. Likewise, there is a permanent source from which they take water during certain seasons of the year. I am forced to the conclusion, therefore, that these sloughs, are in fact, and in law, watercourses, and that the lands bordering on them are riparian lands, and have a right to the flow of the water as it was, by nature, wont to flow, subject only to a reasonable use by riparian owners on the San Joaquin River, at points above said lands." With the foregoing conclusions of the trial court with reference to the nature of these twenty-two channels or sloughs as watercourses conveying the waters of the said river to practically all the lands of these plaintiffs, thus rendering the same and the whole thereof riparian to the San Joaquin River, we entirely agree. [4] The fact that some of these sloughs make their more or less definite connection with the main channel of said river at elevations which permit the waters thereof to enter said sloughs only when the increment in the quantum of such waters reaches a height and volume which makes possible their passage into the same, in no way mili- Dec. '26.] HERMINGHAUS v. SOUTH. CALIFORNIA EDISON Co. 93

tates against their quality or utility to the plaintiffs as watercourses since the plaintiffs are, as we have seen, entitled to the beneficial use of said waters in some degree at least at all times and under all conditions attending the usual and ordinary flow of said stream.

This conclusion leads us to our next consideration, which involves the nature, extent, and limitations of the plaintiffs' riparian rights in and to the use of the waters of the San Joaquin River in connection with their ownership and uses of their said tract of land. We shall first consider this subject abstractly and without reference to the bearing upon it of those rights which the defendants possess as upper proprietors upon the San Joaquin River. The plaintiffs in their complaint aver that for more than ten years prior to the commencement of this action they were and have since been the owners in fee of the 18,000 acres of land described in their said complaint located in the San Joaquin Valley and bordering on the San Joaquin River; that the climate of that portion of the San Joaquin Valley is arid and as a result thereof their said land, unless irrigated, is unfit for cultivation or the growing of profitable crops thereon; that the soil is naturally fertile and very productive if water is supplied thereto; that the natural flow of the waters of the San Joaquin River is variable in quantity, being more abundant during the period of rainfall in the winter season and also during the late spring and summer when the snows upon its watershed in the high Sierras melt and contribute their accretion to said river; that during these periods in the augmented natural flow of said river the waters thereof flowed naturally out and over the plaintiffs' said lands and saturated the same and deposited thereon a very fertile silt which enriched said land and caused an abundant growth of grasses thereon as the same would not have grown except for said natural irrigation by the overflow of said waters and the deposit of said silt; that said waters reached said land as to the lower portions thereof, which are described as swamp and overflow land lying immediately adjacent to the lower reaches of said river, by direct overflow therefrom, but that said waters reached the upper portions of said tract of land during said periods of abundant flow by means of the numerous sloughs or channels which have been hereinbefore referred to; that as the quantity of water flowing in said 94 HERMINGHAUS v. SOUTH. CALIFORNIA EDISON Co. [200 Cal.

river diminishes, the area of said lands covered by the flow of said river in its higher stages would diminish until such waters would be confined to the said channels which traverse said lands and would then seep into and moisten the same while such waters continued to flow in said restricted channels; that any artificial change in the natural flow of the waters of said river which would cause a further diminution in the quantum of the flow thereof would result, to the extent of such diminution, in the cessation of the accustomed overflow of the river directly and through the aforesaid numerous channels thereof and would, if sufficiently extended, cause the waters of said river to proportionately cease to enter said sloughs or channels or to continue to flow therein and would thereby diminish the area of said lands thus irrigated and enriched and render the same, to the extent of such deprivation, arid and unsuitable for the growth of grasses or other products thereon and thus destroy the value and profitable use of the same. The answer of said defendants put in issue the aforesaid averments of the plaintiffs' complaint in those portions of its several defenses wherein they controvert the plaintiffs' claim that those parts of the plaintiffs' said lands which are traversed by the aforesaid channels and sloughs other than the main channel of said river, or are affected by the overflow from the former, are areas of said lands which are riparian to said river; or that the waters of said river which enter the same during periods of its most abundant flow constitute the usual and ordinary flow of said river; or that plaintiffs are entitled thereto as riparian proprietors along the course of said river; or, if so, to the extent and nature of the uses and benefits to which the said plaintiffs claim the right as such riparian proprietors to put and continue to utilize said waters. The trial court upon the particular issues thus joined found the aforesaid averments of the plaintiffs' complaint to be true.

[5] We are satisfied from a careful review of the evidence in this case that it sufficiently sustains the findings of the trial court in the foregoing regard; and this being so it becomes necessary for us at this point to review the history and development of the law of riparian rights in this state. We are saved the necessity of an extended elaboration of the earlier stages of that development by the decision of this court in the leading case of *Lux v. Huggin*, 69 Cal. 255 [4 Pac. 919, Dec. '26.] HERMINGHAUS v. SOUTH. CALIFORNIA EDISON Co. 95

10 Pac. 674], wherein, in the longest opinion in the judicial history of this court, the growth and development of the doctrine of riparian rights under the common law, in other jurisdictions, and finally in California since its adoption of the common law in the year 1850, through a course of judicial decision down to the date of the determination of that cause upon appeal, is exhaustively reviewed. While it is true that the decision in the case of *Lux v. Haggin* was that of a divided court, we think it is also true, as stated by Mr. Chief Justice Shaw in his most able review of the "Development of the Law of Waters in the West," to be found in the appendix to 189 Cal., at page 779 et seq., that "It declared that the rights of the riparian owners to the use of the waters of the abutting stream were paramount to the rights of any other persons thereto; that such rights were parcel of the land and that any diminution of the stream against the will of the riparian owner by other persons was an actionable injury. The question was settled by that case and the riparian right has never since been disputed." When we turn to that notable decision to determine just what was thus settled in the way of a definition of the riparian right we find that it is embraced in the following conclusions by Chief Justice Shaw of Massachusetts in the case of *Johnson v. Jordan*, 2 Met. 239 [37 Am. Dec. 85], which this court therein adopted and approved in the following language (page 391): "The right to the flow of water is inseparably annexed to the soil, and passes with it, not as an easement or appurtenant, but as a parcel. Use does not create, and disuse cannot destroy or suspend it. Each person through whose land a watercourse flows has (in common with those in like situation) an equal right to the benefit of it as it passes through his land, for all useful purposes to which it may be applied; and no proprietor of land on the same watercourse has a right unreasonably to divert it from flowing into his premises, or to obstruct it in passing from them, or to corrupt or destroy it." In a later portion of the opinion this court said (page 394): "By our law the riparian proprietors are entitled to a reasonable use of the waters of the stream for the purpose of irrigation. What is such reasonable use is a question of fact, and depends upon the circumstances appearing in each particular case." The doctrine of riparian rights thus abstractly stated has 96 HERMINGHAUS v. SOUTH. CALIFORNIA EDISON Co. [200 Cal.

been clarified, though not materially changed, by this court in its application to the particular cases which have come before it since the decision of the case of *Lux v. Haggin*, supra. The case of *Heilbron v. Last Chance Water Ditch Co.*, 75 Cal. 117 [17 Pac. 65], was one wherein the tenant in possession of a large tract of land riparian to Kings River brought suit to restrain a diversion of the waters of said river by an upper appropriator who had diverted a large body of the waters of such river and conveyed the same by a ditch to land not riparian to said river. In setting forth the original right of the plaintiff to have said stream continue to flow as by nature it was wont to flow over, through, or along his land, this court said: "It seems clear, upon principle and authority, that the diversion of natural water from land is 'an injury done to the inheritance.' The flow of natural water over land is a continuous source of fertility and benefit; and its withdrawal is followed by consequences which are perpetually injurious to the freehold. This is strikingly illustrated by the averments in the complaint in this case, 'that the waters of said Kings River have hitherto been accustomed to overflow, seep through, and moisten the lands of said rancho, whereby the fertility of said lands was greatly increased, and a large and valuable quantity of natural grass was produced upon said lands'; and that, by reason of the diversion of the water by defendant, 'said lands have failed to produce their accustomed crops of natural grass.' The flow of the water of a stream, whether it overflows the banks or not, naturally irrigates and moistens the ground to a great and unknown extent, and thus stimulates vegetation; and the growth and decay of vegetation add, not only to the fertility, but to the very substance and quantity of the soil. It is not true, therefore, as claimed by appellants, that the water of a natural stream may be taken away from land for a great number of years, and then turned back, without any permanent injury to the land." In the case of *Southern California Investment Co. v. Wilshire*, 144 Cal. 68 [77 Pac. 767], wherein the controversy was between the plaintiff as a lower and the defendant as an upper riparian proprietor along a certain stream, this court said: "The plaintiff has riparian rights in the stream, and this right extends to all the water flowing Dec. '26.] HERMINGHAUS v. SOUTH. CALIFORNIA EDISON Co. 97

in the stream through its lands, . . . As such riparian owner, it has the right to have the stream continue to flow through its lands in the accustomed manner, and to use the same to irrigate an additional area thereof, undiminished by any additional or more injurious use or diversion of the water upon the stream above. This right is a part of the estate of the plaintiff—parcel of its land,—and whether it is or is not as valuable in a monetary point of view, or as beneficial to the community in general, as would be the use of a like quantity of water in some other place, it cannot be taken by the defendants without right, or, in case of a public use elsewhere, without compensation. It is not necessary in such cases for the plaintiff to show damages, in order that it may be entitled to a judgment. It is enough if it appears that the continuance of the acts of the defendants will deprive it of a right of property, a valuable part of its estate."

(Citing cases.) In the case of *Anaheim Water Co. v. Fuller*, 150 Cal. 327 [11 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1062, 88 Pac. 978], wherein the plaintiffs, who were lower riparian owners along the Santa Ana River, sought to enjoin the defendants, who were upper riparian owners upon said river, from diverting water from the stream by means of a ditch through which said defendants proposed to convey such water to other lands not riparian to the stream, the defendants, among other contentions, urged that the plaintiffs were actually using but 400 inches of water for their land, and that there would remain in the stream after the defendants' proposed diversion more than 2,000 inches flowing down to and beyond the plaintiffs' lands and which was more than the latter could possibly use thereon, and that, therefore, no damage could ever ensue, even conceding the defendants' diversion to be unlawful, and hence that their said diversion ought not to be enjoined. Mr. Justice Shaw, in dealing with this contention, said (page 335): "The theory of the law of riparian rights in this state is that the water of a stream belongs by a sort of common right to the several riparian owners along the stream, each being entitled to sever his share for use on his riparian land. The fact that a large quantity of water flows down the stream by and beyond the plaintiffs' land does not prove that it goes to waste, nor that the plaintiffs are entitled to take a part of it, as against other riparian owners or users below. Nor can it be said that plaintiffs,

200 Cal.—7 98 HERMINGHAUS v. SOUTH. CALIFORNIA EDISON Co. [200 Cal.

on account of the present abundance, could safely permit defendants to acquire, as against them, a right to a part of the water. The riparian right is not lost by disuse, and other riparian owners above may take, or others below may be entitled to take, and may insist upon being allowed to take all of the stream, excepting only sufficient for the plaintiffs' land. In either alternative, the taking of a part of the water by the defendants would not leave enough for the plaintiffs' use. There is nothing in this case to show how much water is required above and below by those having rights in the stream. In view of the well-known aridity of the climate and the high state of cultivation in the vicinity, the court could almost take judicial notice that in years of ordinary rainfall there is no surplus of water in the stream over that used by the various owners under claim of right. But, however this may be, it is settled by the decisions above cited that a party, situated as the plaintiffs are, can enjoin an unlawful diversion, in order to protect and preserve his riparian right." In the case of *Modoc L. & L. S. Co. v. Booth*, 102 Cal. 151 [36 Pac. 431], the plaintiffs, who were the owners of swamp and overflowed land riparian to the Pitt River, sought an injunction to prevent the defendants, who were upper but nonriparian owners of land, from appropriating 200 inches of water from said river for irrigation, stock, and domestic uses upon their nonriparian lands. The evidence in the case showed that the plaintiffs were engaged in reclaiming their said swamp and overflowed lands by ditching and diverting the waters of the Pitt River away from the same at times of the high flow of said river during the months of June, July, August, and September when the defendants used the comparatively small amount of the water of the river appropriated by them. The trial court denied the injunction sought and this court affirmed its order to that effect, saying: "The only point made for a reversal is that the court erred in not granting an injunction against the respondent, because appellants were riparian owners and as such 'entitled to have the stream flow in its natural channel, undiminished and unobstructed.' In a state like this, where irrigation is greatly needed, and where large areas of land are comparatively worthless unless artificially irrigated, it is difficult to lay down a rule as to riparian rights which will be applicable to and cover all cases. It Dec. '26.] HERMINGHAUS v. SOUTH. CALIFORNIA EDISON Co. 99

seems clear, however, that in no case should a riparian owner be permitted to demand, as of right, the intervention of a court of equity to restrain all persons who are not riparian owners from diverting any water from the stream at points above him, simply because he wishes to see the stream flow by or through his land undiminished and unobstructed. In other words, a riparian owner ought not to be permitted to invoke the power of a court of equity to restrain the diversion of water above him by a nonriparian owner, when the amount diverted would not be used by him, and would cause no loss or injury to him or his land, present or prospective, but would greatly benefit the party diverting it. If this be not so, it would follow, for example that an owner of land bordering on the Sacramento River in Yolo county could demand an injunction restraining the diversion of any water from that river for use in irrigating nonriparian lands in Glenn or Colusa county. And yet no one, probably, would expect such an injunction, if asked for, to be granted, or, if granted, to be sustained." In the case of *Fifield v. Spring Valley Water Works*, 130 Cal. 552 [62 Pac. 1054], this court applied the rule above quoted from the last cited case to a situation wherein the defendant, a nonriparian appropriator, was seeking to divert the storm or flood waters of a stream but none of the ordinary flow. In the case of *Miller & Lux v. Madera Canal etc. Co.*, 155 Cal. 59 [22 L. R. A. (N. S.) 391, 99 Pac. 502], which has already been adverted to as to its facts, it was urged upon this court upon petition for rehearing that it had not given due consideration to its rulings in the cases of *Modoc Land Co. v. Booth*, and *Fifield v. Spring Valley Water Works*, last above referred to, but this court differentiated between the two cases last above referred to and the case of *Anaheim Water Co. v. Fuller*, supra, and also between those former cases and the instant case before it, by showing that the instant controversy was not one relating merely to storm or flood waters, but that the pending cause involved the usual and customary flow of the Fresno River and the right of a lower riparian owner thereto as against an upper appropriator of the waters of said stream. In the course of this differentiation, Mr. Justice Sloss, after approving the language of the main opinion to the effect that the owners of land bordering upon such a 100 HERMINGHAUS v. SOUTH. CALIFORNIA EDISON Co. [200 Cal.

flow of water are riparian proprietors entitled to all the rights pertaining to riparian ownership, went on to say: "It is suggested that a different rule should apply in a semi-arid climate like that of California, where the fall of rain and snow occurs during only a limited period of the year, and, consequently, streams carry in some months a flow of water greatly exceeding that flowing during the dry season, with the result that such increased flow is not, at all points, confined within the banks which mark the limits of the stream at low water. But no authority has been cited, and we see no sufficient ground in principle, for holding that the rights of riparian proprietors should be limited to the body of water which flows in the stream at the period of greatest scarcity. What the riparian proprietor is entitled to as against nonriparian takers is the ordinary and usual flow of the stream. There is no good reason for saying that the greatly increased flow following the annually recurring fall of rain and melting of snow in the region about the head of the stream is any less usual or ordinary than the much diminished flow which comes after the rains and the melted snows have run off. Perhaps other considerations should apply where a river, in times of heavy flow, runs over its banks in such manner that large volumes of water leave the stream and spread over adjoining lands to an indefinite extent, there to stagnate until they evaporate or are absorbed by the soil. But the evidence of respondent, and this was the evidence on which the court below acted, fails to show that the water which defendant seeks to divert was such 'vagrant water.' The evidence of respondent was to the effect that at all seasons the water of the Fresno River, even though overflowing the banks of the channel in which it flowed during the dry season, formed a single and, continuously flowing stream. The argument that the method of irrigation adopted by plaintiff, i. e., that of having the annual increased flow of the river spread over its lands, was not a reasonable use of the water can have no weight in this case. The doctrine that a riparian owner is limited to a reasonable use of the water applies only as between different riparian proprietors. As against an appropriator who seeks to divert water to nonriparian lands, the riparian owner is entitled to restrain any diversion which will deprive him of the customary flow of water which is or may be beneficial to his Dec. '26.] HERMINGHAUS v. SOUTH. CALIFORNIA EDISON Co. 101

land. He is not limited by any measure of reasonableness. If any doubt ever existed on this point, none can remain since the recent decision of this court in *Anaheim Union Water Co. v. Fuller*, 150 Cal. 327 [11 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1026, 88 Pac. 978]. The cases relied on to show that the riparian owner is entitled to only a reasonable use of the water were all cases of controversies between owners of different parcels of land riparian to the same stream. Virtually the same point is presented by the argument that plaintiff is not limiting itself to the most economical manner of using the water. This is not an objection which may be raised by an appropriator who seeks to divert water of the stream to non-riparian lands. It is argued that unless appropriators are permitted to divert and store for future use water which would otherwise run into the sea and be wasted, there will be a failure to make the most beneficial use of the natural resources of the state and that riparian owners should not be permitted to obstruct the development of these resources. It may be that, if nonriparian owners are permitted to intercept the winter flow of streams, in order to irrigate non-riparian lands, or to develop power, the water so taken will permit the cultivation of more land and benefit a greater number of people than will be served if the flow continues in its accustomed course. But the riparian owners have a right to have the stream flow past their land in its usual course, and this right, so far as it is of regular occurrence and beneficial to their land, is, as we have frequently said, a right of property, 'a parcel of the land itself.' Neither a court nor the legislature has the right to say that because such water may be more beneficially used by others it may be freely taken by them. Public policy is at best a vague and uncertain guide, and no consideration of policy can justify the taking of private property without compensation. If the higher interests of the public should be thought to require that the water usually flowing in streams of this state should be subject to appropriation in ways that will deprive the riparian proprietor of its benefit, the change sought must be accomplished by the use of the power of eminent domain. The argument that these waters are of great value for the purposes of storage by appropriators and of small value to the lower riparian owners defeats itself. If 102 HERMINGHAUS v. SOUTH. CALIFORNIA EDISON Co. [200 Cal.

the right sought to be taken be of small worth, the burden of paying for it will not be great. If, on the other hand, great benefits are conferred upon the riparian lands by the flow, there is all the more reason why these advantages should not, without compensation, be taken from the owners of these lands and transferred to others." The case of *Arroyo Ditch & Water Co. v. Baldwin*, 155 Cal. 280 [100 Pac. 874], cannot be said to be at variance with the foregoing principles or cases since the questions discussed therein arose in an action wherein a lower riparian proprietor was claiming the right gained by prescription as against the upper riparian owner to have a certain *quantum* of the waters of the common stream flow down to him for purposes of diversion. The court in such a case was not called upon to discuss the principles enunciated in the case of *Miller & Lux v. Madera Canal etc. Co., supra*, but doubtless had that case in mind since it is reported upon earlier pages of the same volume of our reports; and whatever the court may have said in developing the later case cannot be held to be in anywise hostile to its utterances in the earlier one. Neither do we find anything in the case of *Gray v. Reclamation Dist.*, 174 Cal. 622 [163 Pac. 1024], or in the earlier case of *Lamb v. Reclamation Dist.*, 73 Cal. 125 [2 Am. St. Rep. 775, 14 Pac. 625], each dealing with the particular situation therein considered, which is in conflict with the case of *Miller & Lux v. Madera Canal etc. Co., supra*, and its companion line of cases which seem to deal with the identical situation as to the state and flow of the streams in question presented by the case at bar. We are unable to draw the differentiations which the appellant and certain of the *amici curiae* herein would have us see between the case of *Miller & Lux v. Madera Canal etc. Co.*, and this one in the foregoing regard; nor are we referred either by appellant or the *amici curiae* to any later decision of this court which has materially modified the decision in the last above cited case in its application abstractly to the rights of riparian owners to the usufruct of streams identical in their origin and outflow to that of the San Joaquin River.

As a result of the foregoing review of the cases which have succeeded and have generally followed the doctrine declared in the early case of *Lux v. Haggin, supra*, we arrive at the Dec. '26.] HERMINGHAUS v. SOUTH. CALIFORNIA EDISON Co. 103

following conclusions: The waters of the San Joaquin River as they approach and pass along, through, and over the lands of the plaintiffs herein at all seasons of the year constitute the ordinary, usual, periodical, and natural flow of said river. They are not "flood" waters, or "storm" waters, or "vagrant" waters, or "enemy" waters which are the result of occasional or unusual freshets and which anyone having the ability so to do may impound or divert, and who in most cases confer a blessing upon lower riparian land owners by so doing. The plaintiffs herein are riparian owners along the course or courses of the San Joaquin River and their tract of land is practically all riparian to said river, either directly along and beside the main channel thereof or through the contiguity of the upper portions thereof to the numerous sloughs putting off from said river and interpenetrating these higher areas of their said tract of land. As such riparian owners said plaintiffs are abstractly entitled to the reasonable use of the said waters of said river at all seasons of the year. Their right thereto is to the usufruct of said flowing stream in the usual and ordinary course of its flow, and this right is a vested right inherent in the soil of their said lands and not a mere incident or appurtenant thereto. It is a right which is neither gained nor lost by use or disuse abstractly and in the absence of adverse rights gained by others by prescription or of their loss by laches creating an estoppel under certain conditions hereinafter to be noted. It is a right which they partake of in common with other riparian proprietors along said stream entitled to a similar usufruct in its waters. It is a right which appropriators of water from said stream do not, as we shall see, share with the riparian owners thereon in the absence of rights to the use of said waters gained by such appropriators by grant or by prescription.

Having thus defined and limited the right of the plaintiffs as riparian owners along the San Joaquin River to the use and enjoyment of the waters thereof, we pass next to the question as to what the trial court has found to be the extent of the plaintiffs' right to the reasonable use and enjoyment of the waters of said stream under the particular circumstances as shown by the evidence in the case. The trial court found, as we have seen, that practically all of the plaintiffs' tract of land is riparian to said river. The trial court has further 104 HERMINGHAUS v. SOUTH. CALIFORNIA EDISON Co. [200 Cal.

found specifically what particular benefit the various areas of the plaintiffs' said tract of land of different elevations derive from the intake, flow, and overflow of the waters of said river through and by means of the several sloughs which take off from said river at such respective elevations in the land, and which carry a varying content according to their location, and also to the amount of accretion in the flow of the river at certain seasons of the year. Having so found, the trial court proceeds to find as follows: "That the climate of that portion of the San Joaquin Valley in which the said land described in said Schedule A is located is naturally arid, and the annual rainfall is very slight, and, as a result thereof, the said land, unless irrigated otherwise than by annual rainfall, is unfit for cultivation or the growing of profitable crops, but the soil, 10,000 acres or more thereof, is very fertile and by the use of said waters of the San Joaquin River and its branches, is rendered very productive and abundant crops of natural grasses can be and are produced thereon, as herein specifically stated, and with water to irrigate the same the said land is adapted to the growing of cereals, viticultural and horticultural crops, vineyards, garden truck, grain and berries. The balance of said soil blends with different degrees of alkali from the quality of said 10,000 acres of land to land impregnated with alkali in such quantities that the land must be reclaimed from it in order that anything other than natural grasses will grow thereon, and the process of this reclamation of the land from alkali is being accomplished by the overflow aforesaid."

The trial court further found: "That all the water which will flow in the San Joaquin River and its branches, as it and they were wont to flow by nature would be beneficial to the land of plaintiffs which is overflowed thereby as aforesaid, for the entire period and in the entire quantity that it is accustomed to so overflow said land." The foregoing findings of the trial court are, in our opinion, sufficiently supported by the evidence in the case. We are further entirely satisfied that the foregoing utilization by the said plaintiffs of the waters of said river and the flow and underflow and overflow thereof constitutes a reasonable use thereof within the intent and meaning of the foregoing definitions of the riparian right of land owners along such or similar Dec. '26.] HERMINGHAUS v. SOUTH. CALIFORNIA EDISON Co. 105

streams. It is to be noted that apart from certain general similarities of location, topography, adaptability, and quality the plaintiffs' tract of land as to its position, adaptability, and soil qualities, when taken in its relation to the San Joaquin River and the aforesaid natural distribution of the waters thereof, is peculiar, and in fact unique. From the evidence in the case as reflected by the findings of the trial court it would seem to be a tract of land especially designed and equipped by nature for pastoral uses; but even if it were not thus peculiarly adaptable to the irrigation and growth of wild grasses for the pasture of stock; even if it were equally or even more advantageously susceptible of adaptation to more intensive and even more profitable agricultural, horticultural, or viticultural uses, we are unable to perceive under what showing or claim of right any other land owner along said river, or any would-be appropriator of the waters thereof, or any aggregation of individuals, or any court or even the state itself, would have the right to dictate to these plaintiffs, choosing to devote their said lands and the water which, in its ordinary and usual flow, as an integral part and parcel thereof, to its present beneficial uses, that they should devote their said lands and the water flowing thereon to other and more intensive uses which such individuals or such aggregation or such court or such state might deem to be more in keeping, and, so to speak, more up to date with modern development in the productive uses of property. To admit the right to such interference to the extent of taking away from the individual his initiative in deciding to which of several adaptable uses he shall devote his property would be to divest him to that extent of his most precious right of ownership therein. In so stating we are not to be understood as dealing with or denying the right of the state in the proper exercise of its police power to regulate the uses, within certain well-defined limitations, of private property. We shall revert to this subject at a later point in this opinion. √

[6] It is, however, contended by the defendants herein that the trial court placed a vital limitation upon its foregoing findings as to the extent of the right of the plaintiffs to the use and flow of the entire body of the waters of said river entering upon and flowing through and over their said lands by appending thereto and to the last above quoted 106 HERMINGHAUS v. SOUTH. CALIFORNIA EDISON Co. [200 Cal.

portion of finding "30" an additional sentence which would make said finding "30" read in full as follows: "That all the water which will flow in the San Joaquin River and its branches, as it and they were wont to flow by nature would be beneficial to the land of plaintiffs which is overflowed thereby as aforesaid, for the entire period and in the entire quantity that it is accustomed to so overflow said land, but a constant flow of 180 cubic feet of water per second from April 1st to October 1st of each year would irrigate the lands of plaintiff, if the same were prepared for intensive cultivation, which preparation would entail a large expenditure of money, but in the present condition of the land all the water flowing in said main and branch channels is necessary for the irrigation of said land." We are unable to perceive that the emphasized sentence of said finding "30" as above quoted in full amounts to a limitation in any degree upon the foregoing findings of the trial court to which the same is appended. The fact that these plaintiffs might by artificial contrivances through dams and ditches and reservoirs, involving large expenditures of money, so interrupt or so regulate the present natural flow of said river as to render a smaller quantum of its waters sufficient to satisfy the beneficial uses which they are now making of such waters in their entirety, could not possibly operate to limit or lessen their riparian right to the usufruct of said waters in their natural course and under plaintiffs' unique relation thereto. Were it otherwise, the clause in our foregoing definition of the riparian right to the effect that such right is neither gained by use nor lost by disuse would be meaningless. But more than that; to require of these plaintiffs that they install expensive improvements upon nature's method for the purpose of lessening the quantum of the said water to be used by them below that full amount thereof to which they are in the natural exercise of their riparian right entitled would be to impose a like duty upon all the other riparian owners along the lower reaches not only of this particular stream but of all other streams of like origin and outflow, in order that some upper riparian proprietor or nonriparian appropriator might have, gain, and exercise rights to the use and diversion of said waters thus conserved, to which they would not otherwise be entitled. To so declare would be to impose Dec. '26.] HERMINGHAUS v. SOUTH. CALIFORNIA EDISON Co. 107

a radical and, in its outworking, an utterly impracticable limitation upon the doctrine of riparian rights. The impracticability of such a proposition might, if time and space would permit, be made the subject of almost endless illustration. [7] The rights which the plaintiffs assert herein inhere not only in the upper flow of said waters which actually enters upon and permeates and fructifies the soil of riparian lands, but also in the underflow of said river which lifts the upper flow thereof to the levels of entry upon such lands, and which, having done so, passes by to uplift its peak, in turn, to the levels of lower riparian lands along the course of said river through the plain. The underflow of streams is, with respect to riparian rights therein, no more waste waters than is the upper flow thereof which the riparian owner uses, since without the uplift of the former the outflow and beneficial use of the latter could not exist. Such waters are therefore serving a useful and beneficial purpose in relation to said lands. The foregoing findings of the trial court dispose, we think, of the question as to the reasonableness of the plaintiffs' use of the waters of said river in view of the unique advantages which nature has bestowed upon them in respect to their said lands. Had nature not been thus kind; had the plaintiffs originally been obliged at large expense and by artificial means to dig the watercourses, create the channels, and make the connections at various levels for the intake of the waters of the river to which as riparian owners they were entitled, it could not, we think, be reasonably contended that their conduct in so doing was so unreasonable as to justify upper appropriators upon said stream in taking away their riparian rights in the waters of the stream which they had thus artificially and at great expense applied to their lands. Neither could it be said that the amount of water of said river which is thus lifted to the varying levels of plaintiffs' lands and enters upon and flows over the same by means of the channels which nature has provided is to be held unreasonable merely because it exceeds the volume which the trial court suggested would be sufficient, if conserved and distributed through expensive artificial methods and appliances. As against appropriators the plaintiffs were not obliged by artificial appliances or otherwise to limit their natural use and enjoyment 108 HERMINGHAUS v. SOUTH. CALIFORNIA EDISON Co. [200 Cal.

of the waters of said river, nor can it be said, as supported by either reason or authority, that a lower riparian owner, as against an upper riparian owner attempting to impound a greater amount of the waters of the stream than that to which he would be entitled under his well-defined riparian right, should have cast upon him the burden of limiting by artificial contrivances his natural use and enjoyment of said waters in order that the upper riparian owner may make other and greater uses thereof than those to which he is lawfully and naturally entitled. There is nothing in the record herein tending in any degree to show that the defendants herein ever offered, or would be willing to offer, to reimburse the plaintiffs for any portion of the cost, expense, and outlay which would be required in order to limit the amount of water entering upon plaintiffs' land to the amount thereof indicated by the trial court as susceptible of being made reasonably adequate through such artificial means.

We have now reached the point in this discussion where the rights and claims of right of the appellant in and to the use of the waters of the San Joaquin River and its tributaries come into view. The appellant is a riparian owner of considerable lands along the upper reaches of said river and its tributaries. It is also a lessee or licensee from the United States government of certain other lands in the same region and riparian to the same river; and as such lessee or licensee thereof is admittedly entitled to the use and exercise of whatever riparian rights the federal government has in respect to said river by virtue of its ownership of said lands. It is in its aforesaid capacity as an upper riparian proprietor along said river that its rights as such therein are first to be considered. Generally speaking, it has the same usufruct in the waters of said river as all other riparian owners along the course thereof possess. It is entitled to the reasonable use of said waters and of the ordinary and usual flow thereof for such customary and domestic uses as inhere in riparian owners along similar streams, and for irrigation of their said riparian lands. Being an upper riparian owner along said stream and the tributaries thereof, it is entitled to the benefit of whatever reasonable waste or diminution in the volume of said waters occurs during and Dec. '26.] HERMINGHAUS v. SOUTH. CALIFORNIA EDISON Co. 109

in the course of the reasonable exercise of its riparian rights therein. [8] In addition to the foregoing usual and customary uses of said waters, the appellant is entitled to make appropriate use of the same for the development of power and electric energy. (Mentone Irr. Co. v. Redlands Elec. L. & P. Co., 155 Cal. 323 [17 Ann. Cas. 1222, 22 L. R. A. (N. S.) 382, 100 Pac. 1082].) In so holding this court further held that the production of power upon riparian land was a proper riparian use of the waters flowing thereon, even though the power and energy so developed was to be conveyed away and used at distant points not riparian to such lands. The uses made by the defendants herein as upper riparian proprietors of the waters of said river for purposes of irrigation and for domestic uses are negligible and are not in dispute in this proceeding; and as to the use of said waters for the production of power and electric energy the plaintiffs herein concede to the defendants the right to such use as being within the defendants' riparian right, subject, of course, to the duty imposed upon all riparian owners and users of water to make a present return of such waters to the course of the stream without undue waste or diminution. [9] This concession does not satisfy the claims of the defendants herein or of the various amici curiae who have come forward to support the defendants' contentions as to the extent of their rights as upper riparian proprietors to the use, for the aforesaid purpose, of the waters of said river. These claims of the defendants are set forth in their answer herein where they appear in the form of several separate defenses, which we shall deal with in turn. The first of these affirmative defenses consists in the claim of the defendants that in the course and exercise of their conceded right to a reasonable use of the waters of said stream for the development of power and electric energy they have the right to build reservoirs at various points along the upper reaches of said river and the tributaries thereof for the storage of the waters of said river to the extent set forth with much of detail in their said answer. With reference to the averments therein, and to the past, present, and prospective work of said development in the planning and building of such reservoirs, a vast amount of evidence was presented at the trial of the cause. The trial court found that the said defendants did 110 HERMINGHAUS v. SOUTH. CALIFORNIA EDISON Co. [200 Cal.

claim and assert their right to construct such reservoirs to the extent and capacity shown by the evidence in the case and set forth with much of detail in the findings therein; and the trial court further found from such evidence that the proposed sequestration of the waters of said river, in the system of reservoirs shown to be partially in course of construction and wholly within the contemplation and plans of the defendants, would, if permitted to be completed and carried into operation according to their aforesaid claims and plans and purposes, have the effect of causing a diversion of the waters which constitute the usual and ordinary flow of said river for periods and to an extent which would practically effectuate a withdrawal of said waters from a large portion of the lands of said plaintiffs during the period in each season when they are benefited by its flow and overflow, especially in and through those sloughs and channels which are wont to convey such waters to the plaintiffs' higher lands. The conclusion of law of the trial court based upon its foregoing findings of fact was that the claim of right asserted by said defendants, in so far as the same was sought to be grounded in the alleged rights of the defendants as upper riparian proprietors along the course of said river, was not sustainable as a matter of law. We are asked upon this appeal to review and reverse that conclusion. We are not urged so to do upon the ground that the evidence presented at the trial does not fully sustain the findings of fact of the trial court upon which its aforesaid conclusion of law was predicated. On the other hand, the defendants frankly admit that their proposed plans for the storage of the waters of said river in its vast system of reservoirs hold in contemplation the retirement of said waters for long and indefinite periods of time; in fact, admit that as to certain of said reservoirs the sequestration of the portion of the said waters stored therein will be cyclic; and as to said waters as a whole and to the extent of their retention in said reservoirs, their ultimate return to the river would depend not at all upon the claims and asserted rights of lower riparian owners to the usual, natural, and ordinary flow of said waters, but altogether upon the will and convenience of the defendants in their proposed utilization of said waters for power production. The defendants do not, in support of their aforesaid claim of right, in so far as the same is based solely upon Dec. '26.] HERMINGHAUS v. SOUTH. CALIFORNIA EDISON Co. 111

riparian ownership, direct our attention to any decision by the courts of this state which does more than vaguely hint at any possible merit in such a claim. We are, however, referred to a line of decisions by the courts of certain of the older states wherein a qualified right of an upper riparian proprietor to impound the waters of a stream has been recognized. We have examined these cases only to find that they have reference in the main to a mere temporary detention of water by dams during periods of scant flow in order to the uninterrupted operation of mills or water-wheels which would otherwise be insufficiently supplied with their usual and expected quantum of water required for their continued activities, the water being presently returned to the stream. Such cases have no bearing upon such an extensive, prolonged, and indefinite storage, withdrawal, and sequestration of the waters which form the usual and ordinary flow of such a stream as the San Joaquin River to the inevitable detriment of not one but all of the lower riparian owners and users of such waters. The asserted right of the defendants herein as riparian owners along said river and incidentally the asserted rights and claims of all those who have appeared herein as amici curiae claiming similar rights in similar rivers in this state would, if permitted, put an end to the whole doctrine of riparian rights, not only as to these plaintiffs and all other lower riparian owners similarly situated, but also as to the defendants themselves; since any person or aggregation of persons having the financial ability and acquiring a riparian ownership in lands above those of the defendants along the yet higher reaches of said river would thus become entitled to exercise all the rights which the defendants are here claiming, even against them, with the resultant drying up of the defendants' own reservoirs. [10] Two answers might well be suggested to the claims of the defendants and of their supporting amici curiae of a present right to thus break down and destroy the long-established doctrine of riparian rights upon the ground of public policy. One of these is to be found in the apt expression of our Chief Justice Shaw in his admirable review of the "Development of the Law of Waters in the West" above referred to, wherein he says: "The obvious answer on the question of policy is that the objection comes too late, that it should have been made to the legislature in 1850 prior to the enact- 112 HERMINGHAUS v. SOUTH. CALIFORNIA EDISON Co. [200 Cal.

ment of the statute adopting the common law. When that was done the riparian rights became vested, and thereupon the much more important public policy of protecting the right of private property became paramount and controlling. This policy is declared in our constitutions, has been adhered to throughout our national history, and it is through it that the remarkable progress and development of the country has been made possible." And the other equally apt answer is to be found in the opinion of Mr. Justice Sloss in the case of *Miller & Lux v. Madera Canal etc. Co., supra*, wherein that learned jurist said: "The riparian owners have a right to have the stream flow past their land in its usual course, and this right, so far as it is of regular occurrence and beneficial to their land, is, as we have frequently said, a right of property, 'a parcel of the land itself.' Neither a court nor the legislature has the right to say that because such water may be more beneficially used by others it may be freely taken by them. Public policy is at best a vague and uncertain guide, and no consideration of policy can justify the taking of private property without compensation. If the higher interests of the public should be thought to require that the water usually flowing in streams of this state should be subject to appropriation in ways that will deprive the riparian proprietor of its benefit, the change sought must be accomplished by the use of the power of eminent domain. The argument that these waters are of great value for the purposes of storage by appropriators and of small value to the lower riparian owners defeats itself. If the right sought to be taken be of small worth, the burden of paying for it will not be great. If, on the other hand, great benefits are conferred upon the riparian lands by the flow, there is all the more reason why these advantages should not, without compensation, be taken from the owners of these lands and transferred to others." [11] The defendants herein, however, make the contention that the foregoing disastrous consequences to the plaintiffs particularly and to the law of riparian rights generally will not occur for the reason, as they expressly plead and show, the said defendants have entered into a certain original contract and certain supplementary contracts thereto with Miller & Lux, a riparian owner of large tracts of land in the same immediate region as are the lands of these plaintiffs, and that the de- Dec. '26.] HERMINGHAUS v. SOUTH. CALIFORNIA EDISON Co. 113

fendants' obligations under said contracts compel them to a certain limited reservoiring of the waters of said river, dependent upon the consent of their co-contractor and to the making of certain releases and restorations of the said impounded waters to and also at the will of the other party to said agreement. It would be illuminating to quote these contracts in full for the purpose of showing the admissions which this appellant made therein as to the particular lower riparian owner with which it was dealing as to the right of the latter to the full ordinary flow of the waters of said stream; but we deem it sufficient to say at this point in the opinion with relation to said contracts that these plaintiffs were not parties thereto or otherwise bound or other than indirectly benefited thereby; and that said contracts between the parties thereto were of course subject to change or even abrogation by the parties thereto at any time and that without the plaintiffs' concurrence or consent. They cannot, therefore, be held to have their individual rights to require that the waters of said river be permitted to continue to unobstructedly flow as by nature they are wont to do affected by the existence of private agreements between other riparian owners along said stream to which they were not parties. A further consideration of these contracts may become appropriate at a later point in this opinion.

[12] We have thus disposed, we think, of the assertion by the appellant of a right to reservoir and indefinitely divert and detain the waters of this stream to the extent claimed by it merely as an upper riparian owner to the detriment of the plaintiffs as shown by the evidence in the case and the findings of the trial court sufficiently based thereon. The appellant makes the further claim of right to reservoir, sequester, and eventually use the waters of said river to the full extent of its disclosed plans in that regard based upon its asserted right so to do as an appropriator of the waters of said stream. Primarily, it may be said that in so far as the rights and claims of the appellant as an appropriator rest upon the contention that the waters in and to the use or diversion of which such rights and claims are asserted are flood or waste waters of said stream, that contention has been fully disposed of by what has been decided in an earlier part of this opinion. In so far as the

200 Cal.—8 114 HERMINGHAUS v. SOUTH. CALIFORNIA EDISON Co. [200 Cal.

appellant claims any right arising out of its previous appropriation of the water of said river made under and in conformity with sections 1410 to 1422, inclusive, of the Civil Code relating to the acquisition of waters in this state by appropriation in accordance with the method therein provided, such claim of right is sufficiently disposed of by the numerous decisions of this court which are collated and commented upon in the case of Duckworth v. Watsonville Water Co., 170 Cal. 425 [150 Pac. 58], wherein Mr. Justice Shaw made the following significant statement: "The argument on this point is partly, if not entirely, based on the theory that an appropriation of water, under the code, constitutes a grant by the state of a right to take the water appropriated, a grant which confers upon the appropriator a title or right to the water superior to private rights, riparian or otherwise, existing at the time of the appropriation. This theory seems to persist in the minds of members of the bar. It finds no support in the decisions of this court. It has long been settled in this state that an appropriation under the code divests no existing private right, that its effect is merely to give a preference over a subsequent appropriator or diverter who takes under no other right or title, and to fix the date of the posting of the notice as the inception of the claim under it. (De Necochea v. Curtis, 80 Cal. 402, 405 [20 Pac. 563, 22 Pac. 198]; Wells v. Mantes, 99 Cal. 584 [34 Pac. 324]; Alta Land Co. v. Hancock, 85 Cal. 223 [20 Am. St. Rep. 217, 24 Pac. 645]; Cave v. Tyler, 133 Cal. 566 [65 Pac. 1089]; Santa Cruz v. Enright, 95 Cal. 113 [30 Pac. 197]; Frederick v. Dickey, 91 Cal. 358 [27 Pac. 742]; Coonradt v. Hill, 79 Cal. 593 [21 Pac. 1099]; Watterson v. Saldunbehere, 101 Cal. 112 [35 Pac. 432]; Lux v. Haggin, 69 Cal. 390 [4 Pac. 919, 10 Pac. 674]; Palmer v. Railroad Com., 167 Cal. 168 138 Pac. 997].)" [13] In the petition for rehearing in the above last cited case it was particularly insisted that a significant change had been made in section 1410 of the Civil Code by the amendment thereof in 1911, whereby it was claimed the rights of appropriators of waters were greatly enlarged. In disposing of that contention this court said: "It ought not to be necessary to remind anyone that a law of this character is not retroactive, or that it cannot operate to divest rights already vested at the time it was enacted. The amendment may possibly be effective as a Dec. '26.] HERMINGHAUS v. SOUTH. CALIFORNIA EDISON Co. 115

dedication to general public use of any riparian rights which the state, at the time it was enacted, may still have retained by virtue of its ownership of lands bordering on a stream, rights in the stream which it would in such cases have in common with owners of other abutting land. It could not affect the riparian rights of the other owners, nor the rights of any person or corporation claiming under them, nor rights previously acquired from riparian owners by prescription, nor rights acquired from the state prior to that time by appropriation under the code, in reliance upon the implied offer of the state to allow its riparian rights to be acquired in that manner, as indicated in the opinion.'' In the yet more recent case of *San Bernardino v. Riverside*, 186 Cal. 7 [198 Pac. 784], the foregoing views of this court upon this subject were restated and approved.

[14] The appellant herein, however, contends that it has gained certain definite additional rights as an appropriator of the waters of said river by virtue of the provisions of the so-called Water Commission Act of 1913 (Stats. 1913, p. 1012), and of the various later acts of the legislature supplementary to or amendatory thereof. In this claim the appellant is quite ardently supported by certain *amici curiae* asserting similar enlarged rights to the use of the waters of the various streams of this state having their sources in the high Sierras. Sections 11 and 42 of said act are the portions thereof whereupon the appellant and the *amici curiae* who agree with it rely for the asserted right to reservoir and store practically unlimited amounts of the waters of this and other rivers of this state. The portion of section 11 thereof, thus relied upon, reads as follows: "All waters flowing in any river, stream, canyon, ravine or other natural channel, excepting so far as such waters have been or are being applied to useful and beneficial purpose upon, or in so far as such waters are or may be reasonably needed for useful, and beneficial purposes upon lands riparian thereto, or otherwise appropriated, is and are hereby declared to be public waters of the State of California and subject to appropriation in accordance with the provisions of this act. If any portion of the waters of any stream shall not be put to a useful or beneficial purpose to or upon lands riparian to such stream for any continuous period of ten con- 116 HERMINGHAUS v. SOUTH. CALIFORNIA EDISON Co. [200 Cal.

secutive years after the passage of this act, such non-application shall be deemed to be conclusive presumption that the use of such portions of the waters of such stream is not needed upon said riparian lands for any useful or beneficial purpose; and such portion of the waters of any stream so non-applied, unless otherwise appropriated for a useful and beneficial purpose is hereby declared to be in the use of the state and subject to appropriation in accordance with the provisions of this act." In so far as the foregoing portion of said section of said act is concerned it would seem to have no application to the facts of the instant case, since, as we have seen, the trial court has found upon what we deem sufficient evidence that all of the waters flowing in the San Joaquin River down to and upon and over the lands of the plaintiffs herein have been and are being applied to useful and beneficial purposes upon the plaintiffs' said lands riparian thereto and have been so applied by them for more than ten consecutive years last past. It follows that such waters are not the proper subject of appropriation under the express terms of said section of said act. Section 42 of said act reads as follows: "The word 'water' in this act shall be construed as embracing the term 'or use of water'; and the term 'or use of water' in this act shall be construed as embracing the word 'water.' Whenever the terms stream, stream system, lake or other body of water or water occurs in this act, such term shall be interpreted to refer only to surface water, and to subterranean streams flowing through known and definite channels. But nothing in this act shall be construed as giving or confirming any right, or title, or interest to or in the corpus of any water; provided, that the term 'useful or beneficial purposes' as used in this act shall not be construed to mean the use in any one year of more than two and one-half acre feet of water per acre in the irrigation of uncultivated areas of land not devoted to cultivated crops." It is the contention of appellant herein and its supporting amici curiae that the concluding clause in the section above quoted expressly so limits the language of section 11 thereof above referred to in respect to the term "useful or beneficial purposes," used therein as to confine riparian owners using the waters of the rivers and streams of this state for the irrigation of uncultivated areas of their Dec. '26.] HERMINGHAUS v. SOUTH. CALIFORNIA EDISON Co. 117

said lands "not devoted to cultivated crops" to the use in any one year of not to exceed two and one-half acre-feet of water per acre of their said riparian lands. [15] The only possible theory upon which the legislature of this state could be conceded to be empowered to arrogate to itself the right to determine what are the "useful and beneficial purposes" to which lands held in private ownership shall be devoted or to which those riparian rights which are an integral part and parcel of such lands and which are already vested rights shall be limited in their use and enjoyment to the extent declared in the above-quoted concluding clauses of section 42 of said Water Commission Act is that put forward by certain of the *amici curiae* herein to the effect that such an arrogated act of legislation is justifiable as a proper exercise of the police power of the state. It may be conceded that the phrase "police power of the state" has, as to its scope and meaning been subjected to a quite severe strain of recent years in the endeavor to so expand it as to cover all sorts of legislation sought to be enacted in the asserted interest of modern progress; but we have yet to be referred to a case wherein it has been judicially so far expanded as to invest the legislative department of this state with arbitrary power to destroy vested rights in private property when such rights are being exercised and such property is being employed in the useful and in nowise harmful production of wealth, and when such use and the product thereof cannot be said or shown to be inimical to public health or morals or to the general welfare; but, on the contrary, must be conceded to be beneficial to each and all of these. The use to which the owners of lands contiguous to a river devote its soil by the aid of the waters of such river in the annual production of crops or cattle is such a use. The extent to which such riparian land owners need, and use, and are entitled to have the benefit of the flow and overflow of such waters under their vested riparian rights therein is a matter which depends upon the circumstances of each particular case; upon location, aridity, rainfall, soil porosity, responsiveness, adaptability to particular forms of production, and many other elements which render the question essentially one for judicial inquiry and determination in all cases involving the proper use of water upon both cultivated and 118 HERMINGHAUS v. SOUTH. CALIFORNIA EDISON Co. [200 Cal.

uncultivated areas. To concede that the state legislature has the right arbitrarily to fix as to the latter the amount of water which the riparian proprietor may take and use thereon would be to concede an equal power to make a like arbitrary fixation in respect to cultivated areas also, entirely regardless of the foregoing elements which are necessarily the determining factors in such fixation. To concede this would be to concede to the legislative department of the state government the arbitrary power to destroy vested rights in private property of every kind and character. In the case of *Tulare Water Co. v. State Water Com.*, 187 Cal. 533 [202 Pac. 874], this court had under consideration the extent to which the state had attempted to invest the said commission under the Water Commission Act above referred to with judicial power to determine what is and what is not water subject to appropriation under the terms of said act. In the main opinion holding that such a question would be a judicial question which said commission could be invested with no power to decide, Mr. Justice Sloane said: "What is unappropriated water is a constantly fluctuating question, depending upon the seasonal flow of the stream, the annual rainfall, the forfeiture of prior appropriations and default in the use of riparian rights. To conclude the rights of would-be appropriators by the extrajudicial and perhaps arbitrary action of a board of water commissioners would be to deprive such applicant of a valuable property right without due process of law." In a concurring opinion, Mr. Chief Justice Shaw, approving this conclusion, states in apt and terse sentences, enforced by ample citation of authority, that the effect of section 1 of article VI of the constitution is to vest in the courts the entire judicial power of the state, and that it is not within the power of the legislature to vest in any other state body any general judicial power to establish and declare the right and title to private property. If this be true it must be equally and obviously true that whatever of judicial power the legislature cannot confer upon agencies of its own creation, other than courts, it cannot arrogate to itself the right to exercise. It is to be noted as highly significant in this immediate connection that the numerous *amici curiae* who have presented briefs upon this appeal are in quite radical and vigorous disagreement as to Dec. '26.] HERMINGHAUS v. SOUTH. CALIFORNIA EDISON Co. 119

the proper basis of the appellant's asserted rights in the premises. The appellant claims the right to invoke public policy and the police powers of the state in aid of its project for the sequestration of the waters of the San Joaquin River to the full extent of such proposed sequestration, and lays claim to this right both as a riparian owner and as an appropriator of the waters of said stream. The attorney-general of this state appears as *amici curiae* herein to assert that the public interest is directly opposed to the extension of the riparian right so as to include the storage of waters, and that to accord the appellant that right to anything like the extent of its asserted claim would destroy the basis of rights on which much present development in this state depends, and render insecure the basis of rights for much future development. In this insistence the attorney-general is joined by the United States Bureau of Reclamation and by the Irrigation District Association of California, embracing a score or more of the districts of this state. The latter, however, while insisting that the right of storage of these waters should be denied to the appellant as a riparian owner, argues that such right should be allowed to it as an appropriator where such diversion will not result in injury to lower riparian owners. The James J. Stevinson Company, a corporation, and an extensive owner of lower riparian lands upon said river, appears as *amicus curiae* to protest against the exercise of the asserted rights of the appellant to the diversion and storage of the waters of said stream either as a riparian owner or as an appropriator, and to urge that the state possesses no power to enact legislation such as that attempted by the Water Commission Act which would have the effect of destroying already vested rights of riparian owners as established by this court in *Lux v. Haggin, supra*, and since repeatedly reaffirmed in the cases already cited in this opinion. Certain other public utility power companies appear by eminent counsel to uphold in its entirety the claim of the appellant. "When doctors disagree who shall decide" as to where the public interest and public welfare lie? Or who shall venture to say that these lie altogether on the side of those *quasi*-public corporations or associations, which, while fulfilling certain public utility functions, are nevertheless organized primarily for private gain, as against the lesser 120 HERMINGHAUS v. SOUTH. CALIFORNIA EDISON CO. [200 Cal.

material interests, but not less vitally important vested rights in private property, in the other scale of the balance? If the state were here assaying to uphold an effort on its part to work out impartially, unselfishly and in the interests of the whole people some general plan or system for the equitable adjustment of rights and uses in its flowing streams with a view to the conservation, development, and distribution of the dynamic forces and generative and fertilizing fructibilities of their waters, it might well be argued that public policy, public interest, and a most liberal interpretation of the police powers of the state might rightfully be invoked in support of such an effort. But can the same be properly said or claimed in a case wherein one or many privately owned and operated institutions, organized primarily for personal and private gain, and only incidentally and secondarily assuming to act in the public interest and welfare, are engaged in controversies in the courts with other private individuals or associations over the asserted and disputed property rights and interests of each of the respective parties to such controversies? We do not feel called upon in this case to so declare.

[16] It is further urged by the appellant herein, and also by certain *amici curiae* having identical aims and interests to those of the said appellant, that because of the fact that this appellant is a lessee and licensee of the United States government, which is the owner of certain of the lands through which the San Joaquin River and its tributaries flow, and on which are or will be located certain of the reservoirs and storage systems now in course of construction or contemplated by it, and because of the fact that the San Joaquin River is a navigable stream, and because the United States government in aid of commerce is in control of all navigable rivers, and because of the fact that the United States government has not only in the past expended large sums of money in the improvement of navigation along the lower reaches of said river but has in more recent years adopted the act of Congress known as the Federal Water Power Act (41 U. S. Stats. at Large, 1063), which said act was intended, among its other purposes, to promote the improvement of navigation upon and along navigable rivers; and because under the provisions of said act and in aid of Dec. '26.] HERMINGHAUS v. SOUTH. CALIFORNIA EDISON Co. 121

the administration thereof the appellant has been granted leases and licenses to enter upon, occupy, and use the said lands of the United States and to construct, operate, and maintain thereon a large portion of its contemplated system of reservoirs and storage plants for the purpose of conserving and storing the waters of said river and of thereby developing and transmitting electric power, that said appellant in so doing will be exercising and carrying forward the plans and purposes of the United States government in aid of the navigation of said river, and that in so doing it is in the rightful possession of rights and powers superior to those possessed and claimed by the plaintiffs as lower riparian owners along said stream. In aid of the foregoing assertion of the appellant herein it may be stated that the attorney-general of the United States has authorized the presentation by oral argument and by briefs as amicus curiae of the views of that department of the federal government in support of the appellant's aforesaid claims. We do not deem it necessary in this case to consider or attempt to determine what the full powers and rights of the United States government may be by virtue of the fact that it continues to be the owner of public lands along the upper reaches of navigable rivers and their tributaries beyond the point of their possible or practical navigability. It will suffice for the purposes of the present case to state that the findings of the trial court disclose that the United States government has neither expressly nor by any fair or reasonable implication undertaken to transfer to the appellant herein any right or authority to exercise whatever rights or powers the federal government may possess or be entitled to exercise in aid of navigation upon said river; nor does it appear therefrom, nor was it made to appear by any evidence in the case, that the proposed plans and projects of the appellant for the sequestration, storage, and use of the waters of said stream would be in any degree in aid of navigation. On the contrary, the evidence in the case disclosed that the appellant's proposed sequestration and storage of said waters contemplated the diversion from said river of a very large quantum of its waters; that such sequestration thereof was to continue for long and indefinite periods of time regardless of the seasonal flow of said river and that certain large and important units of its said proposed reser- 122 HERMINGHAUS v. SOUTH. CALIFORNIA EDISON Co. [200 Cal.

voir and storage systems were to be cyclic. It further appeared by both the pleadings and evidence offered by the appellant itself that it was under certain contracts with Miller & Lux Corporation, a very large lower riparian owner of said stream and user of the waters thereof for irrigation and other uses, not to return the said waters when finally released by it to said river in aid of navigation, but to deliver the same to the other party to said contracts in furtherance of its private and particular uses thereof as such riparian proprietor along said stream. Under such a state of the record we utterly fail to perceive upon what possible theory the appellant herein can predicate its asserted right as the lessee and licensee of the federal government to a superior use of the waters of said river as in aid of navigation.

[17] Finally, the appellant herein has pleaded and attempted to prove an estoppel on the part of the plaintiffs to interfere with the appellant's alleged project and plans for the construction of its proposed system of reservoirs and storage plants upon the upper reaches of said river and its tributaries arising out of their laches in the assertion of their right to the injunctive processes of the courts if such right they ever had. We do not deem it necessary in this already much extended opinion to go into the details of the appellant's averments and proofs in support of its said plea of estoppel, further than to say that the findings and conclusions of the trial court sufficiently dealt with said matter and that such findings and conclusions were fully supported by the evidence in the case. The trial court found that as to the appellant's constructive work upon the Huntington Lake reservoir and also upon the Shaver Lake reservoir and as to the amount of water impounded in each of these the plaintiffs had estopped themselves by laches from asserting the present right to enjoin the maintenance and use of these two reservoirs to the extent of the appellant's past and present utilization of the same and of the waters stored or to be stored therein; but that as to the other and as yet uncompleted and unused units of its reservoir and storage system no such estoppel had been shown. As to the former two reservoirs the trial court exempted them and the appellant's use thereof from the terms of its judgment and from its action in so doing the plaintiffs have taken no appeal. With Dec. '26.] HERMINGHAUS P. SOUTH. CALIFORNIA EDISON Co. 123

respect to the appellant's contention and attempted showing that the plaintiffs had not come into the court of equity with clean hands, we entirely agree with the trial court that there was and is no merit in said contention; nor do we deem it necessary to further elaborate upon other points urged by the appellant and by certain of the *amici curiae* in support of this appeal. The main propositions advanced herein have been given full consideration, and for the reasons educed in the course of such consideration it is ordered that the judgment herein be and the same is hereby affirmed.

Waste, C. J., Curtis, J., Seawell, J., and Sullivan, J., concurred.

SHENK, J.—I dissent. The decision in this case is important because of its effect generally upon the conservation of the waters of the state. The main opinion, it seems to me, will result in checking the progress of the state of California in conserving this most important natural resource. It unnecessarily pulls the teeth of the Water Commission Act. In order to have the beneficial use of less than one per cent of the maximum flow of the San Joaquin River on their riparian lands the plaintiffs are contending for the right to use the balance in such a way that, so far as they are concerned, over ninety-nine per cent of that flow is wasted. This is a highly unreasonable use or method of the use of water. The opinion not only supports the plaintiffs in that contention, but invalidates sections 11 and 42 of the Water Commission Act which constitute an endeavor on the part of the state to gather unto itself the waters of the state not used for a reasonably beneficial purpose and make them available for appropriation and use by the state and its inhabitants. It also supports the riparian proprietor in what may be called a vested right to an unreasonable use of water as against an appropriator. It perpetuates the doctrine to that effect announced before the adoption of the Water Commission Act, one of the purposes of which unquestionably was to abrogate the former rule. It affirms the rule laid down in *Miller & Lux v. Madera Canal etc. Co.*, 155 Cal. 59 [22 L. R. A. (N. S.) 391, 99 Pac. 502], where it was said that as between a riparian owner and an appropriator the riparian owner is not limited in his use 124 HERMINGHAUS v. SOUTH. CALIFORNIA EDISON Co. [200 Cal.

of the water by any measure of reasonableness. That case was decided in 1909 before the adoption of the Water Commission Act in 1913. In section 11 of that act the legislature has provided that all waters flowing in any river, except in so far as the same are or may be reasonably needed for useful and beneficial purposes upon lands riparian thereto or otherwise appropriated, are declared to be public waters of the state and subject to appropriation in accordance with the provisions of the act. In section 42 it is provided that the term "useful or beneficial purpose" as used in the act shall not be construed to mean the use in any one year of more than two and one-half acre-feet of water per acre in the irrigation of uncultivated areas of land not devoted to cultivated crops. These statutory provisions are in line with the declared policy of the state. In Pabst v. Finmand, 190 Cal. 124, 135 [211 Pac. 11, 15], it was said that "the declared policy of this state [is] to require the highest and greatest duty of water because of the immense importance to the state of the economical use of water," and as stated in Antioch v. Williams Irr. Dist., 188 Cal. 451, at page 461 [205 Pac. 688, 693]: "It may without exaggeration be said that the full use of the waters of rivers and mountain streams for irrigation, power, and like beneficial purposes, is absolutely necessary to the continued growth and prosperity of the state."

The rule that limits the right to the use of water to that which is reasonably necessary for beneficial purposes is now general throughout the western states and prevails in this state except as between a riparian owner and an appropriator. The rule of reason in the conservation and use of water has been applied as between appropriators (California etc. Co. v. Madera etc. Co., 167 Cal. 78 [138 Pac. 718]). It has been applied to the owners of underground water or percolating waters. (Katz v. Walkinshaw, 141 Cal. 116, 138 [99 Am. St. Rep. 35, 64 L. R. A. 236, 70 Pac. 663, 74 Pac. 766].) It has been applied to riparian owners as between themselves (Harris v. Harrison, 93 Cal. 676, 681 [29 Pac. 325]; Southern Cal. Inv. Co. v. Wilshire, 144 Cal. 68 [77 Pac. 767]; Turner v. James Canal Co., 155 Cal. 82, 95 [132 Am. St. Rep. 59, 17 Ann. Cas. 823, 22 L. R. A. (N. S.) 401, 99 Pac. 520]). Since the declaration of this court that Dec. '26.] HERMINGHAUS v. SOUTH. CALIFORNIA EDISON Co. 125

the measure of reasonableness in the use of water did not apply as between a riparian proprietor and an appropriator, the state, through the Water Commission Act, has in my judgment brought the riparian owner within the rule of reasonable use. The legislature has the right in the first instance to prescribe the standards of beneficial use and reasonable necessity that may be applied to the use of water. If those standards be unreasonable in their entirety or in any given case they may be tested in a judicial proceeding by any party aggrieved, just as police regulations with reference to the ownership of other kinds of property may be tested. (Village of Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co. (U. S.), 47 Sup. Ct. Rep. 114 [71 L. Ed. Adv. Ops. 171].) The main opinion brushes aside sections 11 and 42 as an arbitrary usurpation of power by the state resulting in interference with and destruction of vested rights. The state of Oregon, by a similar legislative enactment, has limited the right of the riparian owner to the use of that quantity of water which is actually applied to a beneficial use, in the adoption of its "Water Code" in 1909. In upholding the validity of that provision of the act the supreme court of Oregon said: "No one has any property in the water itself, but a simple usufruct. It was within the province of the legislature by the act of 1909, to define a vested right of a riparian owner, or to establish a rule as to when and under what conditions and to what extent a vested right should be deemed to be created in a riparian proprietor." (In re Hood River, 114 Or. 112 [227 Pac. 1065, 1087].) The state of Washington also has restricted the riparian owner to reasonable use when in conflict with an appropriator. In the case of Brown v. Chase, 125 Wash. 542 [217 Pac. 23], the court said that where the supply of water in a stream is more than ample for all possible riparian uses, the presumption is that the diversion by a nonriparian user will not injure any riparian right.

In 1850 the legislature provided that the common law of England should be the rule of decision in all of the courts of this state in so far as it was not inconsistent with or repugnant to the state and federal constitutions and the laws of this state. (Stats. 1850, p. 219.) This provision was codified in 1872. (Pol. Code, sec. 4468.) One of the char- 126 HERMINGHAUS v. SOUTH. CALIFORNIA EDISON Co. [200 Cal.

acteristics of the common law is that it contains within itself its own repealer, that is to say, it changes as conditions change and adapts itself to new conditions, *ex proprio vigore*. It should be applied to our conditions when our conditions are similar to those out of which the common law arose, but when the common law is not applicable, because of different conditions, it should not be applied. (1 Kinney on Irrigation, secs. 509, 510; *Motl v. Boyd* (Tex.), 286 S. W. 458.) In *Lux v. Haggin*, 69 Cal. 255 [4 Pac. 919, 10 Pac. 674], the common-law doctrine of riparian rights was applied to water rights in this state. But the conditions prevailing over forty years ago when that case was decided were far different from conditions existing at the present time when the growth and prosperity of the state are so dependent upon the proper conservation of the excess waters of its rivers by storage for irrigation and power uses. That the common law, by its own principle, adapts itself to varying conditions and modifies its rules so as to subserve the ends of present requirements was recognized and decided in 1903 in the case of *Katz v. Walkinshaw*, *supra*. Rights to the use of real property, heretofore deemed vested, have been curtailed in the interest of the public welfare. It is axiomatic that all property is owned and possessed subject to reasonable regulations under the police power. There is nothing peculiar to a riparian right, which is part and parcel of land itself, that should exclude it from proper limitations in the interest of the people of the state. It is difficult to conceive of a question more intimately connected with the present and future industrial and economic development of the state than the conservation of the excess waters of its great rivers. The immediate question involved in this case is: How may the waters in excess of the reasonable requirements of the riparian owners be taken and put to a beneficial use? This question the state has endeavored to solve, at least in its initiatory stage, by the adoption of the Water Commission Act.

Citation of authority would seem to be unnecessary to support the proposition that no one may acquire a vested right to waste water in any form. That precise statement was made in the case of *Eden Irr. Co. v. District Court*, 61 Utah, 103 [211 Pac. 957], in the following language: "Let Dec. '26.] HERMINGHAUS v. SOUTH. CALIFORNIA EDISON Co. 127.

it be remembered that no one can acquire a vested right to waste water in any form. In this arid country water is life and may not be wasted. In this connection it is of the utmost importance to remember that no one can acquire an absolute title to water as he can to other property. A person having absolute title to property generally may ordinarily waste it, destroy it, or permit it to go to decay and become utterly useless at his pleasure. This he may not do with water." Abundant authority to the same effect could be cited. The asserted right of a riparian owner in this state to have the waters of a river flow over or past his land regardless of the reasonableness of the use or the benefit that such use may be to him should therefore not be confirmed, especially when such use results in a needless waste and the deprivation of the rights of the state and of those who would use such waters for beneficial purposes under the authority of the state. The case of *Tulare Water Co. v. State Water Com.*, 187 Cal. 533 [202 Pac. 874], cited in the main opinion in support of the holding that sections 11 and 42 are void, did not purport to decide that the legislature was without power to safeguard the waters of the state from wastefulness and dissipation by the adoption of proper regulations. What that case did decide was that it was not competent for the legislature to confer upon the State Water Commission arbitrary power to refuse applications to appropriate waters in conformity with the provisions of the act. The power there sought to be exercised by the commission, as pointed out in the concurring opinion, was the exercise of a judicial function which it was not competent for the legislature to confer upon the commission. The sections of the act nullified by the main opinion do not attempt to confer judicial power on the commission. They merely declare the standards of beneficial use to be adhered to unless set aside when subjected to proper judicial test, and there is nothing in this case to indicate that those standards are unreasonable.

As to the particular facts in this case: The appellant is both a riparian owner and an appropriator on the upper reaches of the San Joaquin River. The plaintiffs are the owners of some 18,000 acres of land bordering on the river below. This tract is an uncultivated area of grazing land not devoted to cultivated crops. In the spring and early summer it is inundated by the waters of the river to such an 128 HERMINGHAUS v. SOUTH. CALIFORNIA EDISON Co. [200 Cal.

extent that as such waters flow down the valley they resemble a moving lake. During that season of the year the flow amounts to from 10,000 to 20,000 cubic feet of water per second. The court found that a constant flow of 180 cubic feet per second from April 1st to October 1st of each year would irrigate the lands of the plaintiffs if the same were prepared for *intensive cultivation*. "The amount of water sufficient to cover the ground two and one-half feet deep is generally considered plenty if beneficially used; therefore, one second foot should, it has been said, be sufficient to irrigate one hundred to two hundred acres." (Wiel on Water Rights, 3d ed., p. 522, citing *Hough v. Porter*, 51 Or. 318 [95 Pac. 732, 98 Pac. 1083, 102 Pac. 728].) The amount found by the court to be sufficient was, therefore, no more and, in fact, was less than the statute declares may be used for beneficial purposes. In the face of that finding and notwithstanding its admitted support in the evidence the opinion proceeds to declare said sections of the statute nugatory.

The plaintiffs do not pretend to use or to be able to use the great volume of water that flows by their land on to San Francisco Bay in the sense that the term "use of water" is ordinarily employed, namely, for the purpose of sinking into or moistening the soil of their lands. The use they demand is to employ this tremendous flow as a booster or a means of conveyance or of transportation to lift the very small percentage of the flow so useful to them to and over their pasture lands. A more extravagant or wasteful use of water could not well be imagined. Two and one-half acre-feet of water is more than annually sinks into their lands. The balance is excess as to them and so far as they are concerned passes on to the sea and is utterly wasted. This waste is not only contrary to the statutory regulation but it works an injustice to the state, which is endeavoring to conserve such waters for useful and beneficial uses by appropriators under the laws of the state.

The main opinion stresses the fact that the court found that the proposed use of the waters of the river by the appellant was and is unreasonable as against the plaintiffs and that the use by the plaintiffs of the entire flow of the river was necessary to the enjoyment of their riparian right, Dec. '26.] HERMINGHAUS v. SOUTH. CALIFORNIA EDISON Co. 129

and that therefore this court is bound by those findings. It may be conceded that the question of reasonableness is usually one of fact for the determination of the trial court, but it is also true that when the facts found in the light of the evidence disclose a use or a method of use of water that is so excessive and wasteful as to be palpably unreasonable, a question of law is then presented. (40 Cyc. 563.) The conclusion of the trial court that the storage plans and enterprise of the appellant will result in an unreasonable use of the waters of the river and the further conclusion that the natural flow of the river is necessary for the plaintiffs' purposes are predicated upon the continuance of the present status. Claim for the continuance of that status on the part of the plaintiffs is so unreasonable as to render their position inequitable and to justify the denial of the absolute injunction granted in this case. It would seem that the impounding of the waters by the appellant as proposed could only result in an equalization of the flow of the river with a constant release of sufficient water to develop the contiguous valley to a high state of cultivation and to the ultimate benefit of plaintiffs' lands. In fact, it has been said as to the overflow waters in this locality in the spring and early summer season that "at such times the San Joaquin river itself is carrying an abundance of water. The excess waters are not needed and are not used and are rather a detriment than a benefit to the land owners." (*Miller & Lux v. Enterprise etc. Co.*, 169 Cal. 415, 420 [147 Pac. 567, 569].)

If it be assumed that the plaintiffs would suffer detriment in being deprived of the use of such excess waters, wasteful though it be, and if it be assumed that it would not be necessary to reduce that detriment to *dammum absque injuria*, still the absolute injunction should not be granted. Such detriment would seem to be no more than the cost to the plaintiffs of conforming to a sane program of conservation by the construction of necessary diversion work. The court found that such preparation would entail a large expenditure of money, but it did not find the amount that would be required. The cause should at least be remanded for the purpose of ascertaining the amount of that expenditure. In other words, whatever present detriment might accrue to the plaintiffs by reason of being deprived of the lifting

200 Cal.—9 130 HERMINGHAUS v. SOUTH. CALIFORNIA EDISON Co. [200 Cal.

facilities afforded by the flow in excess of what they reasonably need should be ascertained. The fact that the appellant possesses the power of eminent domain is not a justification for the injunction as ordered. That the appellant has that right supports the view that the trial court in this proceeding and in the injunction order itself could adequately provide for compensation to the plaintiffs for the damage suffered, if any. In such a case when "the court can arrive in terms of money at the loss which plaintiff has sustained, an absolute injunction should not be granted, but an injunction conditional merely upon the failure of the defendant to make good the damage which results from its work. . . . The defendant in effect would be held to be damaging private property without just compensation first made to the owner, and, failing to make such compensation, should be enjoined from further damage. For, as was said by this court in *Montecito Valley v. Santa Barbara*, 144 Cal. 587 [77 Pac. 1113], in a case similar to this, 'a prohibitory injunction should only be granted if any and all other forms of relief should be found inadequate.'" (*Newport v. Temescal Water Co.*, 149 Cal. 531 [6 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1098, 87 Pac. 372].) In a condemnation proceeding the court could arrive in terms of money at the loss which the plaintiffs would sustain and no good reason appears why it may not do so in this proceeding.

I am of the opinion that sections 11 and 42 of the Water Commission Act constitute valid regulations in the interest of the conservation of the waters of the state; that as between a riparian owner and an appropriator of water the rule of reasonable use should apply to the one the same as to the other; that the Water Commission Act has properly established that rule and that this court should hold in harmony with the legislative declaration when such declaration, as here, appears to be just and reasonable in recognition of the vested riparian right; that the appellant as an appropriator of water has the right of storage and should have its reasonable exercise of that right balanced only against the reasonable exercise by the plaintiffs of their riparian right; that the plaintiffs should not be upheld in their insistence that the present wasteful use or method of use of waters of the river shall continue, and that in any event the method Dec. '26.] HERMINGHAUS v. SOUTH. CALIFORNIA EDISON Co. 131

of procedure suggested in *Newport v. Temescal Water Co., supra*, at page 538, should be adopted, viz., that of requiring the trial court in the exercise of the equity power it possesses to find the damage, if any, suffered by the plaintiffs and under the prayer of the appellant for general relief make the "injunction conditional merely upon the failure of the defendant to make good the damage." In that way the extensive project undertaken by the appellant need not be stopped, the preference and other lawful rights of the plaintiffs would be protected, and the state be not impeded in working out its highly important task of conserving the waters of the state for this and coming generations. That such is the duty of the state can admit of no doubt. Its purpose to that end is commended and urged by the attorney-general of the United States, the attorney-general of California, the attorney for the state division of water rights, and counsel for numerous irrigation districts appearing as *amici curiae* herein. It seems to me that the appropriate opportunity to interpret the laws of the state in harmony with present day requirements as contemplated by the statute is presented in the case at bar.

[L. A. No. 9141. In Bank.—December 24, 1926.]

In the Matter of the Estate of CLARK PARKER, Deceased.
HENRY A. STEARNS et al., Appellants, v. LEON
M. ABBOTT, as Executor, etc., Respondent.

[1] ESTATES OF DECEASED PERSONS—EXECUTORS, ADMINISTRATORS,
AND TESTAMENTARY TRUSTEES—EMPLOYMENT OF ATTORNEY—COMPENSATION.—An executor, administrator, or testamentary trustee who is himself an attorney may properly employ another attorney to render the necessary legal services for the estate, and he may be entitled to an allowance out of the estate for the value of such legal services; but if the executor, administrator, or testamentary trustee, being himself a practicing attorney, elects to act as his own attorney in the performance of the legal services incident to the administration of the estate, the general rule is that he will not be entitled to an allowance against the estate for his professional services, in the absence of some statutory provision entitling him thereto.

[2] ID.—ATTORNEY AS EXECUTOR—EMPLOYMENT OF OWN FIRM—RULE.
An executor or administrator who is himself a lawyer may be allowed a credit for fees to be paid a law firm of which he is a member, if it was agreed between him and his partners that he was not to share in the moneys to be received by the firm for its services; but if he was to participate in the compensation to be earned by his firm, the same principles and policies which are opposed to the allowance of additional compensation to an executor or administrator for legal services rendered by him individually as an attorney at law are equally opposed to an allowance of compensation to his law firm.

[3] ID.—ABSENCE OF AGREEMENT—PRESUMPTIONS.—In the absence from the record of any express agreement between an attorney acting as executor of an estate and his law partners acting as attorneys for the executor as to whether the executor was or was not to participate in the compensation to be received by his firm for its legal services, the presumption is that the executor was to share the compensation with his partners, and, under such circumstances, an order allowing such firm of lawyers compensation for extra legal services is erroneous.

2. See 11 Cal. Jur. 1181. Dec. 1926.] ESTATE OF PARKER. 133

[4] Id.—SECTION 1618, CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE.—The amendment of 1925 to section 1618 of the Code of Civil Procedure removing the limit upon the amount which may be allowed an executor or administrator as additional compensation for an extraordinary service performed by him cannot be relied upon to sustain an order for such compensation made prior to said amendment, as this would give the amendment a retroactive effect.

[5] Id.—CHARACTER OF SERVICES.—The study by an executor and his counsel of the stock market in order to be able to make an advantageous sale of shares of stock belonging to the estate is not a professional service for which a lawyer may make a charge payable out of the estate, but is the performance of the ordinary duty of the executor in selling the property of his testator.

APPEAL from an order of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County settling the final account of an executor and allowing extra compensation to the attorneys for the executor. Frank R. Willis, Judge. Reversed.

The facts are stated in the opinion of the court.

Merriam, Rinehart & Merriam for Appellants.

Bates, Nay, Abbott & Dane, Henry O. Wheeler and Henry O. Wackerbarth for Respondent.

FINLAYSON, J.—Three residuary legatees under the will of Clark Parker, deceased, have appealed from that part of an order settling the executor's final account which allows $40,000 as extra compensation to the attorneys for extraordinary services alleged to have been rendered by them in the probate proceedings.

The respondent, Leon M. Abbott, is the executor of the will, appointed as such by the superior court for Los Angeles County. Mr. Abbott is a member of the law firm of Bates, Nay, Abbott & Dane, a firm of attorneys practicing law in the state of Massachusetts with offices in the city of Boston.

4. See 23 Cal. Jur. 629. 134 ESTATE OF PARKER. [200 Cal.
He employed this firm and two Los Angeles lawyers, Messrs. Henry O. Wheeler and Henry O. Wackerbarth, to act as his attorneys in the performance of all the legal services incident to the probate proceedings. When the estate was ready for distribution respondent filed his final account, report, and petition for distribution. In the account he claimed credit for all of the statutory commissions and all of the extra compensation to which he possibly could be entitled as executor under the statute as it then read; he also claimed a credit for all of the statutory commissions to which his attorneys could be entitled, and an additional sum as extra compensation to them for extraordinary legal services alleged to have been performed by them. The specific amounts for which he thus claimed credit in his final account are: (1) $3,147.13, the regular commissions due him under section 1618 of the Code of Civil Procedure for ordinary executorial services; (2) $1,573.57 (one-half of the regular commissions) as extra compensation for extraordinary services performed by him as executor; (3) $3,147.13, the regular attorneys' commissions allowable under sections 1618 and 1619 for legal services rendered in conducting the ordinary probate proceedings; and (4) $50,000 as further compensation to the attorneys for extraordinary legal services alleged to have been performed by them. In due time the residuary legatees who have taken this appeal appeared in the court below and objected to the allowance of any amount for extraordinary legal services. Thereafter the court made an order settling respondent's final account. The order allows the items of $3,147.13 and $1,573.57 as credits, respectively, for respondent's regular commissions and extra compensation for extraordinary services performed by him as executor, the item of $3,147.13 as attorneys' fees for the services of the attorneys in conducting the ordinary probate proceedings, and the sum of $40,000 as further compensation to the attorneys for extraordinary legal services performed by them. Included in this item of $40,000 is an undetermined amount representing the share of respondent's law firm in the extra compensation for extraordinary services. That is to say, the amounts due respectively to respondent's law firm and to the two local attorneys for such extraordinary services are not segregated but are lumped in one sum. It is from the al- Dec. 1926.] ESTATE OF PARKER. 135

lowance of this credit of $40,000 that this appeal is prosecuted.

At all the times when respondent performed his services as executor, and, indeed, at the time when the court made its order settling the final account and decreeing distribution, section 1618 of the Code of Civil Procedure provided that an executor, when no compensation is provided by the will or he renounces all claims thereto, shall be allowed, as compensation for his ordinary services, commissions at certain specified rates upon the amount of the estate accounted for by him, and that "such further allowance may be made as the court may deem just and reasonable for any extraordinary service," but that the total amount which the court may allow for extraordinary executorial services shall not exceed one-half the amount of commissions allowed the executor for his ordinary services. By section 1619 it is provided that attorneys for executors and administrators shall be allowed as fees for conducting the ordinary probate proceedings the same commissions that are allowed to executors and administrators under section 1618, and that for any "extraordinary services" rendered by the attorneys, such as sales or mortgages of real estate and other specifically designated kinds of professional services, "such further allowance may be made as the court may deem just and reasonable." By an amendment which became effective July 24, 1925 (Stats. 1925, p. 624)—two and one-half months after the entry of the order settling the final account and decreeing distribution—section 1618 was so amended that, as it now reads, no limitation is placed upon the amount of the extra compensation which may be allowed an executor for his extraordinary services.

[1] An executor, administrator, or testamentary trustee who is himself an attorney at law may properly employ another attorney to render the necessary legal services for the estate, and he may be entitled to an allowance out of the estate for the value of such legal services. (Estate of Graham, 187 Cal. 222 [18 A. L. R. 631, 201 Pac. 456].) But if the executor, administrator, or testamentary trustee, being himself a practicing lawyer, elects to act as his own attorney in the performance of the legal services incident to the administration of the estate, the general rule is that he will 136 ESTATE OF PARKER. [200 Cal.
not be entitled to an allowance against the estate for his professional services, in the absence of some statutory provision entitling him thereto. (Collier v. Munn, 41 N. Y. 143; Lent v. Howard, 89 N. Y. 170; Parker v. Day, 155 N. Y. 383 [49 N. E. 1046]; In re Wallach, 164 App. Div. 600 [150 N. Y. Supp. 302], affirmed in 215 N. Y. 622 [109 N. E. 1094]; Willard v. Bassett, 27 Ill. 38 [79 Am. Dec. 393]; Hough v. Harvey, 71 Ill. 72; Whittemore v. Coleman, 239 Ill. 450 [88 N. E. 228]; Taylor v. Wright, 93 Ind. 121; Doss v. Stevens, 13 Colo. App. 535 [59 Pac. 67]; Slusher v. Weller, 151 Ky. 203 [151 S. W. 684]; Holding v. Allen, 150 Tenn. 669 [36 A. L. R. 743, 266 S. W. 772]; notes to Estate of Graham, supra, in 18 A. L. R., p. 635 et seq., and notes to Holding v. Allen, supra, in 36 A. L. R., p. 748 et seq. See, also, Estate of Runyon, 125 Cal. 195, 197, 198 [57 Pac. 783], where the principle enunciated in the above cases is recognized with approval.) This rule is supported by the weight of authority (Holding v. Allen, supra); and though there is considerable apparent and perhaps real conflict of authority upon the subject (24 C. J., p. 108), we deem it a sound and wholesome doctrine, founded upon reasons of public policy. In Estate of Graham, supra, this court says: "If he [the administrator] did perform such services which were not in the line of his duty as administrator, he might not be permitted to receive compensation, but the reason would be one of public policy forbidding him to be his own employer." In Stanes v. Parker, 9 Beav. 385 [50 Eng. Reprint, 392], it was said: "The safety of the public has been justly thought to require the rule now clearly established, that, although a trustee, being a solicitor, may appoint another solicitor to execute the professional business relating to the trust, yet if he does it himself, he shall not be allowed to charge for his professional services." See, also, In re Bank of Niagara, 6 Paige (N. Y.), 213, 215. In Broughton v. Broughton, 5 De Gex, M. & G. 160 [43 Eng. Reprint, 831], the Lord Chancellor said: "The rule applicable to the subject has been treated at the Bar as if it were sufficiently enunciated by saying that a trustee shall not be able to make a profit of his trust, but that is not stating it so widely as it ought to be stated. The rule really is, that no one who has a duty to perform shall place himself in a Dec. 1926.] ESTATE OF PARKER. 137

situation to have his interests conflicting with that duty; and a case for the application of the rule is that of a trustee himself doing acts which he might employ others to perform, and taking payment in some way for doing them. As the trustee might make the payment to others, this Court says he shall not make it to himself; and it says the same in the case of agents, where they may employ others under them. The good sense of the rule is obvious, because it is one of the duties of a trustee to take care that no improper charges are made by persons employed for the estate. It has been often argued that a sufficient check is afforded by the power of taxing the charges, but the answer to this is that that check is not enough, and the creator of the trust has a right to have that, and also the check of the trustee. The result therefore is, that no person in whom fiduciary duties are vested shall make a profit of them by employing himself, because in doing this he cannot perform one part of his trust, namely, that of seeing that no improper charges are made. The general rule applies to a solicitor acting as a trustee."

[2] An executor or administrator who is himself a lawyer may be allowed a credit for fees to be paid a law firm of which he is a member, if it was agreed between him and his partners that he is not to share in the moneys to be received by the firm for its services. (Estate of Schillaber, 1 Cof. Prob. Dec. 101.) But if he is to participate in the compensation to be earned by his firm, then the same principles and policies which are opposed to the allowance of additional compensation to an executor or administrator for legal services rendered by him individually as an attorney at law are equally opposed to the allowance of compensation to his law firm. (Taylor v. Wright, supra; Liles' Succession, 24 La. Ann. 490; Needham v. Needham, 34 Idaho, 193 [200 Pac. 346]; Collins v. Carey, 2 Beav. 128 [48 Eng. Reprint, 1128]; Christopher v. White, 10 Beav. 523 [50 Eng. Reprint, 683]; Lyon v. Baker, 5 De Gex & S. 622 [64 Eng. Reprint, 1271].) As was said by the Indiana supreme court in Taylor v. Wright, supra: "To hold that an executor or administrator, while he may not be compensated out of the estate for his individual legal services, can share with a partner compensation for legal services rendered the estate 138 ESTATE OF PARKER. [200 Cal.
by the firm, would be suggesting an easy method for evading the law." [3] The record before us is silent as to the existence of any express agreement between respondent and his partners as to whether he was or was not to participate in the compensation to be received by his firm for its legal services. In the absence of any such showing the presumption is that respondent was to share the compensation with his partners. (Needham v. Needham, supra; Liles' Succession, supra.)

From the foregoing it follows that the court erred in allowing the item of $40,000, unless justification therefor may be found in some provision of the statute. Section 1618 of the Code of Civil Procedure, as we have seen, provided, at the time of the rendition of the professional services, that an executor shall be allowed certain specified commissions for his ordinary services, and that, for any extraordinary service performed by him as executor, such "further allowance may be made as the court may deem just and reasonable," not exceeding one-half of the commissions allowable for his ordinary executorial services. Cases are to be found in some jurisdictions which hold that where it is provided by statute that executors or administrators may be allowed extra compensation for extraordinary services, an executor or administrator who, being an attorney, performed legal services for the estate may be allowed, in addition to the usual commissions attached to his office, a further compensation for his legal services. (Sloan v. Duffy, 117 Wis. 480 [94 N. W. 342]. See, also, In re Wilson's Estate, 83 Neb. 252 [119 N. W. 522], and Davidson v. Story, 106 Ga. 799 [32 S. E. 867].) In Sloan v. Duffy, supra, the Wisconsin court holds that legal services performed by an executor who is an attorney are "extraordinary services" within the meaning of a statute providing that for all "extraordinary services" rendered by an executor the court shall make such an allowance over and above the statutory fees as might be adjudged reasonable. The theory underlying these cases, tacitly assumed rather than expressed, seems to be this: The only reason for ever holding that a lawyer-executor may not charge the estate for legal services rendered by him is that, if the statute makes no provision for extra compensation, he would, in effect, be charging double commissions, or com- Dec. 1926.] ESTATE OF PARKER. 139

pensation over and above the statutory fees to which he is entitled as an executor, if he were to charge the estate for legal services rendered by him in his professional capacity. This theory completely ignores the fact that the fundamental basis for the rule which we have been considering is one of public policy—that, as was said by the Lord Chancellor in Broughton v. Broughton, supra, it is a rule which is grounded upon the principle that a trustee shall not "place himself in a situation to have his interests conflicting with" his duty as a fiduciary. The law, for wise reasons, forbids a person occupying a fiduciary relation to assume a position which might possibly be adverse to his duties. It is against public policy to permit such a person to be placed where he might be tempted to betray his trust. (Western States Life Ins. Co. v. Lockwood, 166 Cal. 190, 191 [135 Pac. 496]; Sims v. Petaluma Gas Light Co., 131 Cal. 659 [63 Pac. 1011]; Pacific Vinegar etc. Works v. Smith, 145 Cal. 365 [104 Am. St. Rep. 42, 78 Pac. 550].) "When one undertakes to deal with himself in different capacities—individual and representative—there is a manifest hostility in the position he occupies. His duty calls upon him to act for the best interests of his principal; his self-interest prompts him to make the best bargain for himself. Humanity is so constituted that when these conflicting interests arise the temptation is usually too great to be overcome; and duty is sacrificed to interest." (Western States Life Ins. Co. v. Lockwood, supra.) It clearly is the duty of every executor, when engaging counsel to render professional services for the estate, to employ the best legal talent available for the stipulated compensation. But he would place himself in a position where there would be a clash between his own personal interest and his duty to employ the ablest counsel obtainable for the agreed compensation if, being himself a lawyer, he should undertake to perform that service himself with the intention of charging the estate therefor, or if, being a member of a law firm and sharing in the fee to be earned, he should employ his firm to render the necessary professional services. Again, it is the duty of every executor to oppose any charge which the attorney or attorneys employed by him might make against the estate for extraordinary legal services, if there be no substantial ground for the claim that 140 ESTATE OF PARKER. [200 Cal.
the services were indeed extraordinary. But his personal interest would conflict with this duty if the services were rendered by his own law firm and he is to share in the earnings. These examples will suffice to show how an executor might be tempted to look with too friendly an eye upon improper claims for legal services if we were to relax the salutary rule announced in such cases as Collier v. Munn, supra, merely because our code provides that an executor may be allowed extra compensation for extraordinary service. We are not to be understood as intimating that this respondent, in asking an allowance for extraordinary legal services performed by his law firm and the two local attorneys, was not acting in good faith, or that no extraordinary legal services were in fact performed by the attorneys. We have no reason to suspect bad faith in this case, and the examples which we have instanced of a possible conflict of duty with personal interest have been cited by us solely for the purpose of showing why it is that public policy should be regarded as the basic reason for the general rule that a lawyer-executor may not charge the estate for his own or his firm's professional services.

But even if public policy had nothing whatever to do with the rule, and even if it should be held that, where the statute allows an executor extra compensation for his extraordinary services, a lawyer-executor may be allowed extra compensation for extraordinary legal services performed by him or by his law firm, nevertheless respondent still would fail to uphold the propriety of the credit for $40,000. As we already have stated, a portion of that sum—how much does not appear—represents the share claimed by respondent's law firm for its part in the extraordinary legal services; and the balance, whatever it may be, represents the share of the two local attorneys for their part in such services. If, therefore, this item of $40,000 were allowed, then respondent, as one who is entitled to participate in the profits earned by his law firm, would receive some part of this extra compensation. But in the item of $1,573.57 allowed him as extra compensation over and above his commissions for ordinary executorial duties, he already has been allowed all of the extra compensation to which, as executor, he possibly can be entitled under section 1618 as it read at the time when Dec. 1926.]                                                                                          ESTATE OF PARKER.                                                                                          141

the services were rendered. It follows, therefore, that any allowance of compensation to his law firm for extraordinary legal services, or even for ordinary legal services, must inevitably result in respondent receiving more than was allowable to him as executor under section 1618 prior to its amendment in 1925. Therefore, even if we were to give to that code section the same effect which the Wisconsin court in *Sloan v. Duffy, supra*, gave to a similar statutory provision, the allowance of this item of $40,000 would be improper nevertheless.

[4] Respondent seeks to avoid this conclusion by arguing that his right to extra compensation must be measured by section 1618 as it now reads, and that, since that section no longer places a limit upon the amount which may be allowed an executor or administrator as additional compensation for an extraordinary service performed by him, the extra compensation which already has been allowed respondent for his extraordinary services as executor presents no obstacle to an allowance of the item of $40,000, if the reasoning of the Wisconsin case be followed. Respondent takes the position that if, subsequent to a judgment appealed from and prior to a decision by the appellate court, there be an alteration or repeal of the law applicable to the rights of the parties, the appeal must be decided according to the then existing law—citing *United States v. Schooner Peggy, 5 U. S. (Cranch) 102 [2 L. Ed. 49, see, also, Rose's U. S. Notes], and a number of other analogous cases. The cases cited by respondent are not applicable to the situation here presented, and there is no merit in his contention. A decision on the rights of the parties to this appeal in accord with the provisions of section 1618 as amended in 1925 would give to that amendment a retroactive effect. But that effect we may not give for the reason that no part of the Code of Civil Procedure "is retroactive unless expressly so declared." (Code Civ. Proc., sec. 3; *Central Pac. R. R. Co. v. Shackelford, 63 Cal. 264; Estate of Frees, 187 Cal. 155 [201 Pac. 112].*) The amendment in question, to the extent that it removes all limitation upon the amount which may be allowed to executors and administrators as extra compensation for extraordinary services performed by them, has the effect of imposing new and additional liabilities upon estates in 142 ESTATE OF PARKER. [200 Cal.
probate. A statute will not be given a retroactive construction by which it will impose liabilities not existing at the time of its passage. "Laws which create new obligations, or impose new duties, or exact new penalties because of past transactions, have been universally reprobated by civil and common law writers, and it is to be presumed that no statute is intended to have such effect unless the contrary clearly appears." (Pignaz v. Burnell, 119 Cal. 160 [51 Pac. 48].) In Estate of Daly, 180 App. Div. 307 [167 N. Y. Supp. 229], affirmed without opinion in 223 N. Y. 671 [119 N. E. 1037], it is held that an amendment to section 2753 of the New York Code of Civil Procedure requiring the surrogate to allow to an executor, who is also an attorney and who has rendered legal services in connection with his executorial duties, reasonable compensation for those services, is not retroactive so as to permit an allowance for services rendered prior to the amendment.

Though the part of the order appealed from must be reversed for the reason that it allows the executor, indirectly, compensation which should not be charged against the estate, it does not necessarily follow that the local attorneys, Messrs. Henry O. Wheeler and Henry O. Wackerbarth, are not entitled to extra compensation for any extraordinary legal services which they may have performed.

[5] In his petition for an allowance of extra compensation for the attorneys, respondent describes many different kinds of services, a number of which unquestionably cannot be classified as extraordinary legal services. Take one example, for illustration: It is alleged that respondent and his counsel studied the stock market in order to be able to make an advantageous sale of certain shares of stock belonging to the estate. This is not a professional service for which a lawyer may make a charge payable out of the estate. It is but the performance of an ordinary duty of the executor in selling the property of his testator. The order from which the appeal was taken does not show what services were made the basis for the allowance of the $40,000. From the record before us it is not possible to determine what part, if any, of the $40,000 was allowed for services which are not extraordinary legal services within the meaning of section 1619 of the code. That this situation, in the event of a Dec. 1926.] CITY OF SACRAMENTO v. GODDARD. 143

second appeal, may not again arise, the lower court, on the going down of the *remittitur*, should, if counsel be so advised, entertain a motion to strike from the petition all references to services which are not "extraordinary" legal services within the meaning of section 1619; or, as an alternative, that court, on the retrial of the issues involving the claim of the two local attorneys for extra compensation, should expressly find, either by appropriate recitals in the order or otherwise, the precise services performed by the local attorneys, if any, which it finds to be extraordinary.

The part of the order appealed from is reversed, and the matter is remanded to the lower court for a new trial, in accordance with this opinion, upon the issues presented by respondent's petition for extra compensation to the attorneys.

APPLICATION for Writ of Mandate to compel the Mayor of Sacramento to attest and sign certain municipal public improvement bonds. Writ granted.

The facts are stated in the opinion of the court.

R. L. Shinn for Petitioner.

Hinsdale & Otis and Devlin & Devlin for Respondent.

WASTE, C. J.—The City of Sacramento prays for a peremptory writ of mandate directing the respondent, as mayor of the city, to attest and sign certain bonds, issuance of which, it is alleged, was duly authorized by action of the voters. The respondent has demurred to the petition, and raises the question whether or not the bonds were authorized by the requisite number of electors voting therefor.

At a special election regularly called and held for that purpose on the twenty-ninth day of June, 1926, twelve different propositions for the issuance of municipal public improvement bonds, separately designated and stated on the ballots, were submitted to the electors of the City of Sacramento. Among them was one designated as Proposition No. 4, for the issuance of bonds in the sum of $350,000, to provide for the installation of additional filter-beds in the filtration plant of the city, and the purchase and installation of additional equipment for the plant which is a part of the city's water supply system. A total of 9,890 votes were cast at the election. 9,412 votes were cast on Proposition No. 4, 6,298 of which were for the bonds and 3,114 in opposition thereto. It thus appears that 23 more than two-thirds of those voting on Proposition No. 4, but 296 less than two-thirds of all those voting at the election, cast their votes in favor of the bonds for the filtration plant. All the proceedings leading up to and including the election were regular, Dec. 1926.] CITY OF SACRAMENTO v. GODDARD. 145

but respondent refused to attest the bonds upon the ground, and for the reason, that they had not been authorized by two-thirds of all the votes cast at the election.

[1] Section 18 of article XI of the constitution prohibits a city from incurring a bonded indebtedness, such as that here sought, "without the assent of two-thirds of the qualified electors thereof, voting at an election to be held for that purpose." So far as this provision governs, it is not directly provided that more than one purpose may be submitted at the same election, but such submission is not prohibited. The legislature, however, by a subsequent enactment (Stats. 1901, p. 27), authorized the submission of more than one proposition or purpose at the same election, but provided that it shall "require the votes of two-thirds of all the voters voting at such special election to authorize the issuance of the bonds." It is conceded here that, if the sufficiency of the vote on the filtration bond issue is to be determined in accordance with the provisions of the statute, Proposition No. 4 did not carry. [2] Petitioner, however, relies upon a provision of the Sacramento City charter to support its contention that the bonds received the favorable vote of a sufficient number of the electors. This provision appears to be peculiar to the Sacramento charter, for which reason the question presented in this case is one *de novo*, and is not determined by any of the former rulings of this court. The language of the charter is as follows: "Section 92: The City Council may contract bonded indebtedness as follows: It shall, by order duly passed by Ayes and Noes, recorded in its journal of proceedings, specify the particular purpose for which the indebtedness is to be created, and the amount of bonds which it is proposed to issue . . . The ballot shall be printed 'For the Issue of Bonds. Yes.' 'For the Issue of Bonds. No.' If two-thirds of the electors of the City so voting at such election shall vote in favor of issuing bonds, and not otherwise, the City Council may proceed to issue the amount of bonds specified." It is the contention of the petitioner that the use of the words "so voting" (italicized by us) is significant. It claims that the framers of the charter had in mind the statute of 1901, requiring all the votes cast at such an election to be determinative of the requisite number for each particular purpose, and sought to obvi-

200 Cal.—10 146 CITY OF SACRAMENTO v. GODDARD. [200 Cal.

ate the statutory restriction by using the words "so voting," thereby making the vote on each proposition the basis of determining whether or not such proposition "so voted" upon was legally assented to by the electors of the city. If that were the purpose, and it seems only reasonable to believe that it was, it was but the forerunner of the action of the voters generally throughout the state at the last general election. The section of the constitution (supra) was amended to provide that whenever two or more propositions for incurring any indebtedness or liability are submitted at the same election to the electors of any city, or other specified political subdivision, the votes cast for and against each proposition shall be counted separately, and when two-thirds of the qualified electors, voting on any one of such propositions, vote in favor thereof, such proposition shall be deemed adopted.

We are of the view that the words "so voting," as used in the Sacramento charter, were intended to, and do, relate back to those electors who vote "Yes" or "No" on any particular bond proposition, and that if two-thirds of the electors of the city voting on any separate proposition vote in favor thereof, as was done in the instant case, the proposition is carried. No cases have been called to our attention in which the precise question has had judicial consideration, but an interesting discussion of the subject will be found in *Montgomery County Fiscal Court v. Trimble*, 104 Ky. 629 [42 L. R. A. 738, 47 S. W. 773].

[1] ESTATES OF DECEASED PERSONS — PETITION FOR REVOCATION OF PROBATE OF WILL—EVIDENCE.—In this proceeding for the revocation of the probate of a will, it is held that the trial court exercised a reasonable control over the examination of witnesses, and that although certain rulings excluding evidence, standing alone, might properly be held erroneous, when considered in the light of the evidence elsewhere admitted they were not prejudicial.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County. Charles Monroe, Judge. Affirmed.

The facts are stated in the opinion of the court.

Lewis & Fleming and John M. Martin for Appellants.

O'Melveny, Millikin, Tuller & Macneil, Lovett & Hervey and Mott & Vallee for Respondents.

SHENK, J.—This is an appeal from a judgment of the superior court in and for the county of Los Angeles denying and dismissing the petition of the appellants for the revocation of the probate of the will of Alma Haupt, deceased.

The petition contained four counts. In substance it was alleged that the testatrix was without testamentary capacity at the time the will was executed; that its execution was procured by fraud and undue influence; that the testatrix did not know the contents of the will at the time of its execution, and that the will was not lawfully witnessed. After hearing the evidence on behalf of the appellants the trial court dismissed the petition without submitting the issues involved therein to the jury and the judgment was entered in accordance therewith.

The decedent died in the county of Los Angeles on May 25, 1922, leaving as her only heirs at law, a son, William Frederick Haupt, a daughter, Norma Haupt, and the appellants, who are the minor children of a predeceased son. By the terms of her will, bearing date April 17, 1922, the testatrix made certain specific bequests and devised and bequeathed the remainder of her estate to the respondent bank in trust for certain specified purposes. The seventh clause of said will expressly declared that the testatrix purposely omitted to make provision therein for the appellants.

[1] The first contention advanced by the appellants is that: "The trial court erred in its refusal to admit competent evidence which refusal was prejudicial to the rights of the petitioners and appellants." Hereunder it is urged that error was committed by the court in sustaining objections interposed by respondents to certain questions pro- Dec. 1926.]                                                                                          ESTATE OF HAUPT.                                                                                          149

pounded by appellants and covered by exceptions numbered 1 to 64. We are in accord with the appellants' concession that "it is impracticable to discuss each ruling separately." For like reason it is impracticable for us to pass upon each ruling separately. We have examined all of the rulings complained of. Many of them, standing alone, might properly be held erroneous, but when considered in the light of the evidence elsewhere admitted they are not prejudicial. The trial court very rigidly confined the examination of witnesses upon the issue of the decedent's mental capacity to those limits prescribed and enunciated by this court upon innumerable occasions. Taken as a whole the court exercised a reasonable control over the examination. (Sec. 2044, Code Civ. Proc.)

[2] It is next urged that the execution of the will was procured through fraud and undue influence. In support of this claim it is stated that the decedent at the time of the execution of the will was in poor physical and mental condition; that she did not know whether she was signing the original draft of the will or a corrected copy thereof; and that the witness Spence, being the vice-president of the respondent bank, had "tremendous influence" over its customers, of whom the decedent was one. From an examination of the evidence we feel no hesitancy in stating that there is nothing therein that even tends to savor of fraud or undue influence. The appellants' contention that the failure of the witness Spence to inform the decedent whether her suggested changes in the original draft of the will had been made supports the charge of fraud cannot be sustained. After testifying that the decedent requested certain changes to be made in said original draft, the witness Spence testified that he took the redrafted will to her and that he and decedent read it over together; that thereafter no changes were suggested or made, and that the will as redrafted was executed. This uncontradicted evidence was ample to establish that the will as executed was in complete accord with the decedent's wishes and expressed desires. The claim of fraud is without merit.

Nor is there anything in the record which tends to show that decedent would have executed a different instrument had the witness Spence not assisted her in its preparation 150                                      ESTATE OF HAUPT.                                      [200 Cal.

and execution. As declared in *Estate of Perkins*, 195 Cal. 699 [235 Pac. 45]: "There is an utter lack of any proof of pressure brought to bear upon the testatrix which overpowered her mind and overcame her volition at the very time the will was made. (*In re Rick's Estate*, 160 Cal. 450 [117 Pac. 532].)" [3] The mere fact that the decedent was a customer of the respondent bank, of which the witness Spence was an official, would not support an inference of undue influence.

[4] As a third ground of appeal the appellants contend that the trial court erred with reference to the "law of the case." It is urged that the presumption of sanity was overcome by substantial evidence and that the issue of testamentary capacity should therefore have been submitted to the jury for determination. With this contention we are not in accord. The case of *Estate of Perkins*, supra, contains a concise but complete statement of the law bearing upon the question of testamentary capacity. Applying the principles announced in that case the conclusion is inescapable that the contestants failed to sustain the burden of establishing the fact that at the time of the execution of the will the testatrix was of unsound mind. Considering the evidence introduced on behalf of the appellants in a light most favorable to their contention it cannot be said that it is sufficient to establish that on April 17, 1922, the day upon which the will was executed, the decedent was affected with general testamentary incapacity or was suffering from such insane delusions that she was not on that day familiar with the extent of her property, did not know those who would be the natural objects of her bounty, or that she did not know and understand the nature of the act in which she was then engaged. (*Estate of Dolbeer*, 149 Cal. 227 [9 Ann. Cas. 795, 86 Pac. 695]; *Estate of Purcell*, 164 Cal. 300 [128 Pac. 932]; *Estate of Collins*, 174 Cal. 663 [164 Pac. 1110]; *Estate of Presho*, 196 Cal. 639 [238 Pac. 944].) A careful survey of the record reveals that it is devoid of all evidence which would tend to support either a claim of fraud, undue influence, or testamentary incapacity, and the trial court therefore was not in error in dismissing the petition for revocation of probate as to said issues without submitting them to the jury. If the cause had been submitted to the Dec. 1926.]                                                                 Esate of Haupt.                                                                 151

jury and a verdict favorable to the contestants had been returned on any or all of said issues it would have been the duty of the court, under the evidence, to have set aside the verdict.

[5] Appellants urge as their final ground of appeal that the will in question was not properly witnessed. The claim is that the bank, as executor and trustee of the decedent's estate, had a beneficial and financial interest therein which disqualified its employees from witnessing the will. This contention is based on the assertion that a person named therein as executor may not witness the execution of a will and that if the executor may not act in that capacity the employees of the executor may not so act. It has been held that a person named as executor may properly serve as a subscribing witness (Baker v. Bancroft, 79 Ga. 672 [5 S. E. 46]; Jones v. Larrabee, 47 Me. 474; Sears v. Dillingham, 12 Mass. 358; Stewart v. Harriman, 56 N. H. 25 [22 Am. Rep. 408]). Page on Wills, section 199, states that: "The reasons given by the older cases for holding an executor to be incompetent [as a subscribing witness] have been entirely abandoned by the courts. His commissions are looked upon as merely a compensation for services rendered, and as giving him no financial interest in the probating of the will. . . . Accordingly, it is now held by the great weight of modern authority that an executor has, at the time of the execution of the will, no such beneficial interest thereunder as renders him incompetent." This view found early expression in this state (Panaud v. Jones, 1 Cal. 488, 506; Estate of Egan, 6 Cof. Prob. Dec. 28, 30).

The respondent bank was also appointed by the will to act as trustee after final distribution. The superior court retains jurisdiction over the trust estate after distribution for the purpose of the settlement of the accounts of the trustee (sec. 1699, Code Civ. Proc.), and on such accounting the trustee is allowed only such compensation as the court may deem just and reasonable (sec. 1700, Code Civ. Proc.). Compensation which the respondent may receive as executor is also provided for by statute (sec. 1618, Code Civ. Proc.), and it will receive the same as compensation for services rendered and not as an interest in the estate by will or by succession (Estate of Simonton, 183 Cal. 53 [190 Pac. 442]). In an 152 ESTATE OF SMITH. [200 Cal.
early case it was held that a subscribing witness is not rendered incompetent as a witness by holding lands in trust for a devisee (Peralta v. Castro, 6 Cal. 354).

It was shown that the subscribing witnesses herein were employees of the respondent bank. They were known to the decedent and were requested to act at her suggestion. When the executor and trustee has no further interest than the compensation for acting as such he is not thereby rendered incompetent to act as a subscribing witness, and it would follow that the employees of such executor and trustee would not be incompetent. Assuming that an executor or trustee had a disqualifying interest by reason of some discretionary powers exercisable under the terms of the will, still, when, as here, it does not appear that the subscribing witnesses were stockholders or officers of the respondent their interest as employees would seem to be in no sense proprietary and would be too indefinite, uncertain, remote, and contingent to affect their competency as witnesses (Peralta v. Castro, supra).

The judgment is affirmed.

In the Matter of the Estate of D. K. SMITH, Deceased.
BARBARA M. SMITH, Appellant, v. JOHN E.
SPAULDING, Respondent.

[1] ESTATES OF DECEASED PERSONS—WILLS—TESTAMENTARY CAPACITY—EVIDENCE.—The actual mental condition of the decedent at the time of the execution of his will is the question to be determined upon a contest of the will based on his alleged incompetency, and evidence tending to show unsoundness of mind, either before or after the execution of the will, is important only in so far as it tends to show mental condition at the time of the execution of the will; and to overcome the presumption of sanity the contestant

1. See 26 Cal. Jur. 635. Dec. 1926.] ESTATE OF SMITH. 153

must show affirmatively and by a preponderance of the evidence that the testator was of unsound mind at the time he executed his will.

[2] Id.—MENTAL DERANGEMENT—CHARACTER OF.—Mental derangement sufficient to invalidate a will must be insanity in one of two forms: (1) insanity of such broad character as to establish mental incompetency generally, or (2) some specific and narrower form of insanity under which the testator is the victim of some hallucination or delusion; and even in the latter class of cases the evidence must establish that the will itself was the creature or product of such hallucination or delusion.

[3] Id.—TESTAMENTARY CAPACITY—TEST.—A testator is of sound and disposing mind and memory if, at the time of making his will, he has sufficient mental capacity to be able to understand the nature of the act he is doing, to understand and recollect the nature and situation of his property and to remember, and understand, his relations to the persons who have claims upon his bounty and whose interests are affected by the provisions of the instrument.

[4] Id.—WILL CONTEST—UNSOUNDNESS OF MIND—UNDUE INFLUENCE—INSUFFICIENCY OF EVIDENCE.—In this will contest it is held that the evidence was not sufficient to establish that the testator was incompetent at the time that he executed his will, or to warrant an inference that he was induced to make the will as the result of the undue influence of the sole beneficiary.

[5] Id.—DEFINITION OF UNDUE INFLUENCE—EVIDENCE.—Undue influence is defined to be the exercise of acts or conduct by one person toward another person by means of which the mind of the latter is subjected to the will of the person seeking to control it, and in order to establish that the will has been executed under undue influence it is necessary to show, not only that such influence has been exercised, but also that it has produced an effect upon the mind of the testator by which the will which he executes is not the expression of his own desires; and the presumption of undue influence is not raised by proof of interest and opportunity alone, but there must be substantial proof of pressure which overpowered the volition of the testator at the time the will was made.

[6] Id.—UNNATURAL WILL—PRESUMPTIONS.—The fact that the will of a testator may be unnatural, unfair, or unjust creates of itself no presumption that the decedent was incompetent or that the instrument was procured by undue influence; nor does it shift the burden of proof to the proponent.

[7] Id.—FAIRNESS AND JUSTNESS OF WILL.—A will disinheriting the widow of the deceased and devising all of the estate to a friend cannot be said to be unfair, unjust, or unnatural, where it is shown that the testator and the sole beneficiary had been intimate friends for many years; that decedent was solicitous of the beneficiary's well-being and had often loaned him money for various purposes; that he had even expressed the desire and willingness to assist the beneficiary in acquiring his own home, and that the beneficiary had cared for the decedent in his last illness; and it further appeared that the decedent and his wife, the contestant, had experienced certain matrimonial difficulties which terminated in the filing of a divorce action by the contestant, which action proved abortive, but the parties had never resumed marital relations thereafter, and the decedent had stated that the contestant had sufficient property in her own name.

[8] Id.—REMARKS OF COURT—LACK OF PREJUDICE.—In this will contest it is held that the contestant was not injured as a result of the trial court's declaration that he was not assisted in the determination of the cause by the testimony of a certain doctor and that the introduction of similar expert testimony would therefore tend to "waste time," the court not having precluded the contestant from introducing further expert testimony; and it is further held that the rulings of the court excluding certain testimony of doctors as being privileged within the provisions of subdivision 4 of section 1881 of the Code of Civil Procedure were correct.

THE COURT.—This is an appeal from an order and judgment of the superior court of the county of Los Angeles admitting to probate the will of D. K. Smith, deceased.

The decedent at the time of his death, which occurred on February 28, 1925, was seventy-nine years of age. His widow, contestant and appellant, survived him but he left no issue. By a will bearing date February 23, 1925, the decedent devised and bequeathed his entire estate to the proponent and respondent, who was a friend of some years' standing. On March 5, 1925, the proponent filed a petition for probate of said will and prayed that letters of administration with the will annexed be issued to him. The appellant thereupon filed her contest alleging, among other things, that she was the surviving widow of said decedent; that at the time of the execution of the will the decedent was not of sound and disposing mind, and that the execution thereof was procured through undue influence. A trial of said contest was had before the court without a jury and the order and judgment admitting the will to probate, and from which this appeal is prosecuted, were duly entered.

Inasmuch as the contestant reiterates herein that the decedent was without testamentary capacity at the time the will was executed and that said will was the creature and product of undue influence exerted upon the testator by the proponent thereof, we will set forth in substance the evidence relating to or bearing upon those issues.

Barbara M. Smith, the contestant, testified that she was the widow of the decedent and that he was seventy-nine years of age at the time of his death; that he was taken sick on February 23, 1925; that he was seriously ill, his heart failing and his body in a state of utter collapse; that he refused to leave the cabin where he had been living in back of her house and declined to go to a hospital; that she saw the proponent about the decedent's cabin on the day the will was executed; that proponent came to her house at 9 P. M. on said day and during the course of the conversation inquired if the witness thought that decedent would die during the night; that she went to decedent's cabin at 10 P. M. that night and the proponent and his wife were there; that decedent was in bed "in a semi-conscious condition, with his eyes half open, and his mouth open, panting for breath"; 156 ESTATE OF SMITH. [200 Cal.
that he was "apparently unconscious,—in a stupor or daze"; that decedent did not recognize her; that "his mind worked very slowly"; that she saw decedent at 5:30 A. M. the following morning and "he was very much worse than the night before"; that "his mind was dazed"; that he was taken to a hospital on February 24, 1925; that in the afternoon of said day he "appeared to be better"; that "he appeared rational then."

Thomas Lavell testified that he knew the decedent and his wife intimately; that he saw decedent at the hospital on February 25, 1925, and found him to be "an extremely sick man"; that he was "really too sick to be conversed with" and "was half out of his head, you might say"; that he answered some questions "irrelevantly" and others "relevantly"; that when he first saw decedent at the hospital he thought he was semi-delirious because he failed to reply to some questions.

Marcel L. Maxey testified that he saw decedent at the hospital the day preceding his death and "he seemed rather in a daze."

John E. Spaulding, proponent, called on behalf of the contestant under section 2055 of the Code of Civil Procedure, testified that he stayed with the decedent on February 23, 1925, continually from 9:30 A. M. until 6 A. M. the following day with the exception of but a few short periods; that the contestant came to the cabin a few times during this period to see and inquire of the decedent; that she asked the witness if the decedent had made "out any papers" and suggested that he prevail upon the decedent to go to a hospital as she did not "want him to stay down here and disgrace me any longer"; that in response to the decedent's interrogatories he conveyed to him the substance of the witness' conversation with the contestant; that the decedent stated, "Well, she is awful confounded interested about me now. I will make a will. Look over in the drawer and you will find some paper"; that he dictated the will to the witness' wife; that decedent signed it and witness and his wife also signed at the end thereof; that decedent said, "You will need a witness to this. Go and get Mr. Britt"; that the other witness was secured; that decedent asked the proponent to keep the will; that decedent discussed some of the Dec. 1926.]                                                                                          ESTATE OF SMITH.                                                                                          157

property with him; that he and his wife were alone with the decedent during the night on which the will was executed.

Dr. John L. Kirkpatrick testified in response to a lengthy hypothetical question that in his opinion the decedent at the time of executing the will was "irrational and incompetent"—this answer was apparently based on his next statement that "A man of his age, if he was suffering from this acute autointoxication and absorption of poisons, and he was irrational Monday morning, and he was also irrational Tuesday, he certainly could not have recovered any normal state Monday night. If he died of acute autointoxication, he would not be clear at any time. There might be apparently intervals in which he would seem to be talking all right, but he would never be perfectly clear to a person who was skilled and was watching him."

On cross-examination the witness testified that if the decedent at the time of executing the will had intelligently discussed his property and exercised good business judgment he would "think it was all right." In response to a question propounded by the court the witness stated that if the decedent was not irrational on Monday and Tuesday there was nothing else to indicate that decedent was incompetent when he executed the will "only his age and his general sickness."

Miss L. J. Sherrod testified that she had been the decedent's day nurse; that he recognized all of his friends that came to see him and spoke with them; that "he appeared to be rational, all the time, and conscious"; that he answered questions "rationally and reasonably"; that "his mentality seemed quite clear all the time."

Mrs. Geneva Spaulding, wife of the proponent, testified that decedent dictated the will to her and that she wrote it on paper; that decedent signed it and requested the witness and her husband to sign their names and suggested that a witness be procured; that her husband secured Mr. Robert L. Britt, and he signed as a witness at decedent's request and after the latter had declared the instrument to be his will and acknowledged his signature; that the will was executed after 10 P. M. on February 23, 1925.

Robert L. Britt testified that proponent came for him after midnight on February 23, 1925; that they went to the 158 ESTATE OF SMITH. [200 Cal.
decedent's cabin; that he conversed with the decedent; that decedent stated he had made and signed a will, which decedent read to the witness, and asked the latter to sign his name as a witness thereto; that "a man that would talk as intelligently as he did, especially in a business matter of that kind, I would consider of very sound mind."

As indicated at the commencement of this synoptical statement we have attempted to set forth in substance only that evidence which might have some bearing on the issues of testamentary capacity and undue influence.

[1] The actual mental condition of the decedent at the time of the execution of the will is the question to be determined upon a contest based on his alleged incompetency and evidence tending to show unsoundness of mind either before or after the execution of the will is important only in so far as it tends to show mental condition at the time of the execution of the will. (Estate of Perkins, 195 Cal. 699 [235 Pac. 45]; Estate of Casarotti, 184 Cal. 73 [192 Pac. 1085]; Estate of Dolbeer, 149 Cal. 227 [9 Ann. Cas. 795, 86 Pac. 695].) To overcome the presumption of sanity the contestant must show affirmatively and by a preponderance of the evidence that the testator was of unsound mind at the time he executed his will. (Estate of Casarotti, supra; Estate of Gow, 181 Cal. 106 [183 Pac. 794].)

[2] It is declared in Estate of Perkins, supra, that "Mental derangement sufficient to invalidate a will must be insanity in one of two forms: (1) insanity of such broad character as to establish mental incompetency generally, or (2) some specific and narrower form of insanity under which the testator is the victim of some hallucination or delusion," and even in this latter class of cases the evidence "must establish that the will itself was the creature or product of such hallucination or delusion."

[3] A testator is of sound and disposing mind and memory if, at the time of making his will, he has sufficient mental capacity to be able to understand the nature of the act he is doing, and to understand and recollect the nature and situation of his property and to remember, and understand his relations to, the persons who have claims upon his bounty and whose interests are affected by the provisions of the instrument. (Estate of Sexton, 199 Cal. 759 [251 Pac. 778]; Dec. 1926.]                                                                                          ESTATE OF SMITH.                                                                                          159

*Estate of De Laveaga*, 165 Cal. 607 [133 Pac. 307]; *Estate of Huston*, 163 Cal. 166 [124 Pac. 852].)

[4] In our opinion the evidence outlined above is not sufficient to establish that the testator was incompetent at the time he executed his will. Disregarding any conflicting evidence and resolving whatever conflicts there may be in the evidence in favor of and granting to the contestant every possible inference to be drawn from the evidence, there still remains a hiatus in the chain of proof that at the time of the execution of the will the testator was mentally incompetent or that he was at the time subject to delusions which in any manner affected his testamentary act.

Nor do we think the evidence above narrated is sufficient to warrant and support an inference that the testator was induced to make the will in question as the result of the undue influence of the sole beneficiary named therein.

[5] Undue influence has been repeatedly defined to be "the exercise of acts or conduct by one person toward another person by means of which the mind of the latter is subjugated to the will of the person seeking to control it." (*Estate of Newhall*, 190 Cal. 709, 717 [28 A. L. R. 778, 214 Pac. 231, 234].) It is declared in *Estate of Bryson*, 191 Cal. 521, 541 [217 Pac. 525, 533], that "In order to establish that a will has been executed under undue influence, it is necessary to show, not only that such influence has been exercised, but also that it has produced an effect upon the mind of the testator by which the will which he executes is not the expression of his own desires. . . . The presumption of undue influence is not raised by proof of interest and opportunity alone. In order to set aside a will for undue influence, there must be substantial proof of a pressure which overpowered the volition of the testator at the time the will was made."

The evidence of the contestant relating to the issue of undue influence does no more than show that the proponent had the opportunity to make the alleged false statements attributed to him touching asserted conversations with the contestant. But there is no showing in addition that the mind of the testator, at the time of the making of the will, was subjugated to and dominated by the desires and designs of the proponent to the point of undue influence. More- 160 ESTATE OF SMITH. [200 Cal.
over, there is a conflict in the evidence as to the correctness or falsity of these statements made by the proponent to the decedent and this was within the province of the trial court to consider.

[6] The fact that the will of a testator may be unnatural, unfair, or unjust creates of itself no presumption that the decedent was incompetent or that the instrument was procured by undue influence, nor does it shift the burden of proof to the proponent. In *Estate of Martin*, 170 Cal. 657, 663 [151 Pac. 138, 141], it is declared that "a testator has the right to make an unjust, or an unreasonable, or even a cruel will and that no will may be legally set aside upon the mere establishment that it is such a will."

[7] We do not wish to be understood as characterizing the will in question as an "unfair, unjust or unnatural" will. In our view the evidence tends to stamp it as a fair and just will, for it was shown that the decedent and proponent had been intimate friends for many years; that decedent was solicitous of the proponent's well-being and had often loaned him money for various purposes; that he had often expressed the desire and willingness to assist proponent in acquiring his own home, and that the proponent had cared for the decedent in his last illness. On the other hand, the evidence tends to show that the decedent and contestant had experienced certain marital difficulties which terminated in the filing of a divorce action by the contestant in 1916 or 1917; that said divorce action proved abortive; that decedent and contestant had never resumed marital relations thereafter, and that the decedent had stated that the contestant had sufficient property in her own name. When these matters and circumstances are borne in mind they tend in some degree to account for and explain the dispositive provisions of the decedent's will.

[8] We are not prepared to hold that the contestant was injured as a result of the trial court's declaration that he was not assisted in the determination of the cause by the testimony of Dr. J. L. Kirkpatrick and that the introduction of similar expert testimony would therefore tend to "waste time." The court did not preclude the contestant from introducing further expert testimony, for he further declared, "I don't want to be arbitrary if you feel that you want to put him on, I will give you the opportunity to do so." Dec. 1926.] REDO Y CIA v. FIRST NAT. BANK. 161

Moreover, as contestant's plan was to ask "the same line of questions propounded to Dr. Kirkpatrick," and as the principal hypothetical question put to said witness contained matters which had not been established by the evidence adduced, it follows that contestant suffered no prejudicial injury as a result of the court's expression of its attitude in the premises.

The rulings of the court below excluding certain testimony of Dr. W. P. Burke and Dr. J. F. Scherfee as being privileged within the provisions of subdivision 4 of section 1881 of the Code of Civil Procedure were correct. (In re Redfield, 116 Cal. 637, 644 [48 Pac. 794]; Estate of Nelson, 132 Cal. 182, 187 [64 Pac. 294]; Estate of Budan, 156 Cal. 230, 232 [104 Pac. 442].)

An examination of the several asserted "errors in law" fails to disclose anything prejudicial to the contestant.

It was for the trial court to weigh and pass upon the asserted discrepancies and falsities in the evidence adduced by the proponent.

For the foregoing reasons the order and judgment appealed from are hereby affirmed.

REDO Y CIA (a Copartnership, etc.), Appellant, v. FIRST NATIONAL BANK OF LOS ANGELES (a Corporation), Respondent.

[1] JURY TRIALS—DIRECTED VERDICTS—POWER OF COURT.—While the trial judge may not interfere with or control the jury in passing upon the evidence, he nevertheless exercises a salutary supervisory power over their verdict; and it is the province and duty of the court to instruct the jury upon the law, and such instructions are binding on the latter in its deliberations.

[2] ID.—TENDER OF VERDICT—EXCESS OF LEGAL LIABILITY—POWER OF COURT.—Where a jury tenders a verdict for an amount in excess of the lawful limit of liability on the part of the defendant, in

1. See 24 Cal. Jur. 794.
2. See 24 Cal. Jur. 897.
200 Cal.—11 162 REDO Y CIA V. FIRST NAT. BANK. [200 Cal.

violation of the court's instructions, the court has the right to refuse to receive the verdict, and a change in the verdict to come within the limit of legal liability constitutes an amendment which can properly be made before the verdict is recorded and prior to the discharge of the jury; and the fact that such amendment was made by the jury under compulsion of the court is not significant, as the jurors are not at liberty to refuse obedience to the court's instructions on matters of law, any error of the court in its instructions being reviewable on appeal.

[3] Id.—REFUSAL TO POLL JURY—LACK OF PREJUDICE.—Assuming that error is committed by a trial court in refusing a party's request for a poll of the jury, no prejudice results therefrom, where it appears that all the jurors were in favor of a verdict for the party and so announced themselves on the return of the verdict that was recorded.

[4] BILLS OF EXCHANGE—DISHONOR OF BILLS—WAIVER OF PROTEST—IMPLIED FINDINGS.—In an action to recover a certain sum paid by plaintiff to defendant bank for foreign bills of exchange, by returning a verdict favorable to the plaintiff, the jury impliedly determined that the evidence in the case was sufficient to show a dishonor of the bills of exchange by the drawee bank and a waiver by the drawer bank of the formality of protest.

[5] Id.—MEASURE OF DAMAGES—LAW APPLICABLE.—In such a case, where the bills of exchange antedated the adoption by this state of the Uniform Negotiable Instruments Law, the measure of damages recoverable from the drawer upon dishonor must be found in the law in effect prior to the adoption of the former law.

[6] Id.—SECTIONS 3234 TO 3239, CIVIL CODE—CONSTRUCTION.—Under sections 3234 to 3239 of the Civil Code, the amount recoverable upon the dishonor of bills of exchange by a foreign drawee is the value of the foreign money in which the bills of exchange were expressed, at the time the bills were presented to the foreign drawee for payment, together with damages of fifteen dollars upon each one hundred dollars thereof and interest on the total from the time payment was demanded of the drawer; and in an action to recover upon such bills the court did not err in confining plaintiff's recovery to that amount.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County. Charles Monroe, Judge. Affirmed. Dec. 1926.] REDO Y CIA v. FIRST NAT. BANK. 163

The facts are stated in the opinion of the court.

Mott & Vallee for Appellant.

Flint, MacKay & Bowen for Respondent.

SHENK, J.—Plaintiff instituted this action to recover $14,200 paid by it to the defendant bank for two foreign bills of exchange drawn by the defendant on the Deutsche Bank of Hamburg, Germany, each being for 40,000 marks.

The plaintiff firm was engaged in the sugar business in Mexico and maintained an office in the city of Los Angeles. In the conduct of its business plaintiff maintained an account with Bartning Gebruder of Hamburg, Germany. On March 22, 1917, plaintiff's Los Angeles manager inquired of the defendant bank the exchange rate on a draft for 40,000 German marks. The defendant bank thereupon wired its correspondent, the Crocker National Bank of San Francisco, and secured from it the rate of exchange, together with its consent to effect the sale. Thereafter and on March 23, 1917, the plaintiff, through its Los Angeles manager, purchased the first bill of exchange for 40,000 marks from the defendant bank. This bill of exchange was drawn on the above-named German bank and was payable to the plaintiff in marks. At the then prevailing rate of exchange the plaintiff paid $6,920 therefor—the exchange rate of each mark being 17.3 cents. On the same day the defendant notified the Crocker Bank of the issuance of the bill of exchange.

The Crocker Bank had an arrangement with the Deutsche Bank Filiale of Hamburg, Germany, dating from the year 1911, under which the latter honored and paid bills of exchange of the former bank and its correspondents to the extent of 500,000 marks at any time, without previous advice or the deposit of funds.

On April 2, 1917, the plaintiff, through its manager, purchased of the defendant bank a second bill of exchange for 40,000 marks similar to the first and paid therefor the sum of $7,280. Upon payment being made each of said bills was delivered by the defendant to the plaintiff's manager. The amount paid for said two bills of exchange totaled $14,200, the sum sued for herein, of which amount the de- 164 Redo y Cia v. First Nat. Bank. [200 Cal.

fendant asserts it retained $25 as commission and then remitted the remainder to the Crocker Bank.

A state of war was declared to exist between the United States and Germany on April 6, 1917, and mail service between the two countries was officially discontinued on the following day. Prior thereto the Crocker Bank had addressed and mailed to the Hamburg Bank a separate advice of each draft, both of which were received by the latter bank. Subsequent advices mailed by the defendant bank to the Hamburg Bank were returned marked "Mail service suspended to country addressed." This information was apparently conveyed to the Crocker Bank by the defendant. The continued existence of a state of war between this country and Germany prevented the plaintiff for a considerable period from sending the two drafts to the latter country by mail. Hostilities were terminated on November 11, 1918, by the signing of the armistice, and on July 15, 1919, mail service and commercial transactions between the two countries were resumed. Approximately one month later, August 14, 1919, plaintiff's Los Angeles manager mailed the two bills of exchange to the home office in Mexico for indorsement to Bartning Gebruder, Germany, together with instructions for their forwarding. The bills were inclosed in a letter bearing date August 20, 1919, and addressed to the indorsee in Germany.

Subsequent to the restoration of peace conditions and the resumption of business relations with Germany the Crocker Bank effected a new credit arrangement with the Hamburg Bank, being known as the new account, the previous arrangement thereafter being referred to as the old account. No change had apparently been made in the arrangement, however. The bills of exchange were presented by the indorsee to the Hamburg Bank on September 24, 1919, whereupon the latter cabled the Crocker Bank and inquired if they might be paid from the new account, together with "all old drafts." In reply thereto the Crocker Bank cabled to ascertain the status of the old account and to learn "why above drafts cannot be charged against same." On October 1, 1919, the Hamburg Bank cabled the Crocker Bank to the effect that at the close of business the old account had a balance of 100,000 marks, but that "according peace condi- Doc. 1926.] REDO Y CIA v. FIRST NAT. BANK. 165

tions you cannot dispose against same." The Crocker Bank addressed a letter bearing date November 6, 1919, to the Hamburg Bank "regarding the matter of paying drafts drawn against our old account to the debit of our new account, and would thank you to hold this matter in abeyance for the time being, advising us, however, when our old account is again at our disposal." Other correspondence passed between the Crocker Bank and the Hamburg Bank relative to the status of the old and new accounts and the payment of the bills of exchange. The bills here involved were never protested, but, after being held for a time by the indorsee, were returned to the plaintiff at Los Angeles. This action to recover the amount paid for said bills of exchange grew out of the return thereof.

Among other things the trial court instructed the jury that laches was not chargeable to the plaintiff nor was the defendant bank relieved of any liability by reason of any delay in the presentation of the drafts to the Hamburg Bank occasioned by the existence of a state of war between the United States and Germany, and that it was the duty of the jury to determine whether the defendant bank had waived protest of the drafts. The jury was further instructed that should it determine that the plaintiff was entitled to recover, such recovery would and should be limited to the value of 80,000 marks in United States money on September 24, 1919, the date of presentment to the drawee, or $3,600; that in addition thereto the plaintiff would be entitled to damages of $15 on each $100 thereof, or $540, together with interest on $4,140—the total of the principal sum and damages—from the date of demand made by plaintiff on the defendant, which date was to be determined by the jury.

After deliberating the jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff in the sum of $14,200—the full amount paid by it for the bills of exchange. The verdict was passed to the court and it declared that "The court cannot accept that verdict. I told you what the extreme amount was that you could find. That is all there is to it. You will retire again." Considerable discussion thereupon ensued between the court and individual jurors and the court again instructed them that they could award no more than $4,140 and interest thereon to the plaintiff. The jury again retired and brought 166 REDO Y CIA V. FIRST NAT. BANK. [200 Cal.

in a verdict in accordance with the court's instructions and judgment thereon was duly entered.

Plaintiff urges as a first ground of appeal that the court erred in declining to receive and record the first verdict brought in by the jury. Appellant contends that "the court was bound in law to receive the first verdict rendered by the jury. It could thereafter, on motion, set it aside and order a new trial, but it had no power to compel the jury to render a verdict different in substance." We cannot uphold this contention. In its instructions the trial court informed the jury that in the event they found or concluded that appellant was entitled to recover from the respondent, such recovery was to be for $4,140, together with interest. The jurors entirely disregarded the law as set forth in the court's instructions and brought in a verdict opposed thereto. In our opinion the lower court very properly declined to accept such a verdict and acted within its province when it instructed the jury to again retire and bring in a verdict in conformity with the instructions. [1] While the trial judge may not interfere with or control the jury in passing upon the evidence, he nevertheless exercises a salutary supervisory power over their verdict. (People v. Knutte, 111 Cal. 453, 455, [44 Pac. 166].) It is the province and the duty of the court to instruct the jury upon the law and such instructions are binding on the latter in its deliberations. (Estate of Sharon, 179 Cal. 447, 460 [177 Pac. 283].) In the case of Logan v. Lewis, 35 Cal. App. 663, 666 [170 Pac. 851], the jury, at the suggestion of the trial court, accompanied by proper instructions, amended its verdict by reducing the amount of the special damages awarded. The procedure therein pursued was upheld, and the opinion declares that "Inasmuch as the verdict of the jury had not been recorded nor the jury discharged, we think the court was warranted in permitting the jury to make this amendment. (Code Civ. Proc., sec. 619; 38 Cyc. 1893, 4; 22 Ency. Pl. & Pr. 967, 8; McNutt v. Pabst, 25 Cal. App. 177 [143 Pac. 77]; Conlin v. Lewis Inv. Co., 26 Cal. App. 388 [147 Pac. 472].)"

[2] We are of the view that the change made in the verdict constituted an amendment which could properly be made before the verdict had been recorded and prior to the discharge of the jury. This amendment was necessary so that the verdict would be in conformity with the instruc- Dec. 1926.] REDO Y CIA v. FIRST NAT. BANK. 167

tions. We do not regard as significant the fact that the amendment was made by the jury under compulsion. If it were held otherwise "the refractory jurors would be able to compel a new trial and thus defeat the exercise by the court of a power which it clearly possesses." (*Estate of Sharon, supra.*)

When the court instructed the jury as to the lawful limit of liability on the part of the defendant, if the jury should find the defendant liable at all, the court thereby indicated the only amount for which a judgment could lawfully be rendered. The jurors were not at liberty to refuse obedience to this instruction. If the court be in error in giving such an instruction the error may be revised and corrected on appeal.

Nothing said herein is opposed to the principles enunciated by the several cases referred to in appellant's briefs. In none of those cases did the jury disregard the instructions of the court upon a question of law and bring in a verdict contrary thereto. In the main those cases presented instances where the jury had passed upon questions of fact and the trial court had attempted to substitute its opinion in the place and stead thereof. As declared in one of said cases, "The functions of the jury in determining the facts of the case were usurped by the judge." (*Langdon v. Superior Court, 65 Cal. App. 41, 43 [223 Pac. 72].*) Such is not this case.

[3] Assuming that error was committed by the trial court in refusing the appellant's request for a poll of the jury, we think no prejudice resulted therefrom, for the reason that the jurors were all in favor of a verdict for the appellant and so announced themselves on the return of the verdict that was recorded. As to the amount of said verdict the polling of the jury would have been a "mere useless ceremony." (*See Estate of Sharon, supra.*)

[4] Before considering the amount of damages awarded to the appellant it may be said that by returning a verdict favorable to the appellant the jury impliedly determined that the evidence in the case was sufficient to show a dishonor of the two bills of exchange by the drawee bank and a waiver by the respondent drawer bank of the formality of protest. As these implied findings of the jury are not at- 168 Redo y Cia v. First Nat. Bank. [200 Cal.

tacked on this appeal the correctness thereof will not now be questioned.

[5] It remains to be determined whether the trial court correctly instructed the jury as to the amount of damages that might be awarded to the appellant in the event the jury was of the opinion that appellant should recover. In the solution of this problem we are precluded from having recourse to the provisions of the Uniform Negotiable Instruments Law as incorporated in the Civil Code July 31, 1917 (Stats. 1917, p. 1531). It is appropriate to note, however, that section 3266 of the new law provides: "The provisions of this title do not apply to negotiable instruments made and delivered prior to the taking effect hereof. . . ." The two bills of exchange involved herein were made and delivered on March 23 and April 2, 1917, respectively. Said two bills having antedated the adoption by this state of the Uniform Negotiable Instruments Law, the measure of damages recoverable from the drawer upon dishonor must be found in the law in effect prior to July 31, 1917. [6] Sections 3234 to 3239, inclusive, of the Civil Code constituted the law of this state when the two bills of exchange were sold, and were determinative of the amount of damages recoverable from the respondent bank upon the dishonor of said bills by the drawee and protest or waiver thereof. Section 3234 provided: "Damages are allowed as hereinafter prescribed, as a full compensation for interest accrued before notice of dishonor, re-exchange, expenses, and all other damages, in favor of holders for value only, upon bills of exchange drawn or negotiated within this state, and protested for nonacceptance or nonpayment." Section 3235 provided: "Damages are allowed under the last section upon bills drawn upon any person; . . . (3) if drawn upon a person in any place in a foreign country, fifteen dollars upon each one hundred dollars of the principal sum specified in the bill." Section 3236 provided: "From the time of notice of dishonor and demand of payment, lawful interest must be allowed upon the aggregate amount of the principal sum specified in the bill, and the damages mentioned in the preceding section." Section 3237 provided: "If the amount of a protested bill of exchange is expressed in money of the United States damages are estimated upon such amount without regard to the rate of exchange," and section 3238 provided: "If the amount of a protested bill of exchange is expressed in foreign money Dec. 1926.] REDO Y CIA v. FIRST NAT. BANK. 169

damages are estimated upon the value of a similar bill at the time of protest, in the place nearest to the place where the bill was negotiated, and where such bills are currently sold."

The amount of the bills of exchange involved herein was expressed in foreign money, and under said section 3238 the appellant was entitled to recover the value of said 80,000 marks at the time the bills were presented to the Hamburg Bank for payment, the jury having impliedly determined that protest had been waived. At the then existing rate of exchange, according to the record herein, said 80,000 marks would be the equivalent of $3,600 in United States money. In addition to this principal sum the appellant was entitled under section 3235 to damages of $15 upon each $100 thereof ($540), and interest, under section 3236, on the total of said two sums, or on $4,140, from the time payment was demanded of respondent.

The trial court's instructions upon the damages recoverable by appellant, as set forth in substance above, were in strict accordance with the rule of damages expressly declared by the above sections, and the trial court therefore did not err in confining the appellant's recovery as indicated. If German marks had increased in value the appellant would have been entitled to recover at the current rate. The fact that they depreciated in value could not affect the rule.

In view of the statutory rule of damages fixing the amount of recovery upon dishonored bills of exchange issued prior to the adoption by this state of the Uniform Negotiable Instruments Law, it becomes unnecessary to consider and discuss the numerous cases from other jurisdictions cited by the parties hereto. Since the statutory rule of damages is applicable in all cases of dishonored bills of exchange it is likewise unnecessary to pass upon the several contentions of the parties touching the cause of the dishonor of the two bills herein involved.

As the appellant was awarded the maximum damages to which it is entitled under the law a review of further asserted errors of the trial court would serve no useful purpose.

The judgment is affirmed.

FRANK P. DOYLE et al., Petitioners, v. FRANK C. JORDAN, as Secretary of State, etc., Respondent.

[1] BRIDGE AND HIGHWAY DISTRICTS — PETITION FOR ORGANIZATION — WITHDRAWAL OF SIGNATURES.—Under the act of 1923 (Stats. 1923, p. 452), as amended in 1925 (Stats. 1925, p. 714), for the incorporation and management of bridge and highway districts, signers of the petition for the formation of such a district cannot legally withdraw their names from such petition after the same has been certified as sufficient by the county clerk of the county in which it was circulated and presented to and filed with the Secretary of State as provided by said act.

[2] Id.—INTENTION TO JOIN DISTRICT — ORDINANCE OF SUPERVISORS — ATTEMPTED REPEAL.—Where the board of supervisors of a county has passed an ordinance to the effect that the county intends to unite with such other counties as may adopt like ordinances to form a bridge and highway district under the act of 1923, and amendment thereto, and the petition provided for by said ordinance has been circulated, signed, certified, and presented to the Secretary of State, it is too late for said board to repeal said ordinance, as the powers granted it under the statute were exhausted by passing the first mentioned ordinance.

[3] Id.—OFFER TO JOIN DISTRICT — ATTEMPTED WITHDRAWAL — CONSTRUCTION.—There is no merit in the contention that the passage by a board of supervisors of an ordinance, under said act, declaring it to be the intention of the county to join a bridge and highway district is but an offer or proposal on the part of the county and that it may be withdrawn or revoked at any time before its acceptance.

[4] Id.—OFFER—ACCEPTANCE.—Conceding that an ordinance passed by a board of supervisors declaring it to be the intention of the county to join with other counties in the formation of a bridge and highway district to be an offer or proposal only, where it was made in accordance with the statute and made "to unite with such other counties as may adopt like ordinance," and other counties adopted like ordinances and following the passage of said ordinance took all proceedings required of them by said statute in order to join said bridge and highway district, the offer made by the first county was accepted by the other counties and an

attempt of the board of supervisors of the first county to withdraw therefrom was too late and accordingly ineffectual.

[5] Id.—ACCEPTANCE OF OFFER BY OTHER COUNTIES—NUMBER.—Where it was the clear intention of a board of supervisors to adopt an ordinance in compliance with the terms of the statute to unite with such other counties as might adopt like ordinances for the formation of a bridge and highway district, it was not impossible to accept said offer so long as any one or more other counties passed a similar ordinance, and the passage of such ordinance by any of said other counties was of itself an acceptance of the offer of the first county to join in the district.

[6] Id.—DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT.—Although a description of the project for which it is proposed to form a bridge and highway district is not set forth nor mentioned in either the ordinance passed by the boards of supervisors or in the petition circulated and signed by the electors, where there is officially of record in each of the counties of the district a document among the proceedings to incorporate the district in which the object and purpose or the project for which said district is to be formed is definitely and distinctly set forth, this sufficiently complies with the statute.

[7] Id.—CONSTITUTIONALITY OF STATUTE—DUE PROCESS—TAKING OF PRIVATE PROPERTY—TITLE OF STATUTE.—The contention that the act for the incorporation of bridge and highway districts is unconstitutional because it seeks to deprive persons of their property without due process of law and to take private property for private uses, and that more than one subject is embraced within the title of the statute, cannot be maintained.

[8] Id.—BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF DISTRICT—LEVYING TAXES—CONSTITUTIONAL LAW.—Even if an attempt to clothe the directors of a bridge and highway district with power to levy taxes is beyond the constitutional authority of the legislature, this question cannot be raised in a proceeding instituted for the sole purpose of testing the validity of those provisions of the act providing for the incorporation and formation of the district, as the district when incorporated may be a valid and constitutional agency of the state, although some of the powers with which the legislature may have sought to invest the directors thereof are invalid and unconstitutional, which defects may be cured by further legislation.

[9] Id.—EQUALIZATION OF ASSESSMENTS.—The objection that the act for the organization of bridge and highway districts is unconstitutional in that it contains no provision for the equalization of the assessments of property in the different counties embraced in the district cannot be maintained in a proceeding for the sole purpose of testing the validity of the provision of the act for the incorporation and formation of such a district. 172 DOYLE v. JORDAN. [200 Cal.

[10] Id. — CONSTITUTIONAL LAW — ARTICLE XI, SECTION 13, CONSTITUTION. — The act for the incorporation and management of bridge and highway districts does not violate article XI, section 13, of the constitution.

U. S. Webb, Attorney-General, and Robert W. Harrison, Chief Deputy Attorney-General, for Respondent.

Charles A. Strong, Charles M. Mannon and Caspar A. Ornbaum, Amici Curiae.

CURTIS, J.—The petitioners herein by this proceeding seek from this court a writ of mandate directed to the respondent, the Secretary of State, commanding him as such public officer to publish certain notices which petitioners claim respondent is by law required to publish by virtue of certain proceedings set forth in the petition herein, which proceedings were taken under the authority of, and in compliance with, the provisions of a certain act of the legislature providing for the incorporation, organization, and management of bridge and highway districts. Said act is entitled: "An act to provide for the incorporation and management of bridge and highway districts and to provide for the acquisition and construction by said districts of highways, bridges and approaches thereto, and for the acquisition of all property necessary therefor, and also to provide for the issuance and payment of bonds by said districts, for the levying of taxes and the collection of tolls by said districts Dec. 1926.] DOYLE v. JORDAN. 173

and for the annexation of additional territory thereto" [Stats. 1923, p. 452]. This act was amended in some of its essential features by an act of the legislature in 1925 [Stats. 1925, p. 714]. Sections 1 and 2 and a portion of section 3 of said act are as follows:

"Section 1. A bridge and highway district may be organized and incorporated and managed as herein expressly provided, and may exercise the powers herein expressly granted or necessarily implied. The word 'county' as used herein shall include county, and city and county.

"Sec. 2. A bridge and highway district may be organized consisting of one or more counties or parts of a county or counties, and including a city and county, under the provisions of this act, by proceeding as follows: The several boards of supervisors of said counties or parts of counties, may adopt an ordinance to the effect that the county, or part of county, intends to unite with such other counties as may adopt like ordinances to form such district, or such ordinance may, in one or more of said counties, be adopted by the electors of the county under the provisions of the law applicable to the passage of ordinances by the initiative. Each of said counties shall be contiguous to another county therein; provided, that counties separated by any of the waters of this state are contiguous within the meaning of this act. In such ordinance it shall be directed that a petition be circulated therefor, and the board shall, by resolution, name and appoint persons to circulate and secure signatures for the same.

"Sec. 3. Such petition which may consist of any number of separate instruments shall be presented to the secretary of state, signed by qualified electors, residing within the boundaries of the proposed bridge and highway district, equal in number to at least ten per centum of the number of such qualified electors in each county from which such petitions are presented voting for governor of this state at the last general election prior to the presentation of such petition. The board of supervisors of any county may, in lieu of proceeding by petition, call an election, as provided for the calling of special elections under the laws pertaining thereto, to be held in conformity therewith, where and when the same may be determined by a majority vote of the electors voting thereat. 174 DOYLE v. JORDAN. [200 Cal.

"Such petition shall set forth the extent of the district, either by describing its exterior boundaries, or by naming the counties proposed to be included therein, as having been determined by said ordinance and in case only part of any county is proposed to be included therein, the extent of the part of the county included may be indicated by naming the county and excepting therefrom, some administrative or governmental subdivision or subdivisions thereof, such as townships, school districts or other similar subdivisions, or such excluded portion may be described by its boundaries, and in any of said descriptions of included or excluded territory, reference to recorded instruments may be made for the purpose of defining such boundaries, and shall contain a prayer that such proposed bridge and highway district be incorporated under the provisions of this act. Attached to each of the petitions shall be a copy of said ordinance. The said ordinance may be enacted by the board of supervisors at any time after application shall be made to them for such purpose, but in case such board shall neglect to act upon such application for a period of sixty days thereafter, the said ordinance may be submitted to the electors of such county or city and county under the provisions of the initiative applicable thereto. In case said ordinance shall be passed by the board of supervisors, it shall be subject to the referendum provisions applicable to ordinances generally in such county or city and county. The said petitions from any county shall be grouped or fastened together and shall contain a certificate of the county clerk of such county that the same contains the requisite number of qualified signatures of qualified electors. The said county clerk shall have ten days time for the examination of such petitions when left with him for verification and it shall be his duty to verify the same, attach his certificate thereto within said period of time and forward the same to the secretary of state with his certificate that the same is sufficient and if from such examination he shall find that said petition is not signed by the requisite number of qualified electors residing within his county he shall also certify to the number of qualified electors required to make such petition sufficient, and it may be amended by filing a supplemental petition or petitions within twenty days from the date of such certificate, either by the same persons theretofore appointed to secure signatures, Dec. 1926.] DOYLE v. JORDAN. 175

or by other persons appointed by the board of supervisors for that purpose. The county clerk shall within ten days after the filing of such supplemental petition or petitions make like examination of the same and certify to the result of such examination as hereinabove provided. If his certificate shall show any such petition or said petition as amended to be insufficient it shall be filed by him with the secretary of state and kept by him as a public record without prejudice however to the filing of a new petition to the same effect, but if, by the certificate of the county clerk such petition or said petition as amended is shown to be sufficient the county clerk shall present the same to the secretary of state without delay. If any supplemental petition be filed all of the signatures appended to the petition or to the supplemental petition or petitions shall be considered in determining the number of qualified electors signing the petition. In case an election is had in any county in the place of said petition, the county clerk shall certify to the secretary of state the result thereof, with a copy of the action of the board of supervisors authorizing said election.

"After the certificate is issued by the secretary of state for the incorporation of such proposed bridge and highway district, the sufficiency of such petition in any respect shall not be subject to judicial review or be otherwise questioned. If any county within the boundaries of such proposed bridge and highway district shall have a registrar of voters other than the county clerk the said registrar of voters shall perform the duties herein required to be performed by the county clerk respecting the examination, certification and filing of the petition, and said registrar of voters shall return said petition immediately upon the completion of such examination, together with his certificate showing the result of such examination to the secretary of state. When all said petitions, or certifications of the result of elections when such elections are held, have been received from the several county clerks of counties having any portion of their territory within said proposed bridge and highway district the said secretary of state shall publish the text of such petition for at least three weeks before the time set by him as the time up to which protests may be received as hereinafter provided in at least one and not to exceed three newspapers printed and published in each of the counties from which such petitions 176 DOYLE v. JORDAN. [200 Cal.

have been presented, together with a notice stating the time which he has fixed up to which protests will be received against the inclusion of property within such proposed bridge and highway district. The names attached to said petition need not be published therewith, nor the certificates of any of the county clerks or registrars of voters, but it shall be sufficient to state that the same has been signed by a certain number of electors, naming it, and duly verified by such county clerks or registrars of voters.

"At any time before the time set by the secretary of state up to which protests may be received, any owner of property subject to taxation within said proposed bridge and highway district, may file, with the secretary of state, his protest in writing against the formation of such district, and stating therein such grounds as he may have for claiming that his said property, or any portion thereof, will not be benefited by the formation of the proposed bridge and highway district. The said protest shall contain the name and address of the person protesting and the name and address of his attorney, if he has one, and all of the protests so received by the secretary of state shall, with the petition filed from the county, be forwarded by the secretary of state to the superior courts in the respective counties from which the same have been received by the secretary of state, and thereupon the said superior courts shall acquire jurisdiction to hear and determine the said protests so received from the owners of lands located within their respective counties. It shall be the duty of the clerk of said superior courts to set the said matters for hearing before said court, and to give ten days' notice thereof in writing to the protestants, and to any person who shall have filed with the secretary of state his name and address as the attorney for the petitioners in said petition, which said attorneys' names and addresses shall also be certified from the office of the secretary of state to the respective county clerks at the time of the transmission of the petitions thereto. At the time specified in such notice, or at such other time to which the said hearing may be continued, the said superior courts shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine all matters urged by the protestants against the formation of the said proposed bridge and highway district, or against the inclusion of their lands therein, and the said superior courts shall have jurisdiction to exclude Dec. 1926.] DOYLE v. JORDAN. 177

the said lands from said proposed district, together with any other lands contiguous to the excluded lands, and contiguous to the exterior boundaries of the proposed district which are similarly situated to the lands of the protestants, to the end that isolated tracts may not be excluded from the district without also rectifying the boundaries thereof so that the district when finally formed shall be compact, continuous and without tracts of land excluded therefrom which are totally surrounded by other lands which are left within the district.

"The judgment of the superior courts, when given shall be certified by the clerk to the secretary of state, together with the original petitions and protests theretofore transmitted to him by the secretary of state, and the said judgment shall not be appealable, and all questions of fact therein contained shall be final and conclusive upon the whole world, and shall only be subject to review by the supreme court of this state, upon a writ of review issued out of that court in such cases as writs of review are now permissible against superior courts, or the irregular exercise of the jurisdiction of such courts. Such proceedings for a writ or review must be taken within ten days after the entry of the judgment in the superior courts, and if not so taken all judgments of the superior courts shall become final.

"When all of the protests have been disposed of as hereinabove provided, and the results of the judgments therein certified to the secretary of state, the secretary of state shall thereupon issue his certificate of incorporation declaring the said district with the boundaries as finally established to be duly incorporated, formed and organized and shall file the same in his office, and cause a certified copy thereof to be recorded in the office of the county recorders of each of the counties situated within or partially within said proposed bridge and highway district."

By an amendment to the statute in 1925 it was provided that:

"In case the board of supervisors of any county named in the petitions from other counties engaged in the formation of a bridge and highway district shall fail or neglect for sixty days after the application submitted to them, to pass such ordinance, and a period of more than sixty days thereafter shall elapse without any proceeding for passing such ordinance under the provisions of law relating to the in-

200 Cal.—12 178 DOYLE v. JORDAN. [200 Cal.

itiative being on file with the county clerk or registrar of voters, the latter must upon receipt of an affidavit of an elector of the county, setting forth the date of making the original application to the board of supervisors and the failure of such board to act thereon for sixty days thereafter, issue his certificate to the secretary of state attached to such affidavit certifying that on the date of the issuing thereof no proceedings have been filed in his office to submit such ordinance to the electors under the provisions applicable to the initiative, and must forthwith transmit such certificate and affidavit to the secretary of state and the latter shall file the same, and the county from which such affidavit and certificate have been received by the secretary of state shall be excluded by him from the proposed district in the same manner as if the same had been excluded by order of the superior court. . . ."

The act further provides, after the Secretary of State has issued his certificate of incorporation, for the appointment by the boards of supervisors of the respective counties comprising the district of directors to conduct and manage the affairs of the district, defines the powers of such board of directors and provides for the incurring of a bonded indebtedness upon a two-thirds vote of the electors of the district whenever the board of directors deem it necessary.

The amended petition herein alleges that written applications were presented to the board of supervisors of the counties of Del Norte, Humboldt, Mendocino, Lake, Sonoma, Napa, and Marin and of the city and county of San Francisco to pass an ordinance as in said act provided, declaring it to be the intention of such counties and of such city and county to form a bridge and highway district to be known as the Golden Gate Bridge and Highway District; that such ordinances were passed by the board of supervisors of the city and county of San Francisco and of the counties of Del Norte, Mendocino, Sonoma, Napa, and Marin; that thereafter and in each of said last-named counties and in the city and county of San Francisco petitions were circulated identical in form and in all respects as required by said act and praying that said Golden Gate Bridge and Highway District be formed under the provisions of said act of the legislature; that each of said petitions was signed by more than ten per cent of the votes cast in said respective counties and in said Dec. 1926.] DOYLE v. JORDAN. 179

city and county for Governor at the last general election immediately preceding the time when said petitions were circulated; that said petitions with the signatures attached to each thereof were left with the county clerks of said respective counties and with the registrar of voters of the city and county of San Francisco and were by said last-named officers certified to be sufficient and were thereafter transmitted to the respondent as Secretary of State; that there was also filed with the Secretary of State certificates and affidavits as required by said act from the county clerks of Humboldt and Lake Counties setting forth that no ordinances had been passed as required by said act in said county of Humboldt or in said county of Lake within sixty days after the filing of the application therefor, and that no proceedings for the passage of an ordinance under the provisions of law relating to the initiative were on file with the county clerk of either of said counties. Said amended petition further alleges that said respondent has failed, neglected, and refused to advertise in said counties, or in any of them, the notice required by law by him to be advertised and that a demand has been made upon said respondent before the institution of these proceedings that respondent forthwith publish and advertise said official notice so required by him to be made under the provisions of said act; that the respondent after such demand has failed, neglected, and refused to publish said notice in said counties or in any of them.

By the answer and return of the respondent it is admitted that all of the documents and instruments in the matter of the incorporation and organization of the Golden Gate Bridge and Highway District claimed by the petitioners in their amended petition to have been filed in the office of respondent have been filed therein in accordance with the provisions of said act of the legislature providing for the incorporation and organization of the Golden Gate Bridge and Highway District claimed by the petitioners in their amended petition to have been filed in the office of respondent have been filed therein in accordance with the provisions of said act of the legislature providing for the incorporation and organization of bridge and highway districts. Said answer and return further shows that all of said proceedings in the matter of the incorporation and organization of the Golden Gate Bridge and Highway District above referred to had been presented to him 180 DOYLE v. JORDAN. [200 Cal.

and filed in his office by the second day of December, 1925, and that thereafter and on the seventeenth day of December, 1925, there was also tendered to him and received by him in the office of the Secretary of State a document purporting to be a copy of Ordinance Number 222 passed by the board of supervisors of the county of Mendocino on the fifteenth day of December, 1925, entitled "An Ordinance Repealing Ordinance No. 220, Adopted January 27th, 1925, Which Said Ordinance Declared the Intention of the County of Mendocino to Unite With Other Counties Adopting Like Ordinances To Form a Bridge and Highway District, and Directing the Circulation of a Petition for that Purpose," and that there was also on said day presented and tendered to him a resolution passed by the board of supervisors of Mendocino County on the fifteenth day of December, 1925, purporting to revoke, annul, and cancel and set aside said Ordinance Number 220; furthermore, on the twenty-first day of January, 1926, there was tendered to and received by him in the office of the Secretary of State a document purporting also to be a certified copy of said Ordinance Number 222 passed by the board of supervisors of the county of Mendocino on the fifteenth day of December, 1925, whereby it was sought to repeal said Ordinance Number 220; furthermore, on the twenty-first day of January, 1926, there was tendered to and received by him in the office of the Secretary of State five several documents, identical in form, and purporting to be signed by 180 electors of the county of Mendocino who had theretofore signed the petition for the formation of the Golden Gate Bridge and Highway District which had been theretofore circulated in said county of Mendocino and being the same petition which had been certified as sufficient by the county clerk of said county of Mendocino, and by said clerk transmitted to and filed in the office of respondent. The persons signing said last-named five documents each asked to withdraw his name from said petition for the formation of said district. (By deducting said 180 names from the number signed to said original petition by the electors of Mendocino County, the said original petition would be insufficient and would bear the names of less than ten per cent of the qualified electors in said county voting for Governor at the last general election immediately preceding the circulation of said petition.) Dec. 1926.] DOYLE v. JORDAN. 181

The position of respondent as set forth in the answer and return is that with the instruments and documents presented to him as above referred to he is uncertain as to the proper course for him to pursue, and he is in doubt whether he shall publish the required notice as prescribed by said act in the county of Mendocino or in the other counties within said proposed district or at all. However, the *amici curiae* appearing herein and representing the board of supervisors of the county of Mendocino and various organizations and individuals and taxpayers of said county and of other counties interested in resisting the formation of the proposed district take the position that said writ should not issue for any purpose whatever. The first contention of the *amici curiae* is that, by the withdrawal of the 180 names from the original petition received by respondent from the county of Mendocino, said petition is reduced below the number required by the provisions of said act and is therefore insufficient, and no further action can be taken in the proceedings to incorporate said district, at least so far as said county of Mendocino is concerned. [1] This contention involves the right of the signers of said original petition to withdraw their names therefrom after the same has been certified as sufficient by the county clerk of the county of Mendocino and presented to and filed with the Secretary of State as provided by said act. The right of persons signing petitions to be presented to and acted upon by public officials, to withdraw their names therefrom has been before the appellate courts of this state on a limited number of occasions. In the case of *Locher v. Walsh*, 17 Cal. App. 727 [121 Pac. 712], it appeared that a petition had been filed with the city clerk of the city of Auburn praying that a certain ordinance relating to the regulation of the sale of intoxicating liquors in said city be submitted to the vote of the electors thereof. After the clerk had examined the same and had attached his certificate thereto that said petition was signed by more than thirty per cent of the qualified voters of said city, certain of the signers of said petition attempted to withdraw their names therefrom by handing to the clerk a request that their names be withdrawn from said petition. The court in this case held "that the clerk had jurisdiction to determine the sufficiency of the petition as filed, and having determined that it was sufficient, and having so found 182 DOYLE v. JORDAN. [200 Cal.

and certified before any request for withdrawal was made, such request was too late for the petitioners to exercise any such right or to divest the clerk of jurisdiction." This case was followed and approved in the later case of *Lamb v. McLaren*, 28 Cal. App. 632 [153 Pac. 985]. In this latter case a petition was filed to recall a supervisor. The petition was referred to the clerk and certified by him to be sufficient, but, after it had been certified to the board by the clerk as sufficient, certain of the signers attempted to withdraw their names from the petition and thus to reduce it below the number of signers required by law. It was held that upon the certification by the county clerk of the sufficiency of the petition the duty then devolved upon the board of supervisors to order the election and the superior court had no jurisdiction to enjoin the board from so acting on the ground that after such certification and before the calling of the election certain signers to the petition had attempted to withdraw their names therefrom so as to reduce the number below that required to give the board authority to call the election. In *Beecham v. Burns*, 34 Cal. App. 754 [168 Pac. 1058], certain signers of a recall petition requested the clerk to withdraw their names therefrom after the petition had been filed with the clerk and before that officer had certified the result of his examination as required by the statute. The court held: "In our opinion, the signers of such petitions may not withdraw their names or have their names withdrawn by the clerk at any time after the petition has been filed."

Outside this state we find that the right of persons signing a petition to withdraw their names therefrom has frequently been before the courts of other jurisdictions. In the decided cases from other states we find many which are in accord with those from our own state above mentioned. In *Mohr v. Seattle*, 69 Wash. 68 [109 Pac. 309], it was held that under a charter provision that the city controller shall verify the sufficiency of the signatures to a referendum petition and imposing no duty upon the city council in that regard, it was the duty of the controller to determine the sufficiency of the signatures to the petition and after action had been taken by him no name might be withdrawn from the petition. In the case of *Sim v. Rosholt*, 16 N. D. 77 [11 L. R. A. (N. S.) 372, 112 N. W. 50], the supreme court of North Dec. 1926.] DOYLE v. JORDAN. 183

Dakota, after an examination of a large number of authorities upon the question of the right of a signer of a petition to withdraw therefrom, arrives at the following conclusion: "Upon examination it will be found that most of these cases relate to petitions for the removal of county seats, or are based upon a statute different from ours, and it will also be found that they do not support the right of petitioners to withdraw their names after the sufficiency of such petition and the qualifications of the petitioners have been passed upon by the board authorized to act thereunder. On the contrary, they will be found to support respondents' theory that, after the board has passed upon the sufficiency of such petition, it is thereafter too late to withdraw therefrom." In a note to this case found in 11 L. R. A. (N. S.), *supra*, we find it said that: "Even the cases which allow the most liberal margin of time for withdrawal seem to recognize that this right to withdraw may not be exercised so as to defeat the jurisdiction, after the jurisdiction of the body authorized to act has been determined." (Citing *Littrell v. Vermillion County*, 198 Ill. 205 [65 N. E. 78].) As against these authorities the *amici curiae* have cited but two California cases — *McAulay v. Board of Supervisors*, 178 Cal. 628 [174 Pac. 30], and *Covell v. Lee*, 71 Cal. App. 361 [235 Pac. 79]. In neither of these cases, however, were the withdrawals attempted to be made after the petition had been filed with the person or board whose duty it was to act thereon. In *McAulay v. Board of Supervisors*, *supra*, certain signers of a petition for the organization of an irrigation district asked to have their names withdrawn from said petition prior to the time said petition was to be presented to the board of supervisors. This court held that they could effectively withdraw their names therefrom. It will be observed, however, that said petition at the time of said withdrawal had never been presented to the board of supervisors, and accordingly it had never been passed upon by said board or by any officer whose duty it was to examine it and determine its sufficiency. In the case of *Covell v. Lee*, *supra*, the petition was one for the organization of a joint union high school district and was directed to the superintendent of schools as the law provided. It was signed by the required number of electors from each of the school districts to be included 184 DOYLE v. JORDAN. [200 Cal.

in the proposed high school district. Before the petition had been presented to the superintendent of schools, three electors from Plainfield School District (one of the districts to be included in said proposed union high school district), who had signed the original petition, signed written requests, addressed to the superintendent of schools, asking that their names be withdrawn from the petition. These written requests were presented to the superintendent of schools before the original petition was presented or filed with such officer. The superintendent of schools in computing the number of names signed to said petition rejected these three names, thus reducing the number of signers thereto from the Plainfield School District below the number required by law. The district court of appeal, upon the authority of McAulay v. Board of Supervisors, supra, sustained the action of the superintendent of schools in rejecting said three names and held that they had a right to withdraw from said petition. It will be observed that in this case, like the case of McAulay v. Board of Supervisors, supra, the signers seeking to withdraw from the petition presented their request for withdrawal before the petition had been presented to the officer whose duty it was to act thereon and, of course, before said officer had taken any action to determine the sufficiency of the same. A large number of cases from other jurisdictions are cited by the amici curiae in support of the right of the signers to withdraw from petitions which they had previously signed. Many of these arose from statutes entirely unlike our own and in cases where the facts were so different from those in the present proceeding as to detract materially from their value as precedents to be followed in this action. From the study we have been able to give to these authorities we are forced to agree with the author of the note to Sim v. Rosholt, in 11 L. R. A. (N. S.), supra, wherein he stated: "Even the cases which allow the most liberal margin of time for withdrawal seem to recognize that this right to withdraw may not be exercised so as to defeat the jurisdiction, after the jurisdiction of the body authorized to act has been determined."

The record in the present proceedings shows that the ordinances passed by the boards of supervisors of Del Norte, Mendocino, Sonoma, Napa, and Marin and by the board of supervisors of the city and county of San Francisco had Dec. 1926.] DOYLE v. JORDAN. 185

all been passed and petitions in compliance with these ordinances had all been circulated and signed by electors of said counties, respectively, and that all said petitions had been presented to the county clerks of the respective counties and to the registrar of voters of said city and county, and that these officers had certified that the petitions presented to them, respectively, were sufficient and that said ordinances and the said petitions with the certificates of the certifying officers attached thereto had all been filed in the office of the respondent, the Secretary of State, and also that the affidavits of the nonpassage of ordinances in the counties of Humboldt and Lake had been filed in the office of the respondent, before the board of supervisors of Mendocino County had adopted the resolution declaring it not for the best interests of Mendocino County to join in said proposed district and before the board of supervisors of said county had taken any action to repeal or rescind their former ordinance of intention to join said district, and before any copy of said resolution or any copy of said repealing ordinance or before the petition signed by the 180 electors of Mendocino County asking to have their names withdrawn from the original petition had been filed in the office of respondent. To state the matter more briefly, by December 25, 1925, all steps required by the statute to be taken by either the boards of supervisors or the electors of the counties embraced within the boundaries of the proposed district had been taken by said boards of supervisors and by said electors and all the papers, documents, and instruments required by said act to be presented to the respondent in order to require him to publish the notice demanded of him in said proceeding had been presented to and filed by respondent in his said office. It therefore became the duty of respondent upon receipt by him of said documents to publish said notice as required by the statute. Upon the receipt by him of said documents he acquired jurisdiction to proceed under said statute and to perform the duties required of him by the terms thereof. Any attempt thereafter of any of the original signers of any of said petitions to withdraw therefrom, according to the great weight of authority, was ineffectual and could not divest respondent of jurisdiction to proceed as directed by the statute. The first of the documents, whereby Mendocino County sought to withdraw from said district, that was filed 186 DOYLE v. JORDAN. [200 Cal.

in the office of respondent was the certified copy of the resolution adopted by the board of supervisors of said county on December 15, 1925, and it was filed in the office of respondent December 17, 1925. Thereafter there was filed with respondent two certified copies of the ordinance passed by the board of supervisors of Mendocino County, whereby they attempted to repeal the ordinance declaring it the intention of said county to join in said district, and on January 21, 1926, the request signed by 180 of the persons on the original petition from said county attempting to withdraw their names from said original petition was filed with respondent. Under these facts and circumstances we are forced to the conclusion that the attempt by the signers of said petition to withdraw therefrom after said petition had been certified to as sufficient by the county clerk and thereafter filed with respondent was too late and was therefore ineffectual for any purpose whatever.

[2] The same conclusion must be reached, we think, in regard to the attempt of the board of supervisors to repeal the resolution of intention to join said district. "There is, . . . a distinction between the permanent or continuing powers of the board and those that are to be exercised once for all for a specified occasion only, as in the proceedings of the kind before us; for in the latter case the power to repeal the act after it had been finally executed is from the nature of the case clearly excluded." (Vernon v. Board of Supervisors, 142 Cal. 513, 516 [76 Pac. 253].) Continuing, the court in this case says: "there is no longer any power to rescind, and this, for the double reason that the powers granted to the board have been exhausted, and that vested rights have accrued." The court in the Vernon case was considering the right of a board of supervisors to rescind a resolution defining the boundaries of a proposed town and providing for an election to determine whether the territory included within said boundaries should be incorporated under the Municipal Corporation Act. It held that the board's action rescinding its resolution providing for said election was valid, as it had been taken before the election was held and under a misapprehension of the real facts before the board at the time of its passage. We refer to this case more particularly for the reason that it brings out clearly the distinction between the general powers of a Dec. 1926.] DOYLE v. JORDAN. 187

board of supervisors as to the enactment and repeal of ordinances and those that are exercised in proceedings of the kind before us. The board of supervisors of the county of Mendocino having passed the ordinance required by the statute and the petition provided for by said ordinance having been circulated, signed, certified, and presented to the respondent (which proceedings might be compared with the holding of an election under the Municipal Corporation Act), it was then too late for said board to repeal said ordinance. The powers granted it under the statute had become exhausted. [3] Nor do we think that there is any merit in the further contention of the *amici curiae* that the passage by the board of supervisors of Ordinance Number 220, declaring it to be the intention of said county to join the bridge and highway district, is but an offer or proposal on the part of the county and that it may be withdrawn or revoked at any time before its acceptance. [4] Conceding it to be an offer or proposal only, it was according to statute and made "to unite with such other counties as may adopt like ordinances." As we have already seen, four of the above counties and the city and county of San Francisco adopted like ordinances as that passed by the board of supervisors of Mendocino County, and following the passage of said ordinances they took all proceedings required of them by said statute in order to join said bridge and highway district. The offer, therefore, made by the county of Mendocino was fully accepted by the other counties to whom it was made and the attempt of the board of supervisors to withdraw the same thereafter was too late and accordingly ineffectual. [5] The additional contention of the *amici curiae* is also untenable, that is, that the offer was made to join a district composed of eight counties, including Humboldt and Lake Counties, and that as these two last-named counties refused to join in said district it was impossible to accept the offer as tendered. The ordinance passed by the county of Mendocino purported on its face to have been enacted in accordance with the act of the legislature providing for the incorporation of bridge and highway districts, the second section of which provides that: "The several boards of supervisors of said counties or parts of counties, may adopt an ordinance to the effect that the county, or part of county, intends to unite with such other counties as may adopt like ordi- 188 DOYLE v. JORDAN. [200 Cal.

uances to form such district, . . . ." The legal effect of the ordinance passed by the board of supervisors of the county of Mendocino was that it intended to unite, in the language of the statute, "with such other counties as may adopt like ordinances." It was clearly the intention of the board of supervisors to adopt an ordinance in compliance with the terms of the statute. In our opinion the ordinance adopted by them met these requirements. Its offer then was to unite with such other counties as might adopt similar ordinances. It was not impossible to accept said offer so long as any one or more of said counties passed a similar ordinance, and the passage of such ordinance by any of said other counties was of itself an acceptance of said offer of Mendocino County to join in said district.

[6] The amici curiae claim that the proceedings taken by the respective counties to incorporate said bridge and highway district are fatally defective in that they fail to set forth or describe the project for which the district was proposed to be incorporated. It is true that the project for which it is proposed to form the district is not set forth nor mentioned in either the ordinance passed by the board of supervisors or in the petition circulated and signed by the electors. Nothing in the act provides that the project for which it is proposed to form the district shall be set forth in any particular or specified manner or shall be described or contained in any particular or specified document or instrument which may form a part of the proceedings taken for the incorporation of the district. By section 13 of the act it is made the duty, after the organization of the district, of the board of directors and other officers of the district, "to prepare plans, both engineering and financial, for the purpose of putting into operation the project for which the district has been organized," and in section 14 of said act it is further provided, "that no taxes shall be levied by the board under the provisions of this section for the purpose of carrying out new projects after the original project for which the district was formed has been completed." It would appear from these sections that the project for which the district is formed should be definitely designated somewhere in the proceedings in order, at least, that the board of directors of the district might know the extent and the limits to which they might proceed after the organi- Dec. 1926.] DOYLE v. JORDAN. 189

zation of said district. In fact, the object and purpose of the district, or its project, is a matter of first importance to all electors of the counties embraced within its limits. While it is true that the project is not set forth either in the ordinance or in the petition, yet it is claimed by petitioners that it sufficiently appears elsewhere in the proceedings. By section 3 of said act it is provided that: "The said ordinance (referring to the ordinance of intention to join the district) may be enacted by the board of supervisors at any time after application shall be made to them for such purpose, . . . " It is alleged in the amended petition, and not denied in the answer and return, that written applications were filed with the board of supervisors of each of the counties and of the city and county originally intended to be included within the boundaries of the proposed district and "That said applications and each of them definitely designated the bridging of the Golden Gate as the object and purpose for which a bridge and highway district was to be formed." It is further alleged by petitioners, and not denied, that it was in response to these written applications that the boards of supervisors of the respective counties and of the city and county passed the ordinances declaring it to be the intention of said counties and of said city and county to join in the organization of said district. It will thus be seen that there is officially of record in each of the counties of said district a document among the proceedings to incorporate said district in which the object and purpose of the project for which said district was to be formed is definitely and distinctly set forth. This, we think, is all that is required under the statute. It will be seen from an examination of the terms of the statute that no directions are contained therein requiring that the project for which said district is to be formed shall be stated either in the ordinance to be passed by the supervisors or in the petition to be circulated and signed by the electors. The boards of supervisors of the respective counties were by the written applications filed with them duly and sufficiently apprised of the project contemplated for the formation of the district. The petitions signed by the electors of the respective counties contained a prayer for the incorporation of a district under the provisions of said statute "to be known as the 190 DOYLE v. JORDAN. [200 Cal.

Golden Gate Bridge and Highway District." Conceding that this was no notice to them that the project of the proposed district was to bridge the Golden Gate, it was sufficient to put them upon inquiry as to the real project contemplated by the incorporation of said district, and from the fact that they signed the petition it must be assumed that they satisfied themselves of the nature of said project and that they favored their county joining in said district. While we consider that it would have been the better practice to have had the project of the proposed district set out either in the ordinance or in the petition or both, yet we are not prepared to say that the failure to so set it out or to refer to it in said ordinance or petition renders the proceedings invalid so long as such project is set forth in full and shown in the written applications on file with the boards of supervisors of the counties to which they were presented.

[7] Various constitutional grounds are urged against the validity of the statute providing for the incorporation of bridge and highway districts. Among these grounds are that, by the terms of the statute, it seeks to deprive persons of their property without due process of law and that it seeks to take private property for private use. It is also contended that more than one subject is embraced within the title of said statute. We do not think that there is any merit in any of these contentions, nor do we feel that any extended answer thereto would serve any useful purpose.

[8] A further objection urged against the validity of the statute upon constitutional grounds deals mainly with the provision thereof defining the duties of boards of directors of said districts and particularly with the powers given to said boards by the statute to levy and collect taxes. It is claimed that as the directors of said district are appointed by the boards of supervisors of the counties composing said district and are not elected by the electors of said counties that they have no power to levy taxes. Even assuming that this point is well taken and that the attempt to clothe the directors of said district with power to levy taxes is beyond the constitutional authority of the legislature, yet we seriously doubt whether this question can be raised in this proceeding instituted for the sole purpose of testing the validity of those provisions of the act providing for the incorporation and formation of said district. The district when incorpo- Dec. 1926.] DOYLE v. JORDAN. 191

rated may be a valid and constitutional agency of the state, although some of the powers with which the legislature may have sought to invest the directors thereof are invalid and unconstitutional. The result would be that in a proper proceeding the court might restrain any attempt on the part of said directors to exercise such illegal and unlawful powers. But these illegal provisions, if any such there are in the statute, present no good ground why the district should not be incorporated, nor will they affect the legality of the district when incorporated. It may be that a board of directors formed as contemplated by the statute would be without power to levy taxes as provided in said act. If this would hereafter be made to appear, undoubtedly the legislature could, and probably would, provide for some different manner or means of raising taxes in the district, or possibly might provide for the election of said directors by a direct vote of the electors of the respective counties. This would be a mere defect in the machinery of the district and could be cured by proper legislation. It could not be held to invalidate the proceedings taken under the statute to incorporate the district. [9] The same may be said in regard to the objection that there is no provision in the statute providing for the equalization of the assessments of property in the different counties. If by the failure to provide for the equalization of assessments it should be held that any levy of taxes sought to be imposed by the directors of the district was illegal, this defect in the statute could be remedied by proper legislation to be thereafter enacted. In our opinion, therefore, there is no relevancy in any of these objections in so far as they are made or relied upon for the purpose of invalidating or rendering unconstitutional the provisions of the statute providing for the incorporation of such district. It is, therefore, unnecessary for us to express any opinion as to the validity of those provisions of the statute conferring upon the board of directors of said district power to levy and collect taxes nor the effect upon said statute of its failure to provide for the equalization of the assessments of property in the various counties of said district. These are matters not properly before us in this proceeding.

[10] The final contention of the amici curiae is that the act in question is unconstitutional in that it is violative of 192 LANGFORD v. THOMAS. [200 Cal.

article XI, section 13 of the constitution. Practically the same question was raised to the validity of statutes creating sanitary districts and county water districts as is now raised by the *amici curiae* against the constitutionality of the bridge and highway act. In each case it was held that the statute in question did not violate the above provisions of the constitution (*Woodward v. Fruitvale Sanitary Dist.*, 99 Cal. 554 [34 Pac. 239]; *Henshaw v. Foster*, 176 Cal. 507 [169 Pac. 82]). We can see no valid distinction between the questions involved and decided in those cases and that raised by the *amici curiae*, in the present proceeding under their final contention as to the constitutionality of the bridge and highway act. Upon the authority of these cases we have no hesitancy in holding that the statute under consideration does not violate article XI, section 13, of the constitution of this state.

It is therefore ordered that the peremptory writ issue as prayed for.

[1] AGENCY—OBLIGATIONS OF AGENT—VIOLATION OF TRUST.—The law of California imposes on a real estate agent the same obligation of undivided service and loyalty that it imposes on a trustee in favor of his beneficiary; and violation of his trust is subject to the same punitory consequences that are provided for a disloyal or recreant trustee.

[2] Id.—INTEREST OF AGENT ADVERSE TO PRINCIPAL—DUTY TO DISCLOSE. Under the statute, a party in his proposed employment as a real estate agent by other parties is barred from acceptance of employment, unless he discloses to his proposed principal the facts which may be adverse to the interest of the latter and after such disclosure is permitted by them to act as their agent.

[3] Id.—EXCHANGE OF PROPERTIES—SECRET PROFITS—LIABILITY OF AGENT TO PRINCIPAL.—Where a real estate agent accepted employment to exchange real property owned by his principals and consummated an exchange for property which he himself owned, subject to a contract of sale to other parties, which contract he procured a release from for a consideration, he is liable to his principals for secret profits made by him on the transaction, where he did not disclose the fact that he was the owner of the property being exchanged to his principals.

[4] Id.—ACTION TO RECOVER SECRET PROFITS.—In this action by principals to recover secret profits alleged to have been made by their agent in an exchange of properties for them, it is held that the third amended complaint stated a cause of action and the court did not err in overruling a demurrer to it or denying a motion to strike out portions thereof.

[5] Id.—VALUE OF LAND—IMMATERIALITY OF.—In an action against an agent for breach of trust and to recover secret profits obtained by him as a result of the agency relationship in the exchange of property of his principals for property owned by him, the value of the land is immaterial, as the principals are entitled to recover from the agent the difference between the price of the land purchased by him for them and the amount paid by the principals.

[6] Id.—ISSUES—FINDINGS.—Where the complaint in such an action alleges a cause of action arising from the false and fraudulent representations and concealments of the agent by which the principals were led to believe that they were dealing with third parties, when in fact they were dealing with the agent, upon which issues the court found in favor of the plaintiffs, issues raised by further allegations of the complaint touching the agent's representations as to the acreage of the land received by the principals and the amount of personal property thereon were immaterial and findings thereon unnecessary, as the judgment would not in any way be affected by findings on immaterial issues.

[7] Id.—EVIDENCE—LETTERS FROM AGENT TO PRINCIPALS.—In such a case, there was no error in excluding letters written by the agent to the principals requesting the latter to visit the former in order to adjust any grievance that might exist, where the letters were written long after the consummation of the transaction.

George H. Stone and Glen H. Munkelt for Appellants.

Hamilton & Lindley for Respondents.

SULLIVAN, J.—This is an appeal from a judgment in favor of plaintiffs for $2,136.99 and costs against the defendants for damages for violation of their duty as real estate agents during the period of their employment as such by plaintiffs.

The case was tried by the court without a jury and findings were filed covering all material issues by the trial judge on November 25, 1924, the date of the entry of judgment in the superior court of San Diego County.

The facts, as stated in the complaint on which the cause was tried, as found by the trial court and as thoroughly established by evidence at the trial, may be summarized as follows:

1. On March 1, 1923, Ada C. Langford and Norton Langford, husband and wife, were the owners of a lot situated at

9. Right to retain property and recover from broker the amount of secret profits, note, 34 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1211. See, also, 4 R. C. L. 278. Dec. 1926.] LANGFORD v. THOMAS. 195

1505 Lewis Street, in the city of San Diego, referred to throughout the record as the "Lewis street property."

The value of the property at the time, as found by the court, was $8,000. It was subject to a mortgage for $3,250, making the net value of the property of the Langfords at that time $4,750.

The negotiations on the Langfords' part were conducted mainly by the wife.

2. J. F. Thomas at the time was conducting business as a real estate agent in the city of San Diego under the name of "The Crescent Realty Company," a defunct corporation.

3. On March 1, 1923, the Langfords, desiring to secure a chicken ranch and to make use of the Lewis Street property, in whole or in part, in securing the new property, employed Thomas as a real estate agent to conduct negotiations for them, Thomas accepting the employment and undertaking to effect a desirable exchange. Neither then nor at any time during the negotiations resulting in the exchange of properties did Thomas suggest any disqualifying or adversary interest on his part which might prevent his undivided service and loyalty as agent for the Langfords. At no time did, Thomas inform the Langfords, or either of them, that "he or anyone for whom he" was acting as agent had "an interest present or contingent adverse to that of his beneficiary," the Langfords. (See secs. 2230 and 2322, Civ. Code.)

As a matter of fact, at the time of making the engagement to act as agent for the Langfords, Thomas was disqualified to assume such agency, both by his own personal interest and his interest as agent for the Malletts in the Chula Vista chicken ranch.

4. As a result of the activities of Thomas assuming to act for all concerned, the Langfords parted with their equity in the Lewis Street property, worth $4,750, gave their note for $4,500, secured by mortgage on the chicken ranch, and paid off a street assessment lien of $121.99, due from Thomas or the Malletts, or both, on the chicken ranch. The aggregate cost to the Langfords to secure the Chula Vista chicken ranch was $9,371.99. The aggregate cost to Thomas of the chicken ranch deeded by him to the Langfords at the price of $9,371.99 was $7,235, made up of items which we shall presently state. 196 LANGFORD v. THOMAS. [200 Cal.

The difference between this latter amount and the price obtained from the Langfords was $2,136.99, for which amount the trial court gave judgment to the plaintiffs.

5. The Chula Vista chicken ranch, on March 1, 1923, when Thomas, as agent for the Langfords, engaged to negotiate an exchange of the Lewis Street property for a chicken ranch, was the property of Thomas subject to a contract of sale made by him on September 14, 1920, with Mildred Mallett and W. H. Mallett, under which he was to convey the same for a price of $6,250. On March 1, 1923, the balance due on the sale contract from Mallett and wife to Thomas was $3,500. To secure a release of the contract right of the Malletts in the Chula Vista chicken ranch, Thomas canceled his claim for the $3,500 unpaid balance and paid to the Malletts an additional sum of $3,735—making a total cost to Thomas of the ranch, $7,235.

Without burdening this opinion with all the details of the one transaction set out in the third amended complaint, we may say that Thomas as trustee for the Langfords violated his duty (a) by nondisclosure of his disqualification owing to his antecedent and continued ownership of the Chula Vista chicken ranch, (b) by his agency for the Malletts, (c) by concealment and suppression of essential facts likely to affect the action of the Langfords, (d) by misrepresentation and such other fraudulent device as would aid him in securing for himself the Lewis Street property in San Diego and getting rid of the chicken ranch with its lien of $121.99.

[1] The law of California imposed on Thomas, the real estate agent, the same obligation of undivided service and loyalty that it imposes on a trustee in favor of his beneficiary. Violation of his trust is subject to the same punitory consequences that are provided for a disloyal or recreant trustee. (King v. Wise, 43 Cal. 628.) The case cited was one of secret profits realized by an agent out of a transaction handled by him for the benefit of two associates and himself in a common enterprise.

Justice Niles in 1872, speaking for an undivided court, declared that "By the terms of the original agreement between the defendant and the plaintiffs, Crossett and King, the defendant was to purchase the land for the least price for which it could be purchased, and for the benefit of the three parties concerned. Dec. 1926.] LANGFORD v. THOMAS. 197

"By this agreement the defendant assumed a position of trust, and in that relation was bound to exercise the utmost good faith towards his associates in the transaction. It is one of the plainest principles of equity that an agent cannot make a profit out of his principal in the business of his agency. The defendant, as associate of the plaintiffs in the proposed purchase, and entrusted by them with its management, was held to the same good faith, and could make no bargain, the benefits of which his co-associates would not be entitled to share."

The Civil Code enacted at the legislative session of the same year (1872) crystallized the adjudicated law of earlier days into statutory form as Civil Code sections declaring the rules for the government of agents and trustees in their dealings with principals and beneficiaries. Section 2322 of the Civil Code as then enacted and still in force provided that "An authority expressed in general terms, however broad, does not authorize an agent . . . (3) to do any act which a trustee is forbidden to do by article two, chapter one of the last title."

In the article and chapter thus referred to we find section 2230 of the Civil Code, which contains the following inhibition upon the activities of trustees: "Neither a trustee nor any of his agents may take part in any transaction concerning the trust in which he, or anyone for whom he acts as agent has an interest, present or contingent, adverse to that of his beneficiary except as follows: (1) When the beneficiary having capacity to contract with a full knowledge of the motives of the trustee and of all other facts concerning the transaction which might affect his own decision and without the use of any influence on the part of the trustee permits him to do so . . . ." (Italics ours.)

[2] Under the statutory rule thus laid down for Thomas in his proposed employment as a real estate agent by the Langfords he was barred from acceptance of the employment, unless he disclosed all the facts to the Langfords and after such disclosure was permitted by them to act as their agent.

The law as laid down in these code sections has been frequently interpreted and applied. The case of *Calmon v. Sarraille*, 142 Cal. 638 [76 Pac. 486], decided in 1904, is 198 LANGFORD v. THOMAS. [200 Cal.

instructive. It was held in that case, as shown in subdivision 1 of the syllabus, as follows:

"Principal and Agent--Fiduciary Relation--Duty of Agent--Advantage Over Principal.--The relation of an agent to his principal is of a fiduciary nature, and not only imposes upon the agent the highest good faith toward the principal, but precludes him from obtaining any advantage over him in any transaction had by virtue of his agency."

In the opinion in the same case at page 641 we find the following:

"The relation between Garnier and the plaintiffs was of a fiduciary nature, and not only imposed upon Garnier the duty of acting in the highest good faith towards the plaintiffs, but precluded him from obtaining any advantage over them in any transaction had by virtue of his agency. Subdivision 3 of section 2322 of the Civil Code, forbids an agent from doing 'any act which a trustee is forbidden to do' under sections 2228, 2231 of the Civil Code. Section 2228 declares that 'In all matters connected with his trust, a trustee is bound to act in the highest good faith toward his beneficiary, and may not obtain any advantage therein over the latter by . . . concealment'; and section 2231 declares that 'A trustee may not use the influence which his position gives him to obtain any advantage from his beneficiary.' (See, also, Story on Agency, sec. 211; Mechem on Agency, sec. 470; Bunker v. Miles, 30 Me. 431 [50 Am. Dec. 632]; King v. Wise, 43 Cal. 628; Rubidoex v. Parks, 48 Cal. 215; Burke v. Bourz, 92 Cal. 108 [28 Pac. 57]; Sterling v. Smith, 97 Cal. 343 [32 Pac. 320].)"

[3] Cases to like effect covering the intervening years might be multiplied indefinitely, but it would be a work of supererogation. Thomas by his own showing under the circumstances attending his conduct became answerable as an unfaithful trustee for any benefits, profits, or advantages realized by him.

[4] A brief reference to the eleven specific grounds for reversal urged by the appellants may be proper.

I. The trial court overruled a demurrer to the third amended complaint and denied a motion to strike out certain portions thereof. Appellants insist that the third amended complaint did not state a cause of action. As we read Dec. 1926.] LANGFORD v. THOMAS. 199

the complaint in the light of the law applicable as above stated the ground is not tenable.

Neither do we find reversible error in the ruling of the court on the same demurrer on the grounds of uncertainty or misjoinder of causes of action.

II. Appellants here contend that their motion to strike certain portions of the complaint was improperly denied. As stated in appellants' brief, the motion was made so as "to eliminate all allegations which tend to present two causes of action."

The complaint detailed but one transaction and stated but one cause of action. The motion to strike was properly denied.

III. For a third contention the appellants urge that the court below erred in excluding testimony touching the value of the Mallett chicken ranch.

[5] In an action against an agent for breach of trust and to recover a secret profit obtained by said agent as a result of the agency relationship the authorities are to the effect that the value of the land is immaterial on the ground that "The plaintiffs should have from the defendant the difference between the price of the land purchased by him for the plaintiffs and the amount paid by the plaintiffs." (King v. Wise, 43 Cal. 628, 634; Calmon v. Sarraille, 142 Cal. 638, 642 [76 Pac. 486].)

IV. As their fourth point the appellants contend that the trial court erred in excluding certain offered testimony of the agency of Thomas for the Malletts, insisting that "There is no objection to a dual agency if both parties are advised of the situation."

What we have said in the earlier part of this opinion disposes of the contention. The record herein fails to establish that the Langfords were informed of and consented to Thomas acting as the agent of the Malletts.

[6] V. Alleged failure of the trial court to find on material issues. We cannot say that the trial court failed "to find upon the material issues as framed by the pleadings." As we read the complaint, it alleges a cause of action arising from the false and fraudulent representations and concealments of Thomas by which the respondents were led to believe that they were dealing with the Malletts when in fact they were dealing with Thomas. The record re- 200 LANGFORD v. THOMAS. [200 Cal.
veals that the court below found upon all the material issues presented by said cause of action. The issues raised by the further allegations of the complaint touching appellants' representations as to the acreage of the chicken ranch and the amount of personal property thereon were immaterial and findings thereon unnecessary. The judgment entered would not in any way be affected by findings on said immaterial issues. (Sharp v. Pitman, 166 Cal. 501, 505 [137 Pac. 234].)

[7] VI. It is here urged that the lower court erred in excluding two letters addressed by the appellant Thomas to one of the respondents requesting that the latter visit the former in order to adjust any grievance that might exist.

We cannot see the materiality of the evidence and conclude that it was properly excluded. The letters involved were written long after the consummation of the transaction out of which this action arose and merely requested a meeting of the parties to adjust grievances. In addition, the letters contain many laudatory and self-serving declarations.

[8] VII, VIII, IX, X. We are of the opinion that the several findings complained of under the above headings are amply supported by the evidence. As already indicated, the evidence tends to show that the appellant Thomas by his conduct and activity, in effect, succeeded in substituting himself as principal in the place and stead of the Malletta. Any conflict in the evidence upon the issues covered by the findings complained of must be resolved in favor of said findings.

[9] XI. The final ground urged by the appellants for reversal is that the court erred in the measure of damages awarded to the respondents. This matter has been fully covered by us in the preceding pages of this opinion. In our opinion the trial court properly held Thomas answerable to his employers for the full amount of his secret profits realized on the one transaction which he, as their agent and trustee, conducted for them as principals and beneficiaries of the trust.

For the foregoing reasons the judgment appealed from is hereby affirmed.

CURTIS, J.—Respondent is the duly elected and qualified county clerk of the county of Imperial, having been elected to that position at the general election held in November, 1922. He qualified as such officer and entered upon the discharge of his duties on the first Monday in January, 1923, and has ever since continued to fill said office and to discharge the duties thereof. On the fifteenth day of January, 1923, the board of supervisors of said county appointed or employed him to act as county purchasing agent and fixed his compensation for the services to be performed under said appointment at the sum of fifty dollars per month. He accepted such employment and discharged the duties required

1. See 22 R. C. L. 535. 202 MOUSSEAU v. GAREY. [200 Cal.

by him thereunder up to the first day of June, 1923. His salary was paid for the first three months of his employment, but the appellant, the duly elected, qualified, and acting auditor of said county, refused to allow respondent's demands for salary for the months of April and May, 1923. Thereupon respondent instituted this proceeding in *mandamus* to compel appellant to issue warrants in payment of respondent's services as purchasing agent for the months of April and May, 1923. There is no dispute as to any of the facts in the case and the only question presented for decision is one of law, and that is whether the respondent while occupying the office of, and drawing the salary as county clerk of said county can legally accept other employment from said county and be paid therefor from the public funds of said county.

The county of Imperial belongs to the seventeenth class and the salary of the county clerk of said county at the date of respondent's election to said office as fixed by section 4246 of the Political Code was the sum of two thousand four hundred dollars per annum. By section 4290 of the same code it is provided that: "The salaries and fees provided in this title shall be in full compensation for all services of every kind and description rendered by the officers named in this title either as officers or *ex-officio* officers, their deputies and assistants, unless in this title otherwise provided, . . ." By subdivision 21 of section 4041 of the Political Code, the board of supervisors is given authority to appoint a purchasing agent. This section was in force at the time of plaintiff's election. Therefore, the duties of the purchasing agent were at no time any part of the duties to be performed by the plaintiff as county clerk of said county. The board of supervisors had no authority to require plaintiff in his official capacity to perform these duties. Whoever the board appointed purchasing agent would perform the duties of his office as purchasing agent and not in any other capacity. When, therefore, plaintiff was appointed to this position and entered upon the discharge of the duties of purchasing agent, he performed said duties not as county clerk of said county or as *ex-officio* county clerk. The salary paid him as purchasing agent was not paid him for services rendered either as county clerk or *ex-officio* county clerk of said county. Dec. 1926.] · MOUSSEAU v. GAREY. 203

Had plaintiff resigned his office as county clerk the next day after his appointment as purchasing agent said resignation would have had no effect upon his position as purchasing agent and he would have continued to discharge the duties of said last-named position so long as the board of supervisors continued him in such employment. [1] Therefore, section 4290 of the Political Code, providing that the salaries therein provided shall be in full compensation of all services rendered by county officers either as officers or *ex-officio* officers, has no application to the compensation paid plaintiff for services which had no connection with, and which were entirely independent, of his duties as county clerk. This section does not attempt to deal with the question as to whether county officers can or cannot perform services for their respective counties outside of their official duties and be compensated for such services. It certainly contained no provision prohibiting a county officer from performing services on behalf of his county other than his official duties and to receive compensation for such services, and our attention has not been called, nor have we been able to discover, any other statute of the state which makes such prohibition. It is true that there is language to be found in the case of *County of Humboldt v. Stern*, 136 Cal. 63 [68 Pac. 324], which might support such a contention, but a careful reading of this case, we think, will convince anyone that such language was not necessary for its decision and that it is mere dictum. Accordingly, we find nothing either in the statutes or in the decisions of the courts of this state that made the plaintiff ineligible to the position of purchasing agent. Having been appointed to such position by the board of supervisors, who are specially authorized to make said appointment, we see no legal reason why he is not entitled to receive the compensation agreed to be paid him for his services in said position.

The judgment is affirmed.

Tanner, Odell & Taft for Appellant.

Roy V. Rhodes and Wilbur Bassett for Respondents.

WASTE, C. J.—Plaintiff brought an action to foreclose a written contract in the nature of a mortgage for the construction of a building for the defendants and respondents. Prior to the commencement of the action, defendants made

2. See 24 Cal. Jur. 943.
3. See 25 Cal. Jur. 927. Dec. 1926.] CHESTER R. PYLE CO. v. FOSSLER. 205

an offer in writing to pay plaintiff the sum of $1,000, in addition to the sum of $2,500 theretofore paid, in satisfaction of any and all claims under the contract. The offer, accompanied by a sufficient tender, was refused, and the defendants subsequently paid the money into court. The trial court, by its judgment, decreed that plaintiff take nothing by the action, save and except the sum of $1,000, and that the defendants recover their costs. [1] From this judgment the plaintiff appealed, citing insufficiency of the evidence, lack of proper findings, and errors of law occurring at the trial.

The appellant is a corporation carrying on a general contracting and building business. During the year 1918 the defendants, a mother and four daughters, sold their home in Nebraska and came to California, the mother, Mrs. Kate Fossler, about seventy-five years of age, and ill and weak, and two daughters, planning to live here. They had received $5,000 from the sale of the Nebraska property, which was all the money they had. With this modest amount to invest, they sought to buy a home in Pasadena. While in search of such an investment, and looking at houses already built, they came in contact with the appellant. One of its agents suggested to defendants that, instead of buying a home already constructed, they purchase a lot for $2,000, and erect thereon a house and garage similar to one already constructed with which they were familiar. He assured them that the desired structure could be built for a sum not to exceed $3,000. Acting on the advice of plaintiff, through its agent, the defendants purchased the lot, and agreed with the plaintiff that it should erect thereon a dwelling-house, garage, and other improvements "at a cost of approximately $3,000."

A contract was thereupon prepared by the plaintiff and submitted to the defendants. It provided that whereas the defendants had agreed to hire, and contract with the plaintiff to erect a dwelling-house, garage, and other improvements, the defendants would furnish the money therefor, in specified payments, the plaintiff to furnish all things required to complete a "one-story dwelling including an attic, a garage and such other improvements" as might be ordered by the defendants, "according to plans and specifications 206 CHESTER R. PYLE Co. v. FOSSLER. [200 Cal.

and drawings" to be prepared by the plaintiff, "and agreed upon, and when agreed upon to be signed and approved by at least three of the" defendants. The contract further provided that the defendants might, during the progress of the work, request alterations, additions to or omissions from the contract and plans and specifications, and also that, should the superintendent of construction order necessary changes or deviations, the same should in no way make void the contract, but any increased cost thereof should be added to the amount specified as the cost on which the compensation of the builder should be computed. By another stipulation, it was understood and agreed that the cost of the building and improvements ordered or contemplated in the contract and plans and specifications, or incurred by any changes made by the defendants, might be more than the amount specified in the contract, and, if so, the defendants should furnish the necessary money to complete the building, but the plaintiff should have the right to furnish any money at its option to construct and complete the improvements, all such amounts, so advanced, to be deemed secured by the contract, "as a lien on said premises in the nature of a mortgage." In consideration for any advancements and for its services, plaintiff was to be paid a sum equal to ten per cent of the cost of the building and improvements.

When the contract was presented for signing, the defendants called attention to the fact that it contained no provision as to the total maximum amount which the improvements would cost them, and did not provide that changes and alterations should be ordered in writing. The contract was thereupon taken away by plaintiff and when again presented contained the provision for the erection of "a dwelling-house and garage and other improvements at a cost of approximately $3000.00," and that all changes and alterations should be ordered in writing. Not "knowing anything about contracts," and desirous of being properly advised, the defendants requested the name of a lawyer, and were sent by plaintiff to its own attorney. The defendants did not know of the relation of the attorney to the plaintiff, and one of them went to him for advice. He advised that the contract "was all right," but does not Dec. 1926.] CHESTER R. PYLE CO. V. FOSSLER. 207

appear to have had any other connection with the transaction in its inception.

In apparent performance of the contract executed by the parties, the plaintiff erected a dwelling-house and garage on the lot of the defendants, but departed widely from the plans and specifications first presented to the defendants, and demanded payment for the completed improvements in the sum of $12,118.39. The defendants claim that then, for the first time, they learned that they were not getting a house and garage at a cost of approximately $3,000. On this point the evidence is contradictory. Appellant's superintendent of construction, who drew the plans and specifications, and who appears to have conducted most of the negotiations with the defendants, testified that he showed the defendants plans for a six-room frame house, and told them that it could be built for approximately $3,000; that prior to the signing of the written agreement no plans had been perfected and no specifications had been drawn; that plaintiff a week later submitted a pencil sketch of plans for a frame building, and he was told to prepare plans along the lines shown on it; that certain changes in the sketch were suggested by the defendants; plans and specifications were subsequently prepared by him; that he frequently talked with defendants during the construction, and told them "that changes would cost more money than what the contract called for." In this connection, however, it must be borne in mind that the defendants were at all times planning and thinking in terms of improvements to cost approximately $3,000, all the money they had. They had been shown such a house by appellant's superintendent. He prepared a pencil sketch, apparently of a house that could be erected for that sum. On the witness-stand he admitted that he gave defendants no figures regarding the cost of the house finally settled upon, and shown on the blue-prints furnished by him. There is evidence on the part of the defendants that when the changes from the pencil sketch were talked over, appellant's superintendent assured the defendants that appellant had on hand some old or "left over material," by the use of which the house finally decided upon could be built within the original estimate. The evidence is in sharp conflict as to what was said and done 208 CHESTER R. PYLE CO. V. FOSSLER. [200 Cal.
by the parties in relation to changes made after the plans were signed, and during the progress of the work.

The findings appear to have been made largely in response to the issues raised by the third and special defense interposed by the defendants. The court found that the officers and agents of the plaintiff were skilled and experienced in the building business, and were accustomed to drawing and entering into contracts similar to that entered into by the defendants; but, on the other hand, the defendants were without business experience or skill, and were without knowledge regarding the erection of buildings and improvements or the cost thereof, or the matter of contracts similar to that entered into by them. As shown by the testimony of defendants' experts, the improvements, as originally planned, would probably have cost $6,000, and, as finally completed, should have cost approximately $8,000. The evidence clearly shows that had these facts been known to the defendants they would not have entered into the contract. During all the preliminary negotiations they made it plain that they would not do so if the cost to them should exceed the sum of approximately $3,000. It is equally clear that they would not have contemplated costly additions to and changes in the work. The court also found that, in entering into the contract, the defendants believed and relied on the representations of plaintiff that the improvements contemplated by them would be built for the sum of approximately $3,000, and that prior to the time at which the improvements were substantially completed plaintiff did not inform or disclose to defendants, nor did defendants have any knowledge that the total cost of construction, according to the plans and specifications made and first approved by them, or as subsequently modified, would exceed the agreed sum of approximately $3,000. The court also found the defendants did not order in writing any changes or alterations in the plans previously agreed upon, and did not agree to any deviation from the plans and specifications as originally submitted to them, which they knew or believed would increase the cost of the improvements above the maximum price fixed by the contract. There is another finding that, before making the many changes in the character of the improvements, the plaintiff never made or furnished to the defendants any Dec. 1926.] CHESTER R. PYLE CO. v. FOSSLER. 209

estimate of the increased cost thereof, nor informed them that such changes from the plans and specifications would increase the total cost of construction, and the defendants understood and believed that the changes would not increase the cost of construction beyond the amount specified in the contract.

The trial court found, as the ultimate fact, that an additional sum of $500 over and above the sum of $3,000 was, "in contemplation of the provision in said contract that the dwelling-house, garage and improvements should be constructed at a cost of approximately three thousand dollars, . . . adequate, just and full compensation from defendants to plaintiff for all changes, alterations, additions to and deviations from said plans and specifications made by or with the consent of the defendants, or any of them, after said plans and specifications were approved"; and "that the total sum of thirty-five hundred dollars is adequate, just and full compensation for all sums due from defendants to plaintiff." The offer and tender of the defendants, and the subsequent deposit in court, being of the exact amount found due, the plaintiff was not entitled to its costs.

[2] The appellant advances a number of reasons why the judgment should be reversed. They are that the trial court failed to find the total cost of the building and improvements, or the cost of the various changes in construction, and did not find and allow it compensation at the rate of ten per cent of the cost, as provided in the contract, and did not find and allow it a reasonable attorney's fee for the prosecution of the action. It also argues that the trial court attempted to find the reasonable value of the improvements constructed, which, it contends, is not an issue presented by the pleadings. In answer, it need only be said that an omission to find upon an issue, when a finding would not necessitate any change in the judgment, does not warrant a reversal or a new trial. If findings are made upon issues which determine the case, other issues became immaterial, and a failure to find thereon does not constitute prejudicial error. (24 Cal. Jur., pp. 943, 944.) The probative and the ultimate facts here found properly and completely dispose of the material issues of this case. [3] The contention that the court did not find on an issue, raised by an amendment to

200 Cal.—14 210 MORRIS v. STANDARD OIL Co. [200 Cal.

the complaint, that the defendants waived the condition of the contract requiring deviations and changes to be ordered in writing, and consented that they be made, and accepted the benefits thereof, is answered by the findings taken as a whole. Waiver always rests upon intent and knowledge. There was, in this case, neither an express agreement nor such conduct on the part of the defendants, under the facts found, as would warrant an inference of any relinquishment on their part.

We have considered the various contentions of the appellant as to the sufficiency of the evidence, and the lack of appropriate findings, as well as the specifications of error in law occurring at the trial, and do not find that they warrant a new trial of the case.

The judgment is affirmed.

WASTE, C. J.—The main question to be determined on this appeal is whether or not a lien for the amount of the compensation paid an injured employee by the insurance carrier of the employer, and allowed under the provision of section 26 of the Workmen's Compensation Act [Stats. 1917, p. 854], against a judgment for personal injuries recovered by the employee against the person causing the injuries, is assignable.

4. See 3 Cal. Jur. 240. 212 MORRIS v. STANDARD OIL CO. [200 Cal.

Milton Morris, a minor, the plaintiff, was run over by a truck operated by the defendant, Standard Oil Company, and seriously injured while in the course of his employment by the Chronicle Publishing Company of Calexico. He brought an action against the Oil Company for damages for personal injuries, and, after two appeals to this court, he was awarded the sum of $12,000. (Morris v. Standard Oil Co., 188 Cal. 468 [205 Pac. 1073]; Ibid, 192 Cal. 343 [30 A. L. R. 1103, 219 Pac. 998].) The action was defended by the Ocean Accident and Guaranty Corporation, Limited, of London, England, which company was the insurance carrier of both the Oil Company and the minor's employer, the Chronicle Publishing Company. As compensation carrier for the employer, it supplied the injured boy with medical and hospital care, and paid to him disability indemnity during the existence of the disability arising from the injury, but refused to inform the employee of the items or the amounts expended for medical and hospital care. Consequently those expenditures were not given consideration in the action brought by the minor against the Oil Company. During the pendency of the second appeal in that action, the Industrial Accident Commission made an award to the injured employee, fixing the amount of compensation to be paid by the insurance carrier of the employer at the sum of $800.64, which amount the insurance company paid.

Neither the employer of the boy nor its insurance carrier joined, or was joined, in the action for damages brought by him against the Oil Company, and neither instituted an independent action against that company because of the injury. The Ocean Accident and Guaranty Corporation, as such insurance carrier, having paid the employee compensation for which his employer was liable, was subrogated to all rights of the employer, and was entitled to enforce such rights in its own name. (Workmen's Compensation Act, sec. 30, subd. 2 [f].) It therefore petitioned for a lien against the judgment obtained by the employee against the Oil Company for the amount paid by it as compensation and the additional sum paid for medical and hospital treatment. The application was denied as to the latter items, but the insurance carrier was allowed a lien against the judgment for the sum of $800.64, paid as compensation, Dec. 1926.] MORRIS v. STANDARD OIL CO. 213

upon the condition that it assigns to the employee any and all claims, demands, or causes of action it might have against the Oil Company for the amounts paid by it to the employee. No appeal was taken from this order allowing a conditional lien. The Oil Company, not having reimbursed the insurance company for the disability indemnity paid the employee, it complied with the order of the court and duly assigned its claim to him.

Thereafter, and while the second appeal in the action for damages hereinabove noted (192 Cal. 343 [30 A. L. R. 1103, 219 Pac. 998]) was pending, the parties entered into negotiations for settlement of the judgment there in question. As a result, a settlement was had whereby the Oil Company paid the injured minor the sum of $10,290.21, and agreed to, and did, secure from the insurance company and deliver to the employee a satisfaction and release of the lien, and also caused the company to assign to the employee, with full power to enforce the same, any cause of action it might have against the Standard Oil Company by reason of the indemnity judgment. The court approved the terms of the settlement, and the judgment against the Oil Company was thereupon satisfied and discharged. The Oil Company retained and presumably paid to the insurance company, the sum of $800.64 from the amount agreed to be paid by the Oil Company to the employee in satisfaction of the judgment. The Oil Company, refusing to acknowledge the legality of the assignment, or to pay the amount assigned, the employee, as assignee, instituted this suit, setting up the assignment and basing his cause of action thereon. Judgment was entered in his favor for the amount, interest, costs, and attorney's fees, and the Standard Oil Company has appealed.

[1] Appellant's first contention is that at the time its insurance carrier made the purported assignment to the employee it had no cause of action against the Oil Company. This contention is answered by the provision of the Workmen's Compensation Act (sec. 30, subd. 2 [f]) that, when an employer is insured against liability for compensation with an insurance carrier, and such carrier shall have paid any compensation for which the employer is liable, or furnished or provided any medical services required by the 214 MORRIS v. STANDARD OIL CO. [200 Cal.

act, such insurance carrier shall be subrogated to all the rights of the employer, and may enforce such rights in its own name. [2] The Ocean Accident and Guaranty Corporation, therefore, had a cause of action arising by way of subrogation or equitable assignment. (Dibble v. San Joaquin L. & P. Co., 47 Cal. App. 112, 117 [190 Pac. 198].) The cause of action was assignable. [3] Section 954 of the Civil Code has effected a change in the common-law rule of nonassignability of choses in action. One arising either out of violation of a right of property or out of an obligation or contract may now be transferred. (Dibble v. San Joaquin L. & P. Co., supra; Stapp v. Madera Canal etc. Co., 34 Cal. App. 41, 46 [166 Pac. 823].) [4] The cause of action here assigned is not one arising in favor of the employee by reason of his injuries, but out of the obligation imposed by the Workmen's Compensation Act on the Oil Company, which caused a property injury to the employer, to reimburse the employer, or its subrogated insurance carrier, for the amount of disability indemnity paid the employee. It must not be confused with those peculiarly personal causes of action arising out of injuries to the body or feelings of the person injured, which are not assignable.

[5] The action on the assignment was not barred by the statute of limitations. Being one based upon a liability created by statute, it was properly commenced within three years from the time the insurance company paid the disability indemnity to the injured employee.

The judgment is affirmed.

ROBERT J. HUGHES, etc., Petitioner, v. THE MUNICIPAL COURT OF THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES et al., Respondents.

[1] MUNICIPAL COURTS — SMALL CLAIMS COURTS — CONSTRUCTION OF CONSTITUTION.—The contention that by reason of the provisions of the constitution providing for the organization of municipal courts and the omission of the legislature to provide an inferior court for the city of Los Angeles with jurisdiction of claims not exceeding fifty dollars, there no longer exists in said city a forum in which such claims may be tried in accordance with the procedure prescribed by the general act creating small claims courts, cannot be maintained.

[2] Id.—ACT ESTABLISHING MUNICIPAL COURTS—SUFFICIENCY OF TITLE —CONSTITUTIONAL LAW.—The act authorizing the establishment of municipal courts (Stats. 1925, p. 648) sufficiently expresses in its title the subject (embodied in the act) referring to the continuance in existence of inferior or small claims courts.

[3] Id.—AUTHORITY TO CREATE INFERIOR COURTS.—The provision of the constitution which authorized the legislature to create courts inferior to the municipal courts, construed with reference to all other provisions of the constitutional amendment authorizing municipal courts and the statute establishing small claims courts, forces the conclusion that it was not the intention of the legislature to deprive any judicial district of the state of the benefits of the summary procedure conferred by such statute, but that it was the evident intent of the amendment to continue in force such procedure as a part of the judicial system of the state, and, if necessary for the accomplishment of the object for which small claims courts were created, to authorize the legislature to create such additional inferior courts as the business of each municipality or community may require.

[4] Id.—SMALL CLAIMS COURTS—OBJECT OF.—The small claims court was created primarily to avoid wasteful litigation and to reduce to a minimum costs of trial in cases where the demands are small.

[5] Id.—MUNICIPAL COURTS—JURISDICTION.—The legislature may relieve the municipal court of the duties with which it is charged by the Small Claims Court Act by establishing a court of inferior jurisdiction which it is authorized to create, and unless the municipal court is so relieved it is required to finish all unfinished business pending in the court which it supplants and perform the duties that the law imposes upon the justice's court.

See 7 Cal. Jur. 581, and Supplement. 216 HUGHES v. MUNICIPAL COURT. [200 Cal.

[6] Id.—Duties of Justice's Court.—The legislature by providing the small claims court procedure did not set up a separate, independent judicial tribunal to be presided over by a judge elected or appointed exclusively to perform the duties prescribed by the small claims court statute, but made it the duty of the several justices of the peace of the state to enforce its provisions.

[7] Id.—Act Establishing Municipal Courts—Construction of.—Sections 26 and 27 of the act establishing municipal courts make it clear that the duties appended to the justices' courts by the Small Claims Court Act are transferred to the municipal courts unchanged in any material respect.

[8] Id.—Section 831e et seq., Code of Civil Procedure—Construction of.—The procedure adopted by section 831e et seq. of the Code of Civil Procedure is inapplicable to small claims court matters and was not intended to abolish the small claims court procedure.

thority of the statute creating small claims courts (Stats. 1921, p. 117, adding sections 927–927p to the Code of Civil Procedure), presented to respondents Honorable Henry M. Willis and W. S. Dinsmore, presiding judge and clerk, respectively, of the Municipal Court of the City of Los Angeles, said claim and requested the same to be filed. Respondents and each of them refused to permit said claim to be filed in said court and refused to assume jurisdiction of the subject matter of the action or to at all entertain the proceeding, assigning as the grounds of their refusal that by the amendment of article VI, section 11 of the state constitution, adopted November 4, 1924, all existing inferior courts upon the organization of a municipal court as provided therein were abolished and that at the time the proceeding herein was attempted to be initiated said Municipal Court of the City of Los Angeles was fully organized and functioning as such court. It is further argued that courts of inferior jurisdiction cannot exist in cities where municipal courts are established without affirmative action on the part of the legislature creating them, and inasmuch as no inferior or small claims court has been created by any act of the legislature, none exists in the city of Los Angeles and hence respondents are justified in their refusal to entertain said action.

[1] In brief, it is the contention of respondents that by reason of the provisions of the constitution providing for the organization of municipal courts, by virtue of which the respondent court was created, and by reason of the omission of the legislature to provide by appropriate statute an inferior court in and for the city of Los Angeles, the jurisdiction of which court should not extend to cases wherein the claim or demand is more than fifty dollars, there no longer exists in said city a forum in which claims or demands of fifty dollars or less may be tried in accordance with the procedure prescribed by the general act creating small claims courts. (Code Civ. Proc., secs. 927–927p; Stats. 1921, p. 117.)

[2] It is further contended that conceding certain language employed in sections 4, 26, and 27 of the act authorizing the establishment of municipal courts (Stats. 1925, p. 648) is susceptible of a construction that would continue in existence inferior or small claims courts, the title of the 218 HUGHES v. MUNICIPAL COURT. [200 Cal.

act does not express this subject and, therefore, the provisions of said act which attempt to continue in existence said courts are void and without effect as being in contravention of article IV, section 24 of the constitution. We are of the opinion that the subject of the act is expressed by its title, which is in the following language: "An act authorizing the establishment of municipal courts, prescribing their constitution, regulation, government, procedure and jurisdiction. . . ." The language of the title is quite comprehensive and unquestionably expresses the subject, to wit, the regulation, government, procedure, and *jurisdiction* of said courts.

In the instant case the legislature has not met in biennial session since the organization of respondent court and no courts of an inferior jurisdiction have been created to perform the services formerly rendered by justices' courts. [3] The provision of the constitution which authorized the legislature to create courts inferior to the municipal courts reads: "The legislature may, however, provide for the establishment of courts inferior to municipal courts in cities and cities and counties where municipal courts are established; provided, however, that the jurisdiction of such inferior courts shall not extend to cases in which the claim or demand is more than fifty dollars." (Const., art. VI, sec. 11.) The foregoing language construed with reference to all the other provisions of the amendment and the statute establishing small claims courts forces the conclusion that it was not the intention of the law-making body to deprive any judicial district of the state of the benefits of the summary procedure conferred by statute which it had formerly enjoyed, but, on the contrary, it was the evident intent of the amendment to continue in force said summary procedure as a part of the judicial system of the state and, if necessary for the accomplishment of the object for which small claims courts were created, to authorize the legislature to create such additional inferior courts as the business of each municipality or community may require. [4] The small claims court was created primarily to avoid wasteful litigation and to reduce to a minimum costs of trial in cases where the demands are small. (*Leuschen v. Small Claims Court*, 191 Cal. 133 [215 Pac. 391].) Considering the history of the Dec. 1926.] HUGHES v. MUNICIPAL COURT. 219

entire subject, we think there is greater reason for concluding that the clause of the constitution last above cited was intended solely to confer upon the legislature the means of expediting litigation by relieving the municipal courts of congestion, rather than to deprive persons who reside within municipal court districts of a privilege equal with those who reside without the jurisdiction of said courts.

The Municipal Court Act provides that any city or city and county or township by complying with the constitutional requirements may establish a municipal court. Such a court is given enlarged jurisdiction over justices' courts and is designed to supplant those courts in case the people of said municipalities or political subdivisions elect to avail themselves of the privilege of establishing courts of enlarged jurisdiction. The justices' courts and other inferior courts of like jurisdiction cease to exist upon the establishment of a municipal court. The central thought running through the act is to abolish the justices' courts and their procedure in cities and townships which adopt the municipal court system. The amendment expressly provides that "pending actions, trials, and all pending business of inferior courts within such city or city and county or township, upon the establishment of any such municipal court shall unless otherwise provided by law be transferred to and become pending in such municipal court, and all records of such inferior courts be transferred to and thereafter be and become records of such municipal court." [5] The legislature may relieve the municipal court of the duties with which it is charged by the Small Claims Court Act by establishing a court of inferior jurisdiction which it is authorized to create, and unless the municipal court is so relieved by the legislature it is required to finish all unfinished business pending in the court which it supplants and perform the duties that the law imposed upon the justice's court. There is nothing in the language of the constitutional amendment that would justify the conclusion that the municipal court is required only to complete the unfinished business of the justice's court or other inferior court which it was established to succeed and that it may refuse to perform the service that was a part of the duty of the court which it succeeded. [6] The legislature by providing the small claims court procedure 220 HUGHES v. MUNICIPAL COURT. [200 Cal.

did not set up a separate, independent judicial tribunal to be presided over by a judge elected or appointed exclusively to perform the duties prescribed by the small claims court statute, but made it the duty of the several justices of the peace of the state to enforce its provisions. In other words, additional duties were imposed by statute upon the justices of the peace. The amendment provides that when a municipal court supplants a justice's court, the former court is clothed with the powers which said justice's court had over all matters of which the justice's or inferior court exercised jurisdiction, and it is further charged with the performance of every duty which the law imposed upon the court to whose power and jurisdiction it has become the successor, unless it is otherwise provided by law. Respondents rely largely in support of their contention upon the meaning of the clause of the amendment which provides that where a court is established in any city or in any city and county or township "there shall be no other court inferior to the superior court except as herein provided." This clause, in our view, was intended by the legislature to apply only to the establishment of distinct or independent judicial bodies constituted in the usual and ordinary manner in which courts are created.

Sections 927–927p of the Code of Civil Procedure, in defining the jurisdiction conferred by the statute adding said code sections, provides that "all justices of the peace shall exercise the jurisdiction conferred by this title and while sitting in the exercise of said jurisdiction shall be known and referred to as the small claims court." Thus it will be seen that a separate, formally constituted court was not created, but a certain procedure was merely adopted as to small demands, and the justices of the peace were required to conform to it in actions where the demand was fifty dollars or less. The justices' courts always had jurisdiction of the subject matter of the actions affected by the small claims court procedure. The practical effect of the statute was to lay additional burdens upon the justices of the peace as to matters of procedure. We think it apparent that it was not the intention of the legislature to establish a separate court of justice in the sense that courts are ordinarily constituted. Dec. 1926.] HUGHES v. MUNICIPAL COURT. 221

Section 26 of the act establishing municipal courts reflects the view of the legislature as to the meaning of the language of the amendment providing for the establishment of municipal courts. It reads: "Sec. 26. The municipal court and each judge thereof shall have and exercise all of the powers and shall do and perform all of the acts which were conferred upon, or required of, any police court, justice's court, police judge or justice of the peace, by law, whenever any such inferior court shall have been superseded by a municipal court and whenever any such police judge or justice of the peace shall become a judge of the municipal court by reason of any of the provisions of this act, and all such laws, not inconsistent herewith, are made applicable to any such municipal court and to each judge thereof." (Stats. 1925, p. 657.)

[7] This section makes it quite clear that the duties appended to justices' courts by the Small Claims Court Act are transferred to the municipal courts unchanged in any material respect. Section 27 is to the same effect.

[8] The procedure adopted by section 831e et seq. of the Code of Civil Procedure (Stats. 1925, p. 945) is inapplicable to small claims court matters and we think the procedure therein provided was not intended to abolish the small claims court procedure. To abolish the procedure would, in fact, be to abolish the court. There does not appear anywhere in the municipal court law an express or implied intention on the part of the law-making body to repeal or suspend the operation of the earlier statute establishing small claims courts, but, on the contrary, the continuation of said court seems to be contemplated. Without the procedure the court cannot exist. The application of the superior court procedure would entirely nullify the beneficent purpose of the court. From an examination of the entire subject it is reasonable to conclude that it was the intention of the legislature that the procedure which as a matter of fact creates the small claims court should continue in effect and apply uniformly throughout the state. Any other conclusion would manifestly lead to absurd results.

We are of the opinion that the amendment and statute before us are not susceptible of the construction placed upon them by respondents. Emphasis is laid upon the fact that 222 BANDY v. WESTOVER. [200 Cal.

much of the time of the municipal court judges will be consumed by small claims litigation to the neglect of municipal court affairs. While this may be so, the legislature is authorized by the constitution to relieve a congested situation by the creation of inferior courts which may engage exclusively in the dispatch of small claims matters. The small claims court is a useful and important arm of our judicial system and we are not privileged to limit its operation.

Let the writ issue as prayed for in the petition.

MINNIE D. BANDY, Appellant, v. MYRON WESTOVER et al., Respondents.

[1] CONTRACTS—EXCHANGE OF REAL PROPERTY—CONSTRUCTION OF INSTRUMENT—OFFER.—Where an owner of real property, desiring to exchange it for that of another, executes a writing by which she agrees to execute and deliver in trust a deed of her property to the other party to be held by the trustee, until such time as the other party, who is traveling in a foreign country, can be communicated with and a deed of his property made to the former, which instrument is executed by one signing as agent for the absent party, the writing does not constitute an agreement of sale and purchase between the parties, but a mere offer to exchange properties, which offer can be revoked at any time prior to acceptance, as the contract lacks consideration in that the second party gives no enforceable or any other promise to the first party.

[2] Id.—ATTEMPTED WITHDRAWAL OF OFFER—NOTICE.—In such a transaction, notice by the first party that she will not make the exchange and that the transaction be canceled, given to parties whom the court finds to be agents of said first party, is ineffective in transmitting notice to the second party, his agent, or to the escrow party.

[3] Id.—ACCEPTANCE OF OFFER.—In such a case, where the second party accepts the offer in accordance with its terms before its with-

drawal, the contract becomes binding upon the parties and authorizes the escrow-holder to deliver the respective deeds to the grantees named therein.

[4] Id.—DELIVERY OF PAPERS IN ESCROW—DELAY—WAIVER.—In such a case, the claim that because the deed and contract of the first party were not actually delivered to the escrow bank named in the contract prior to the date of a letter of withdrawal written by the first party to her agents, the letter should be held effective against the other party to the exchange, because the party holding the papers became the agent of the first party to effect the escrow delivery, cannot be sustained, where it is found that when the deed and offer were executed they were delivered to the agent of the second party, who receipted for them as held in escrow, and later said agent, on the request of the first party, while still retaining the papers, indorsed on the original offer certain matters, and other transactions occurred during said time between the first party and said agent, as under the circumstances the objection to the delay in delivering the escrow to the bank was waived.

[5] Id.—ACTION FOR CANCELLATION OF DEED—FAILURE TO MAKE RESTORATION.—In such a case, there is no justification for a judgment in favor of the first party canceling the deed executed by her, while she continues to hold title to the property of the other party.

[6] Id.—REVOCATION OF OFFER—DELAY IN ACCEPTANCE.—The claim in such a case that the offer was revoked by the unreasonable lapse of time between the making and acceptance of it is without merit, where the offer recognized that the party to whom it was made was in a foreign land and would not return for some months. Reasonable time is a relative term depending upon the terms of the offer and other circumstances.

[7] Id.—ISSUES—PLEADING—FINDINGS.—Where no issue was made in the complaint in such case as to the claim of unreasonable delay in accepting the offer, no occasion existed for a special finding thereon.

[8] Id.—COUNTERCLAIMS—CONSTRUCTION OF SECTIONS 438, 439, CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE.—The provisions of section 439 of the Code of Civil Procedure to the effect that if defendant omits to set up a counterclaim arising out of the transactions set forth in the complaint as the foundation of plaintiff's claim neither he nor his assignee can afterward maintain an action against the plaintiff therefor, make it important that section 438 of the Code of Civil Procedure be not extended to any case which does not fairly come within its provisions.

7. See 24 Cal. Jur. 950. 224 BANDY v. WESTOVER. [200 Cal.

[9] Id.—ACTION TO CANCEL DEED AND ESTABLISH TITLE—IMPROPER COUNTERCLAIM.—In a suit in equity for the cancellation of a deed to real property, and in effect to establish title thereto, counterclaims for a money judgment on account of sums expended by defendant in connection with the operation of another piece of property are improper, although they remotely arise from the same transaction, but not from the same "foundation" that plaintiff's claim rests upon, and where they would not, if established, qualify or defeat the judgment to which plaintiff would otherwise be entitled.

[10] Id.—INSUFFICIENCY OF PLEADING.—Even if the allegations of the alleged counterclaims, in such a case, be considered as a cross-complaint, the pleading could not be sustained, where it wholly fails, standing alone, to state facts sufficient to constitute an independent cause of action.

[11] Id.—FAILURE TO DEMUR OR MOVE TO STRIKE OUT.—The failure of a plaintiff to demur or move to strike out or otherwise plead to counterclaims of defendant does not preclude her from making the contention that the same are unauthorized under the system of pleading in this state.

E. Marion C. Crawford for Appellant.

Myron Westover and M. M. Meyers for Respondents.

PRESTON, J.—This is an appeal by plaintiff from a judgment in favor of defendants, and also from a judgment in favor of defendant Westover upon an original and also upon an amended and supplemental counterclaim. Neither the

11. See 23 Cal. Jur. 282. Jan. 1927.] BANDY v. WESTOVER. 225

testimony taken in the court below nor on the motion for a new trial is before us.

Plaintiff brought this action against the defendants, Myron Westover, W. H. Houghton, Frank H. Purcell, and Walter Bicknell, for cancellation of a deed executed by her to defendant Westover covering a section of land in Kimball County, Nebraska, in exchange for a twenty-acre orange grove tract, belonging to defendant Westover, situated in Los Angeles County, upon the ground that said deed was not knowingly or intentionally executed and also upon the ground that said deed and the paper writing executed at the same time constituted nothing more than an offer to exchange properties, which offer was revoked and withdrawn; also upon the ground that said deed was induced by fraudulent misrepresentations made to plaintiff by defendants Purcell and Bicknell.

Defendants Purcell and Bicknell answered, denying all the allegations of the complaint. Defendants Westover and Houghton answered separately, alleging that they had no knowledge of the transaction and adopting on information and belief the answer of their codefendants Purcell and Bicknell. Defendant Westover also filed a counterclaim in the sum of $713.23, which was later reduced to $684.13, alleged to be due him on account of escrow charges, revenue stamps on plaintiff's deed, recording deed to her, abstract of title to the Nebraska land, and also charges for labor, water, interest, and insurance accruing after June 1, 1923, in connection with the Westover tract; and said defendant Westover later filed an amended and supplemental counterclaim in the sum of $655.61, additional items of interest, labor, fuel, and supplies in connection with the operation of said orange grove tract of land.

The trial court made findings in favor of defendants and also in favor of defendant Westover on both of his counterclaims and later gave judgment for all defendants and also judgment in favor of defendant Westover on the first counterclaim and reserved future action upon the amended and supplemental counterclaim.

The court found specifically that the defendants Purcell and Bicknell were the agents of plaintiff in the transaction and not the agents of the defendant Westover; also that

200 Cal.—15 226 BANDY v. WESTOVER. [200 Cal.
the defendant Houghton was a real estate broker representing the defendant Westover only as such agent.

The court also found specifically against the plaintiff as to each and every of her claims of fraudulent misrepresentation; also as to her alleged ignorance of the execution of the deed and the intention to deliver the same, and also as to her claim that she thought the paper executed by her was to be merely evidence of good faith and that the same was to be canceled at her option.

We are thus concluded by these findings as to all these allegations of the complaint. The only question of law presented on this branch of the case by the pleadings and findings is the nature and legal effect of the transaction between the plaintiff and the defendant Westover, when viewed in the light of the acts and conduct of the parties.

[1] Plaintiff contends that the paper writing signed by her and made "Exhibit A" to the complaint in connection with the deed executed by her as a part of the same transaction amounts to nothing more than a revocable offer to exchange her Nebraska property for California property of Westover, which said offer was, prior to acceptance thereof by said defendant, withdrawn and revoked by her. The material portion of said instrument in writing is as follows:

"The said party of the first part desiring to make an exchange of the property first above described, clear of all incumbrances, for the equity in the property second above described and understanding that the owner of the said described property is in Europe on an extended tour, and difficult to communicate with, and whereas the agent W. H. Houghton, for the party of the second part, has endeavored by cablegram to reach the said party of the second part, and whereas the party of the first part waiving all responsibility and liability of the agent in and to this agreement, and desiring to take possession of the property of the party of the second part as above described and not wishing to deliver possession of the property first above described until October 1st, 1923.

"Agrees, to execute and deliver in trust, with the Trust Dep. of the Bank of Italy, in the city of Los Angeles, California, a warranty deed conveying the property of the first above described to Myron Westover, same to be held in trust by them for the benefit of the said Myron Westover until Jan. 1927.] BANDY v. WESTOVER. 227

such time as the said Myron Westover and wife can be communicated with and a deed covering the property second above described, be obtained from them to the party of the first part, and that in the meantime the party of the first part shall procure a certificate of title to the lands first above described, showing the property free and clear, and deposit same with said trust, in the Bank of Italy, said papers and deeds are to be delivered when received by the said trust department of the Bank of Italy to the respective parties hereto to complete this exchange and

"Whereas there is certain personal property connected with the property of the party of the second part, which is included in the exchange, and it is agreed that all personal property on the said property of the party of the second part is included, and

"Whereas this agreement having been read and fully understood, the party of the first part agrees to make the above exchange as above stated, by executing and delivering a warranty deed conveying the property first above described, to Myron Westover subject only to possession, which will be October 1st, 1923, and

"Whereas the said Myron Westover when communicated with will be asked to execute and deliver to the party of the first part a full covenant grant deed conveying the property second above described, subject to the right of way, restrictions, and reservations contained in former deeds, and deliver the property to the first party subject to the two above mentioned mortgages.

"This agreement shall bind the heirs, executors, and assigns of the respective parties hereto.

"In witness whereof the party of the first part has hereunto set her hand and seal this 25th day of May, 1923.

"(Signed). MINNIE D. YOUNG BOYLE.

We are in accord with the plaintiff that this writing did not constitute an agreement of sale and purchase between the parties, but, on the contrary, constituted merely an offer 228 BANDY v. WESTOVER. [200 Cal.

by the plaintiff to exchange her Nebraska property for California property of Westover, which offer she was at liberty to revoke at any time prior to acceptance thereof by the defendant Westover in the manner provided in the offer. The rule of law in this behalf is well settled. Such a contract is lacking in consideration in that Westover gave no enforceable or any other promise to plaintiff. (Civ. Code, sec. 1586; Roth v. Moeller, 185 Cal. 415, 419 [197 Pac. 62]; Hamlin v. Barnhart, 26 Cal. App. 632 [147 Pac. 1188]; 6 Cal. Jur. 51, sec. 29.)

[2] But the controlling consideration is, Did the plaintiff, prior to acceptance of the offer by the defendant Westover, withdraw or revoke the same? The findings of the court in this behalf are:

"On or about June 13, 1923, plaintiff telephoned to said defendants Purcell and Bicknell that she would not make said exchange and demanded that said transaction be cancelled, to which said demand defendants Purcell and Bicknell replied by letter dated June 13, 1923, addressed to plaintiff, saying, in regard to her telephone message that she 'did not want the deal to go thru,' that she had investigated the matter before signing said agreement and that they were not in a position to countermand any transaction. And the court finds that on or about June 14, 1923, plaintiff knew that said defendants Purcell and Bicknell considered said agreement and transaction as binding upon her."

The finding also, as noted above, was that Purcell and Bicknell were merely the agents of plaintiff and were not found to be the agents of either the defendant Westover or the defendant Houghton. It is too clear for controversy that any notice given by the plaintiff to the defendants Purcell and Bicknell alone would be of no effect in transmitting notice to the defendant Westover, the defendant Houghton, or to the escrow party in the transaction.

[3] Indeed, it appears that the defendants Purcell and Bicknell notified plaintiff that they considered the offer binding upon her and that, as far as the record shows, she acquiesced in their conclusion. At any rate the offer of plaintiff remained unrevoked until after the defendant Westover returned from Europe about September 15, 1923, and until long after September 22, 1923, upon which latter date he accepted the offer of exchange made by plaintiff by Jan. 1927.] BANDY v. WESTOVER. 229

delivering to the escrow party, pursuant to the offer, a conveyance to the Los Angeles county real and personal property. No contention is made that he did not fully comply on said date with the terms of the offer as made by plaintiff. There is no escape from the conclusion that the acceptance by Westover in the manner stated made the contract in all respects binding upon both parties and authorized the escrow party to deliver the respective deeds to the respective grantees named therein. The rule of law in this case is clear and without conflict. (Russ v. Tuttle, 158 Cal. 226 [110 Pac. 813]; Smith v. Baughman, 156 Cal. 359 [28 L. R. A. (N. S.) 522, 104 Pac. 689]; 6 Cal. Jur., p. 54, sec. 30.)

[4] We are unable to sustain plaintiff in the claim that because the deed and contract were not actually delivered to the escrow bank prior to June 13th, the said letter of withdrawal on that date to her agents should be held effective against the defendant Westover because the defendant Houghton became the agent of plaintiff to effect the escrow delivery.

The facts found show that when deed and offer were executed on May 25th they were at that time delivered to Houghton, who receipted for them as held in escrow. He later, in June, on the request of plaintiff, while still retaining the papers, indorsed on the original offer a confirmation of the personal property to be conveyed as well as a statement regarding taxes for the years 1922 and 1923. Also, on June 1st, Houghton wrote a letter to plaintiff's agents tendering possession of the orange grove. Indeed, on July 9th, plaintiff was sued by the defendants Purcell and Bicknell for commissions as brokers in the transaction, they claiming the offer was binding upon her. In September, the exact date is not stated, the documents were delivered to the Bank of Italy as the escrow party.

Under these circumstances plaintiff must be held to have waived any objections she might have had to the failure of Houghton to make immediate delivery to the escrow party. Common prudence would have required plaintiff to make known to all the interested parties her election to withdraw from the offer. Plaintiff's position is further weakened by the failure to effect or attempt to effect a rescission of the transaction by offering to restore to Westover the property he deeded to her. (Civ. Code, sec. 1691.) 230 BANDY v. WESTOVER. [200 Cal.

[5] If she were to prevail in this action the effect would be to restore her own former property to her while at the same time holding title to the property of Westover. No justification of her claim to a judgment that would have this effect can be found in the findings of the court.

[6] The claim that the offer was revoked by the unreasonable lapse of time between May 25th and September 22d is without merit as the offer recognized the fact that Westover was in Europe and would not return for some months. Reasonable time is a relative term depending upon the terms of the offer and other circumstances. (*Simons Brick Co. v. Wiglesworth*, 184 Cal. 390, 392 [19 A. L. R. 1029, 193 Pac. 947]; 6 Cal. Jur., p. 55, sec. 31.)

[7] The plaintiff made no issue in her complaint as to the claims of unreasonable delay and no occasion existed for a special finding thereon by the court.

The conclusion above announced renders unnecessary the consideration of any of the other points urged either by the plaintiff in support of her appeal or the defendants in answer thereto.

The only other matter left for consideration is the attack by plaintiff upon the counterclaims pleaded by the defendant Westover and upon which the court gave judgment as prayed for on the one and reserved judgment on the other.

It is manifest that the allowance of either of these claims of defendant Westover as proper counterclaims is erroneous. The counterclaims are controlled by sections 438 and 439 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Section 438 provides that the counterclaim "must be one existing in favor of a defendant and against a plaintiff, between whom a several judgment might be had in the action, and arising out of . . . the transaction set forth in the complaint as the foundation of the plaintiff's claim, or connected with the subject of the action."

Section 439 provides that "if the defendant omits to set up a counterclaim upon a cause arising out of the transaction set forth in the complaint as the foundation of the plaintiff's claim, neither he nor his assignee can afterwards maintain an action against the plaintiff therefor."

[8] The provisions of section 439 of the Code of Civil Procedure to the effect that if defendant omits to set up a counterclaim arising out of the transactions set forth in the Jan. 1927.] BANDY v. WESTOVER. 231

complaint as the foundation of plaintiff's claim neither he nor his assignee can afterward maintain an action against the plaintiff therefor make it important that section 438 of the Code of Civil Procedure be not extended to any case which does not fairly come within its provisions.

[9] In the case at bar plaintiff is suing upon the equity side of the court for the cancellation of a deed to real property and in effect to establish title thereto. Defendant, in his counterclaims, however, is claiming a money judgment against plaintiff on account of sums expended by him in connection with the operation of another piece of property. It is true in a remote sense that the claims arise from the same transaction, but by no means do they arise from the same "foundation" that plaintiff's claim rests upon.

Indeed, the judgment as rendered in this case by the court makes it plain also that a several judgment was not and could not be entered. The judgment has two lines of adjudication within it, one confirming the land transaction and the other a judgment for money due on a contract. Another element of the rule regarding counterclaims is that the matters set up as such counterclaims must be claims which, if established, would in some way "qualify or defeat the judgment to which plaintiff is otherwise entitled."

The counterclaims in suit likewise fail to conform to this requirement. The rule of law in this connection is well settled in this state. See *Meyer v. Quiggle*, 140 Cal. 495, 499 [74 Pac. 41], *Ward v. Goetting*, 44 Cal. App. 435, 438 [186 Pac. 640], and *Hayward v. Black*, 46 Cal. App. 504, 506 [189 Pac. 460], where the question is fully discussed.

*Bannerot v. McClure*, 39 Colo. 472 [12 L. R. A. (N. S.) 126, 90 Pac. 70], is to the same effect.

[10] Even if the allegations were to be considered as those of a cross-complaint, still the pleading could not be sustained, as it wholly fails, standing alone, to state facts sufficient to constitute an independent cause of action. (Code Civ. Proc., sec. 442; *Imperial Water Co. No. 4 v. Meserve*, 62 Cal. App. 593, 598 [217 Pac. 548].)

[11] The failure of plaintiff to demur or move to strike out or otherwise plead to the counterclaims of defendant does not preclude her from making the contention that the same are unauthorized under our system of pleading. (*MacDougall v. Maguire*, 35 Cal. 274 [95 Am. Dec. 98].) 232 MILLER v. LYONS. [200 Cal.

The above conclusion renders unnecessary the consideration by the court of the contention of plaintiff that the counterclaims as pleadings fail to state the proper averments of a cause of action.

Judgment for defendant is, therefore, affirmed and judgment in favor of defendant Westover upon his counterclaims is reversed.

THE COURT.—This is an appeal from a judgment of the superior court of the county of Los Angeles awarding to the plaintiff damages in the sum of ten thousand dollars for the death of her husband, George Miller, caused by the alleged negligence of the appellant's employees. The case was tried by the court without a jury.

In appellant's brief the sole ground of the appeal is thus stated: "We insist that there is no evidence whatsoever justifying the judgment, and that it is against the weight of all of the evidence. This is our sole basis for appeal."

The casualty occurred after dark and at about 7:30 o'clock on the evening of November 7, 1922. At the time of the accident the deceased, an oil-well worker, was driving a Dodge automobile along Norwalk road, a highway having a paved surface twenty-two feet wide, in a southerly direction and at a speed of approximately twenty-five miles an hour. Norwalk road is intersected at right angles at a certain point by a narrow road approximately fifteen feet in width. The employees of the appellant were operating a truck upon said Norwalk road in a northerly direction just prior to the accident. The truck was twenty-four feet long and carried a steel girder forty-seven and one-half feet in length, known in oil-field terms as a Kelley, diagonally across the bed thereof. It was the purpose of the driver of the truck to back it in a westerly direction into the narrow intersecting road, and to accomplish this purpose he turned the steering wheel so as to face the truck in an easterly direction down the intersecting road, intending later to back in a westerly direction. While the truck and its load were thus obstructing the entire width of the Norwalk road the deceased came upon the scene in his automobile. He was on the westerly and proper side of the Norwalk road when his car collided with that portion of the steel girder which protruded beyond the rear end of the bed of the truck. The deceased died shortly thereafter from the injuries thus incurred.

At the time of the accident, as established by the evidence and conceded by appellant, the front end of the truck was approximately three feet east of the easterly edge of the paved portion of the Norwalk road and the girder protruded about three feet beyond said front end of the truck. In this 234 MILLER v. LYONS. [200 Cal.
position the rear end of the truck extended beyond the center line of the highway and into the westerly half thereof and the girder extended well beyond the westerly line of said highway.

The evidence of one of the appellant's employees engaged on the truck at the time is to the effect that the deceased was first seen to be proceeding in the direction of the truck at a speed of twenty-five miles an hour when he was approximately twelve hundred feet away. This witness also testified that the deceased's car struck the girder about twenty seconds after he had first been seen approaching the truck. Mathematical computation reveals that the witness was not seriously in error in estimating this period of time. There is further evidence to the effect that the engine of the truck was "dead" at the time of the accident and that there was "considerable" traffic passing along the Norwalk road or highway at said time.

[1] Under the circumstances herein presented we are of the opinion that the trial court properly determined that it was an act of negligence upon the part of the appellant's employees to place their vehicle with its load entirely and completely across the Norwalk road at a time when the traffic on said highway would be endangered thereby. To place a truck carrying a steel girder forty-seven and one-half feet long across said highway after dark and at a time when traffic upon said highway would reach the position of the truck in less than one-half minute constituted a breach of duty upon the part of the appellant's servants and agents to operate the motor-truck in such a manner as not to injure third parties. The breach of said duty was clearly the proximate cause of the deceased's death.

We are not unmindful that one of the appellant's employees attempted to warn the deceased of the impending accident by leaving the truck and waving his arms. This action proved ineffective and futile in the darkness, however, as said employee was without an illuminated signal. The incident cannot serve to relieve the appellant of liability.

The mere fact that a lighted lantern had been attached to either end of the steel girder likewise would not serve to relieve the appellant of responsibility, for, as indicated in the above summary statement of the evidence, the ends of the girder protruded beyond the paved limits of the Nor- Jan. '27.] OCEAN INDUSTRIES, INC., v. SUPERIOR COURT. 235

walk road, and lanterns attached thereto would in all probability be assumed by approaching motorists to indicate the situation of obstructions adjacent to the highway. This would seem to be well illustrated by the instant case, as the evidence tends to show that the deceased, in an effort to avoid striking the appellant's truck, altered the course of his automobile, and by so doing brought it into contact with that part of said steel girder which protruded beyond the rear end of the truck.

All of these matters were for the trial court to consider and weigh. [2] When there is evidence ample to justify the findings and judgment of the court below this court will not, under the well-settled rule, disturb said findings and judgment. In our opinion the evidence herein is sufficient to warrant a finding of negligence on the part of the appellant's servants and agents, which negligence was the proximate and sole cause of the deceased's death.

Appellant's contention touching the condition of the headlights and brakes on the automobile driven by the deceased is without merit, for there is an utter lack of evidence tending to show that they were defective.

For the foregoing reasons the judgment appealed from is hereby affirmed.

1. See 10 Cal. Jur. 716; 15 R. C. L. 1092. 236 OCEAN INDUSTRIES, INC., v. SUPERIOR COURT. [200 Cal.

take judicial notice of the political history of the world in determining whether the ship, where anchored, is within or without the boundaries of the state of California.

[2] NAVIGABLE WATERS—BAY OF MONTEREY—DEFINITION.—The bay of Monterey, designated from its first discovery as a "bay," being a body of water having headlands approximately eighteen miles apart, with receding shores, giving a total width of twenty-two miles inside the headlands, with a total depth of approximately nine miles, satisfies the definition of a "bay" given by the lexicographers as a body of water around which the land forms a curve, or a recess or inlet between capes or headlands.

[3] ID.—TREATY OF GUADALUPE HIDALGO—TERRITORY ACQUIRED BY.—By the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, between the United States and Mexico, the former acquired jurisdiction over the region therein ceded, both territorial and maritime, which Mexico had theretofore asserted, and which embraced all of the ports, harbors, bays, and inlets along the coast of California and for a considerable, though perhaps indefinite, distance into the ocean, including dominion over the numerous islands lying therein adjacent to said coast.

[4] ID.—FIRST CONSTITUTION OF CALIFORNIA—DESCRIPTION OF BOUNDARIES OF STATE—INCLUSION OF BAYS.—The language of article XII of the constitution of California adopted in 1849, describing the boundaries of the state, particularly in view of the past political history of the region, was clearly intended to embrace within the boundaries and jurisdiction of the state of California the entire area of all those several bays and harbors which indent its coast.

[5] ID.—DEFINITION OF BOUNDARIES OF STATE BY LEGISLATURE—CONSTRUCTION OF ACT OF 1850.—The act of the first legislature of California, creating and defining the boundaries of the several counties of the state (Stats. 1850, p. 58) must be interpreted, if reasonably possible, so as to reconcile its terms with the language of the constitution, since it would not be presumed to be the intent of the legislature to do that which it would have no power to do, viz., to exclude from the jurisdiction of the state of California or its political subdivisions any of its land or water areas which had been embraced therein by the express terms of the constitution; and if there are any ambiguities in said act they are to be resolved in harmony with the text of the organic law.

[6] ID.—COAST LINE—BOUNDARY INTO OCEAN.—The description in the act of 1850 (Stats. 1850, p. 58), with reference to the boundaries of Santa Cruz County, "thence down the middle of said river to

3. See 1 Cal. Jur. xiv. Jan. '27.] OCEAN INDUSTRIES, INC., v. SUPERIOR COURT. 237

the Bay of Monterey and three English miles into the ocean," did not mean by the italicized phrase "into the Bay," as this construction would not only do violence to the words of the act, but would exclude the larger portion of Monterey Bay from the boundaries and jurisdiction of the state of California despite the very plain inclusion therein of the entire bay according to the constitution; and the phrase "parallel to the coast" in said description is applied to the general coast line, regardless of the bays and inlets along the respective coast lines and may reasonably be interpreted to be consistent with the constitution which includes within the state boundaries all islands, harbors, and bays along and adjacent to the coast.

[7] Id.—JURISDICTION OVER MONTEREY BAY—ADOPTION OF POLITICAL CODE—BOUNDARIES.—The legislature in the adoption of the Political Code in 1872 left the boundary of the county of Santa Cruz substantially unchanged on its oceanward side but changed the boundary description of the county of Monterey to read, "beginning in the Pacific Ocean at the southwest corner of Santa Cruz," etc., and the entire bay of Monterey within its headlands and thence into the ocean for a distance of three nautical miles was thus definitely placed within the sovereignty of the state of California and within the boundaries and jurisdiction respectively of the counties of Santa Cruz and Monterey.

[8] Id.—JURISDICTION OVER BAYS—EXTENT OF—INTERNATIONAL LAW.—The contention that by the rules of international law territorial jurisdiction of a maritime state does not extend beyond three miles from the shore line and follows the indentations of the coast into all bays or gulfs, the headlands of which are more than six miles apart, cannot be maintained, as, while it is true that by treaties and conventions between the powers chiefly in arbitration cases the fixation of a six-mile distance between headlands of certain bays and inlets has at times been agreed upon in the settlement of international disputes, it cannot be said that there is any rule of international law upon the subject, the whole matter resting in the undisputed assertion of jurisdiction by the power possessing the inclosing shore line of the bay or inlet in question.

[9] Id.—BAY OF MONTEREY—BOUNDARIES OF STATE.—The bay of Monterey between its headlands and the ocean adjacent to a line drawn between these headlands for a distance of three nautical miles is within the boundaries of the state of California and of the counties respectively of Santa Cruz and Monterey.

Loucks & Phister and Cushing & Cushing for Petitioner.

B. D. Marx Greene for Respondents.

RICHARDS, J.—The petitioner herein applied for the issuance of a writ of prohibition whereby it sought to have the respondent Superior Court of the State of California in and for the County of Santa Cruz, and the Judge thereof, commanded to desist and refrain from any and all further proceedings in a certain action pending in said court entitled "People of the State of California, Plaintiff vs. Ocean Industries Inc. a corporation et al., Defendants," and particularly from making or entering any preliminary or other injunction affecting said defendant in said action. In support of its said application the petitioner alleged that it was a corporation duly organized as such under the laws of the state of Nevada for the purpose of carrying on the business of catching and cleaning fish and extracting the oil therefrom, in the waters of the Pacific Ocean at divers places along the coast line of North America between the parallels of 25 degrees and 40 degrees north latitude; and that in order to carry on its said business the petitioner had during the month of September, 1926, purchased and registered a certain vessel named "Peralta" and had fitted out and equipped said vessel with the necessary machinery and equipment for the production of fish-meal and the extraction of oil from fish, and had thereafter and during the month of October, 1926, moved the said vessel to and anchored the Jan. '27.] OCEAN INDUSTRIES, INC., v. SUPERIOR COURT. 239

same at a point designated as 121 degrees 55 minutes 12 seconds west longitude and 36 degrees 53 minutes 12 seconds north latitude, which said point of anchorage was and is more than three and one-half miles distant from the nearest low-water mark on the shores of the Pacific Ocean and of the mainland or of any island or islands adjacent thereto; and that said petitioner is engaged in and proposes to carry on its aforesaid business and operations thereat, using in the course thereof fish caught in the waters of the Pacific Ocean more than three and one-half miles distant from the said coast line. The petitioner further alleges that on the eighteenth day of October, 1926, the people of the state of California, through its attorney-general and certain other of its officials, caused to be filed in the Superior Court in and for the said county of Santa Cruz a complaint for an injunction, a copy of which is attached to its said application, wherein the said plaintiff sought to have the petitioner herein enjoined from conducting or continuing its said operations upon said vessel at its said place of anchorage; that thereupon and on said last-named date the said court and the judge thereof made and entered its order directing said defendant in said action, its officers and employees, to show cause at a designated time before said court why a preliminary injunction should not issue in said action as prayed for therein, and also in the meantime caused to be issued a temporary restraining order of like tenor and effect, both of which said orders are also attached as exhibits to petitioner's said application; that copies of said orders together with a copy of the complaint and summons in said action were served upon the defendant therein as provided by law; that said defendant, the petitioner herein, appeared in said court in response to said orders and process and thereupon presented and filed a certain affidavit in denial of certain of the averments of said complaint, a copy of which affidavit is also attached as an exhibit to the petitioner's application herein and from which it appears that the substantial allegations of the petition are set forth in said affidavit; that a hearing was thereafter and on the twenty-sixth day of October, 1926, had before said court upon the matters referred to in said complaint and orders and the defendants' return thereto, at the conclusion of which hearing the said Superior Court made and entered its order determining that 240 OCEAN INDUSTRIES, INC., v. SUPERIOR COURT. [200 Cal.

the plaintiff in said action was entitled to a preliminary injunction restraining the defendant therein from further carrying on any operation or operations for the reduction of fish or from using any fish of the variety known as "sardines" in the reduction plant upon said ship while situate at its said place of anchorage; and said court announced as a result of its said determination that it would make and enter a preliminary injunction accordingly and that said court threatens and will, unless prohibited therefrom by this court herein, make and enter and enforce such injunction. The petitioner further alleges that the issuance and enforcement of said preliminary injunction as proposed and threatened by said court is in excess of and beyond the jurisdiction of said court for the reason that the said place of anchorage of said vessel and the place where the said plant of the petitioner herein is being and is proposed to be operated is outside of the state of California and is outside of and beyond the jurisdiction of said court. Finally, the petitioner alleges that the effect of the operation and enforcement of said preliminary injunction would work irreparable injury to the petitioner herein in ways which are set forth with much of detail in its said application; wherefore it prays the issuance of the peremptory writ sought herein.

To the foregoing petition the respondents have made their reply by way of both demurrer and answer, by the first of which pleadings they put in issue the main considerations presented to this court for its determination herein, and to these we will first direct our attention. The preliminary questions thus presented for our solution are, first, as to whether the ship "Peralta" upon which the petitioner herein is engaged in conducting its aforesaid operations and upon which it intends to continue the same unless prevented from so doing by the preliminary injunction proposed to be issued by the respondents herein, is at its admitted place of anchorage, within or without the boundaries of the state of California; second, whether the aforesaid operations of said petitioner upon said vessel and at said point, if within the boundaries of the state of California, are in violation of its laws. The precise point in issue under the first of these propositions has been made very definite by the presentation on behalf of both of the parties hereto in their plead- Jan. '27.] OCEAN INDUSTRIES, INC., v. SUPERIOR COURT. 241

ings and upon the hearing hereon of certain maps and plats delineating the boundaries and dimensions of the bay of Monterey, as well as the exact location of the ship "Peralta" within the headlands of said body of water, but more than three nautical miles from low-water mark along the shore line thereof. If it shall be found as a matter of law that the entire area of the bay of Monterey, so called, extends oceanward to a line drawn between the headlands thereof; and if it shall further be found that said entire area of said bay of Monterey is to be held included within the territorial boundaries of the state of California, it would follow irresistably that the ship "Peralta" at its designated place of anchorage is within said state and is subject to its laws.

[1] Upon the solution of the problem thus presented this court is entitled to bring to bear, in so far as it may be aided thereby, its judicial notice of the political history of the world (Code Civ. Proc., sec. 1875, subd. 8), when in the early years of the sixteenth century of our era Spain through her voyagers had discovered and through her conquistadores established her dominion over that region in the southwestern portion of North America which became known as "New Spain" she began through her viceroys to send forth navigators to the northward along the western coast of the continent, with the twofold object of adding further territory to her domain and of discovering the fabled northwest passage. The first of these navigators to thus extend his voyages beyond what is now known as Lower California was Juan Cabrillo. This bold navigator after a stormy voyage up an unknown coast sighted the wooded headland to which he gave the name of Point Pinos and sailed into the body of water behind it, to which, as recorded in his log, he also gave the name "Bahía de Los Pinos," the Bay of Pines. He was followed in 1602 by another navigator, Sebastian Vizcaino, who also found and entered the same incurved body of water upon the inner shores of which he landed, taking formal possession of its coasts in the name of his sovereign and rechristening it "Bahía de Monterey," in honor of his patron the Count de Monterey, then viceroy of New Spain, which name it has ever since borne in the official records of Spain, of Mexico, the United States, and state of California.

[2] The bay of Monterey, thus designated from its first discovery as a "bay," is a body of water having

200 Cal.—16 242 OCEAN INDUSTRIES, INC., v. SUPERIOR COURT. [200 Cal.

headlands approximately eighteen miles apart, with receding shores, giving a total width of twenty-two miles inside the headlands, with a total depth of approximately nine miles. It thus satisfies the definition of a "bay" given by the lexicographers as a body of water around which the land forms a curve; or a recess or inlet between capes or headlands. (Webster, Title "Bay.") It is needless to detail the history of the increasingly troubled effort of Spain and later of Mexico to assert and maintain the sovereignty of each in turn over the indefinite region known as California and its adjacent islands, inlets, and seas; but the interesting fact may be noted as having its bearing upon whatever question of international law is involved herein that the dispute between Spain and England in the year 1790 growing out of the northwest coast fur trade was for the time being settled by the so-called Nootka Convention, wherein as between these two powers, which were then the greatest maritime powers of the known world, it was agreed that the exclusive sovereignty of Spain should be recognized and respected over all parts of the northwest coast already occupied by subjects of Spain and for a distance of ten leagues into the ocean. The agreements of this convention were ratified by the contracting powers and the claims of Spain to exclusive sovereignty and jurisdiction over the coasts of what is now California and Oregon as far north as the mouth of the Columbia River on land and to a distance of ten leagues into the ocean were conceded and confirmed. This jurisdiction over these coasts and seas and adjacent islands Spain and her successor Mexico thereafter asserted and insisted upon through rigid maritime regulations over the increasing coastal traffic during the half century or so following the date of said treaty and down to the time of the occurrence of the war between the United States and Mexico and consequent seizure of California by the former, manifested by the raising of the American flag at Monterey on July 7, 1846, and by the subsequent events which marked the passing of the old dominion. [3] By the terms of the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, which was finally ratified at the city of Queretaro on May 30, 1848, Mexico ceded to the United States all territory lying to the northward of a line drawn from the mouth of the Rio Grande westerly to the Pacific Ocean. By virtue of this treaty the United States assumed Jan. '27.] OCEAN INDUSTRIES, INC., v. SUPERIOR COURT. 243

that jurisdiction over the region thus ceded, both territorial and maritime, which Mexico had theretofore asserted, and which embraced all of the ports, harbors, bays, and inlets along the coast of California and for a considerable though perhaps indefinite distance into the ocean, including dominion over the numerous islands lying therein adjacent to said coast. [4] When in the course of events the duly constituted framers of the constitution of California assembled at Monterey in the autumn of 1849 and proceeded to frame the first constitution of California they inserted in article XII thereof a description of the boundaries of the state, which, in so far as the southerly and westerly lines thereof were concerned, read as follows: "Thence running west and along said boundary line [the Mexican boundary] to the Pacific Ocean, and extending therein three English miles; thence running in a northwesterly direction and following the direction of the Pacific coast to the forty-second degree of north latitude; thence on the line of said forty-second degree of north latitude to the place of beginning. Also all the islands, harbors and bays along and adjacent to the coast."

This language in our first constitution, particularly in view of the past political history of the region, would seem to be too clear to admit of any doubt as to its meaning or that it was intended to embrace within the boundaries and jurisdiction of the state of California the entire area of all those several bays and harbors which indent its coast. [5] The petitioner, however, argues that the first legislature of California placed a more limited interpretation upon the language of the constitution in its act (Stats. 1850, p. 58), creating and defining the boundaries of the several counties of the newly formed state. We are referred to the description of the boundaries of the county of Santa Cruz (then named Branciforte) in said act which reads as follows: "Beginning in the ocean three English miles from land at a point due west of the head of San Francisquito Creek, and running due east to the summit of the Santa Cruz Mountains; thence in a southeasterly direction along the summit of said mountains to the Pajaro River; thence down the middle of said river to the Bay of Monterey, and three English miles into the ocean; thence in a northwesterly direction parallel with the coast to the point of beginning." In interpreting this act, intended to set off the land and water 244 OCEAN INDUSTRIES, INC., v. SUPERIOR COURT. [200 Cal.

area of California into appropriate political subdivisions, we are to do so in such a way as to reconcile its terms, if reasonably possible, with the language of the constitution, since it would not be presumed to be the intent of the legislature to do that which it would have no power to do, viz., to exclude from the jurisdiction of the state of California or its political subdivisions any of its land or water areas which had been embraced therein by the express terms of its constitution. This being so, if there are any ambiguities in the act in question they are to be resolved in harmony with the text of the organic law. [6] Thus it is that when we find in the above quoted description the following course and distance, "Thence down the middle of said river to the Bay of Monterey and three English miles into the ocean," we are to assume that the framers of the act did not mean by the above emphasized phrase "into the Bay," since so to construe it would be not only to do violence to its words but to exclude the larger portion of Monterey Bay from the boundaries and jurisdiction of the state of California despite the very plain inclusion therein of the entire bay according to the constitution. The petitioner, however, lays especial emphasis upon the description reading, "Thence in a north-westerly direction parallel to the coast to the point of beginning." When, however, we read the act in its entirety we find that the phrase "parallel to the coast" is repeatedly applied with reference to the general coast lines of every coast county described therein, regardless of the bays and inlets along said respective coast lines. Reasonably interpreted this phrase may bear a meaning entirely consistent with the phrasing of the constitution which includes within the state boundaries "all islands, harbors and bays along and adjacent to the coast." When we come to consider the description of the county of Monterey as contained in the said act of 1850 the ambiguities of the act become still more apparent. Said description begins, "At the mouth of the Pajaro River on the Bay of Monterey," and ends, "Thence parallel with the coast to the place of beginning." It is thus plain that the northern boundary of Monterey County as thus given does not close with the southern boundary of Braneiforte or Santa Cruz County even according to the petitioner's interpretation of the act. [7] The state legislature apparently had discovered this hiatus when it came to Jan. '27.] OCEAN INDUSTRIES, INC., v. SUPERIOR COURT. 245

adopt the provisions of the Political Code in 1872, since while it left the boundary of the county of Santa Cruz substantially unchanged on its oceanward side (Pol. Code, sec. 3952), it changed the boundary description of the county of Monterey so as to make it read: "Beginning in the Pacific Ocean at the southwest corner of Santa Cruz," etc., to the place of beginning. (Pol. Code, sec. 3935.) The entire bay of Monterey within its headlands and thence into the ocean for a distance of three nautical miles was thus, we think, definitely placed within the sovereignty of the state of California and within the boundaries and jurisdiction respectively of the counties of Santa Cruz and Monterey.

[8] The petitioner, however, insists that by the rules of international law the territorial jurisdiction of a maritime state does not extend beyond three miles from the shore line and follows the indentations of the coast into all bays or gulfs, the headlands of which are more than six miles apart, and cites certain text-writers upon international law in support of that contention. These text-writers give as the reason for this rule the somewhat fantastic one that while our modern international law was in the process of forming, the range of coast planted cannon did not exceed three miles. These text-writers, however, while suggesting such a rule based upon such a long-lost reason admit that as to the stronger maritime powers of modern Europe the rule was more honored in the breach than in the observance. Britain, which has depended more upon its "Wooden Walls" than upon its coast ordnance, has always asserted its sovereignty not only over the entire area of the bays, ports, harbors, friths, and other inlets along its much indented coast line, but also over the bays, gulfs, and inlets of its dependencies; such, for example, as the bay of Conception in Newfoundland, which has a breadth of fifteen miles. These text-writers also point out that France has always asserted sovereignty over the bay of Cancale, which is seventeen miles wide at its headlands, and that the United States asserts and has maintained its jurisdiction over the bays of Delaware and Chesapeake, although the former has a headland width of fifteen and the latter of twelve miles. In Moore's Digest of International Law the basis of our assertion of jurisdiction over the entire area of Chesapeake Bay is set forth in its reference to the 246 OCEAN INDUSTRIES, INC., v. SUPERIOR COURT. [200 Cal.

decision of the Commissioners of Alabama Claims, wherein the extent of that jurisdiction was directly involved. The decision of the commission is illuminating in its bearing upon the instant proceeding. It reads: "Considering, therefore, the importance of the question, the configuration of Chesapeake Bay, the fact that its headlands are well marked, and but twelve miles apart, that it and its tributaries are wholly within our own territory, that the boundary lines of adjacent States encompass it; that from the earliest history of the country it has been claimed to be territorial waters, and that the claim has never been questioned; that it cannot become the pathway from one nation to another; and remembering the doctrines of the recognized authorities upon international law, as well as the holdings of the English Courts as to the Bristol Channel and Conception Bay, and bearing in mind the matter of the brig 'Grange' and the position taken by the Government as to Delaware Bay, we are forced to the conclusion that Chesapeake Bay must be held to be wholly within the territorial jurisdiction and authority of the Government of the United States." While it is true that by treaties and conventions between the powers chiefly in arbitration cases the fixation of a six-mile distance between headlands of certain bays and inlets have at times been agreed upon in the settlement of international disputes, it cannot be said that there is any rule of international law upon the subject, the whole matter resting in the undisputed assertion of jurisdiction by the power of possessing the inclosing shore line of the bay or inlet in question. [9] This being so, we arrive at the conclusion that the bay of Monterey between its headlands and the ocean adjacent to a line drawn between these headlands for a distance of three nautical miles is within the boundaries of the state of California and of the counties respectively of Santa Cruz and Monterey. The particular location of the ship "Peralta" as given in the petitioner's application herein places it within the county of Santa Cruz and hence within the jurisdiction of the Superior Court in and for said County of Santa Cruz. It is not seriously contended by the petitioner that the acts which it proposes to do upon and by the use of said vessel and its equipment at said point would not, if permitted, constitute a violation of the laws of the state of California regulating the taking and reduction of that species of marine Jan. 1927.] ESTATE OF KIMBALL. 247

fish known as "sardines." [10] It follows that the Superior Court in and for the County of Santa Cruz has jurisdiction over offenses against these laws; and hence that the alternative writ issued herein should be discharged and the application of the petitioner for a permanent writ of prohibition denied.

Harry I. Stafford and W. F. Stafford for Appellant.

Edward M. Leonard for Respondents.

RICHARDS, J.—These appeals are from two orders, one from an order denying the application of the appellant to be appointed executor of the last will and testament of Frederick H. Kimball, deceased, and the other an appeal from an order appointing the respondents Charles F. Tully as administrator and Sarah J. Ring as administratrix, with the will annexed, of the estate of said decedent. The facts are not disputed. Frederick H. Kimball died testate in the city and county of San Francisco, leaving his last will and testament, the only portions of which presented for consideration upon these appeals are those relating to the appointment of those who were to act as executrix or executor of said will. These portions of said will read as follows: "To my dearly loved wife and little sweetheart, Charlotte Frances Kimball, I devise and bequeath all of my property real, personal and mixed of whatsoever nature not otherwise provided for in this my last will, and direct said wife Charlotte Frances Kimball to be the sole executrix of this my last will without Bonds or obligations to any one. . . . Should it please the Good Lord to call myself and little Wife at the same time, regardless of who died first, it is my wish that my property shall be equally divided between Sarah Ring, Charles H. Kimball, Harold E. Ring, S. J., Mildred Kielty, Camille Vissas, and they to carry out bequest on reverse side of this sheet, and also Bequests made in the last will of my Dearly Beloved Wife—and Sarah Ring, Charles H. Kimball and Harold E. Ring, S. J., shall be Executors without Bond." The death of Frederick H. Kimball occurred on September 21, 1925. Three days later, or on September 24, 1925, his wife, Charlotte Frances Kimball died; but subsequent to her husband's death, viz., on September 22, 1925, she signed and acknowledged a document addressed to the superior court in and for the city and county of San Fran- Jan. 1927.] ESTATE OF KIMBALL. 249

cisco, whereby she expressly renounced her right to act as executrix of the last will and testament of her deceased husband and appointed Charles F. Tully and Sarah J. Ring, her brother and sister, to act as administrator and administratrix, with the will annexed, of the estate of said decedent. She died two days later. Thereafter said Charles F. Tully and Sarah J. Ring filed said will for probate, together with their application to said court for the issuance of letters of administration thereon, which application, after due notice of the hearing, came on to be heard before said court on October 9, 1925, and was then heard without opposition; and at the conclusion of said hearing said will was duly admitted to probate and an order was made and entered appointing said Charles F. Tully and Sarah J. Ring administrator and administratrix, respectively, with the will annexed, of said estate; and they each thereupon duly qualified and entered upon their duties as such. On December 9, 1925, Charles H. Kimball, the appellant herein, filed his petition in said court praying for the removal of said Charles F. Tully and Sarah J. Ring as such administrator and administratrix, respectively, of said estate and the cancellation of their and each of their letters of administration and that he be appointed the executor of said will. An answer was filed to said petition and the matter came on for hearing before said court on December 17, 1925, and was then heard and submitted to said court, which, on February 5, 1926, made and entered its order denying the appellant's petition both for the removal of said respondents and for the issuance to appellant of letters testamentary as executor of the will of said decedent. From each of the aforesaid orders the appeals herein have been taken. These appeals present the contentions of the appellant herein in two aspects. The first relates to the right of said appellant to receive the appointment of executor of said will in accordance with the terms thereof. This asserted right on his part must be predicated upon the fact, if it be a fact, that Frederick H. Kimball and his wife Charlotte Frances Kimball died "at the same time" according to the intent and meaning of the testator as expressed in his said will. But obviously this is not the fact in so far as is disclosed by the record herein. Conceivably it might have been shown that the testator had in contem- 250 ESTATE OF KIMBALL. [200 Cal.
plation when he prepared his holographic will that his wife and he might come to their end in a common casualty and that its peculiar wording had reference to such an eventuality, in which case it would have been immaterial which died first, or even that the one survived the other for a brief period, though dying from the fatal injuries received in the common disaster. Had such a state of things been shown the appellant might have thus created a basis for his claim of right to appointment as the executor of said will. [1] But no such facts have been made to appear, and for all that this record discloses the death of the wife was in nowise connected by any causation with the death of the husband; and this being so, three days of separation between the two events would be as effectual to defeat the operation of the terms of said will as to the conditional appointment of the appellant to be the executor thereof as any longer period of intermission would have been. It follows that the appellant never attained the right to such appointment, and hence that in so far as his appeal lies from the order of the trial court denying his petition for such appointment is concerned, that portion of its order to that effect must be affirmed.

[2] The second aspect of the appellant's contentions upon these appeals is also twofold, the first relating to the correctness of the order of the trial court appointing the respondents herein administrator and administratrix, respectively, with the will annexed, of the estate of Frederick H. Kimball, deceased, and the second relating to the correctness of its subsequent order refusing to revoke said appointments upon the appellant's petition therefor. As to the first of these the appellant insists that the document executed by Charlotte Frances Kimball two days before she died was ineffectual to form the basis for the appointment of the respondents as administrator and administratrix, respectively, with the will annexed, of the estate of Frederick H. Kimball, deceased, for the reason that since Charlotte Frances Kimball had herself died before the application for such appointment by these respondents, her right of appointment died with her and hence could not suffice to form the foundation of the right of these respondents to be appointed in conformity with its nomination. The appellant presents Jan. 1927.] ESTATE OF KIMBALL. 251

an interesting legal problem in relation to his foregoing contention, but it is one which we do not feel called upon to decide. Charlotte Francis Kimball, the executrix first named in said will, having died shortly after the decease of her husband, the testator, her right to letters testamentary thereby ceased. But having survived her husband for a period of time sufficient to amount to an advoidance of the conditions of his will, which depended upon their dying "at the same time," there remained no executrix or executor qualified for appointment as such under said will. It would therefore become the duty of the court wherein said document was offered for probate to appoint some qualified person or persons to receive letters of administration, with the will annexed. The respondents made due application for the probate of said will and for the issuance of letters of administration with the will annexed thereon, and while in their said application they set forth the fact of their nomination by Charlotte Frances Kimball to receive such letters, it is to be noted that they did not pray for such appointment of themselves, but only "that the court may make all necessary and proper orders to be made in the premises." It is also to be noted that the order of the trial court making such appointments was a general order, which did not purport upon its face to be predicated upon the aforesaid nomination of Charlotte Frances Kimball, then deceased. Such being its tenor it was clearly within the powers of the court as prescribed in the sections of the Code of Civil Procedure relating to the selection of administrators with the will annexed of testate decedents' estates (section 1426). The respondents were qualified to receive such appointment. The order was a valid order at the time it was made, entirely regardless of the validity or invalidity of the nomination by Charlotte Frances Kimball, then deceased, of the individuals thus selected as suitable for such appointment. This being so, and the appellant herein, upon his later petition for the removal of the respondents and the cancellation of their letters of administration, having made no showing of any disqualification or of any adequate grounds for their removal, the order of the court denying his petition therefor was properly made. The several orders of said court ap- 252 ESTATE OF BABB. [200 Cal.
pealed from should therefore be, and they are hereby, affirmed.

[1] ESTATES OF DECEASED PERSONS—CONTOVERSY BETWEEN LEGATEES—PARTY AGGRIEVED—APPEAL BY EXECUTOR—DISMISSAL.—Where a controversy in the estate of a deceased person is entirely between the different legatees under the last will of the deceased, the executor having no interest therein is not a party aggrieved by a decree of distribution determining the rights of the several legatees and an appeal by the executor from the decree will, therefore, be dismissed.

[2] Id.—BEQUESTS OF MONEY IN BANK—BEQUEST OF INTEREST IN ESTATE—CONSTRUCTION OF WILL.—Where a testator bequeaths all money that he may have in any bank at the time of his death to a certain person, and by a later paragraph of his will bequeaths and devises all of his right, title, and interest in the estate of a decedent to which he was one of the heirs at law, the legatee of the money in bank is entitled to all moneys in bank at the time of the death of testator, from whatever source coming, including moneys received by the latter before his death from the estate of which he was an heir.

[3] Id.—CONSTRUCTION OF WILL—TIME.—A will speaks from the date of the death of the testator and not from the date of its execution.

[4] Id.—RECEIPT OF MONEY—ADEMPTION OF LEGACIES.—The receipt by the testator of the money and property from the estate of which he was an heir, in such case, produced an ademption of the legacies to the parties to whom he had bequeathed and devised his interest in said estate, in so far as the money and property so received by the testator might have been included in said legacies had said

money and property remained a part of the said estate up to and including the date of the testator's death.

[5] Id.—Proceeds from Sale of Stock—Residuary Legacy.—In such a case, where the testator received during his lifetime stock from the estate of which he was an heir, which stock was a part of his estate at the time of his death, the residuum of the proceeds of sale of the stock passed to the residuary legatee instead of to the specific legatees of the interest of the decedent in the estate from which said stock came.

[6] Id.—Payment of Expenses—Residuary Legacy.—In such a case, it was error for the court to make a proportionate deduction of the debts, funeral expenses, and the expenses of administration from the specific legacies, and said debts and expenses should have been deducted from the residuum of the estate before any distribution to the residuary legatee.

George W. Waldorf and Edwin A. Wilcox for Appellants.

Owen D. Richardson for Respondents.

CURTIS, J.—On March 7, 1922, Walter W. Babb, a single man, executed his will, by the terms of which he gave to his uncle, Edward N. Williams, "all the money I may have in any bank at the time of my decease, and all the money I may then have loaned out." This provision was contained in paragraph II of his will. By paragraph III of said will, after reciting that he was one of the heirs at law of Mary L. Taylor, deceased, and as such was entitled to an interest in her estate, he disposed of said interest as follows: "I give, devise and bequeath all my right, title and interest in said Mary L. Taylor estate, and the real and personal property thereto belonging as follows, to-wit." Then follows the five 254 ESTATE OF BABB. [200 Cal.
names of respondents herein, each of whom was given an undivided one-fifth of the testator's interest in the estate of Mary L. Taylor, deceased, and the property thereof. By paragraph VI of said will, the respondents, Harriet B. Sargent and Lucy S. Boyd, were named as his residuary legatees. The testator died on October 26, 1925, at which time there was on deposit in the Bank of San Jose, at San Jose, California, to his credit, the sum of $7,652.54. At the time he executed his will the estate of Mary L. Taylor, deceased, was in course of administration and was still unsettled at the time of the death of said testator. During his lifetime and subsequent to the execution of said will said testator received from the estate of said Mary L. Taylor, deceased, the sum of $4,048.20 in money in 70 shares of the capital stock of the Cincinnati Discount Company. The money received from the Taylor estate was deposited to the credit of testator by him in said Bank of San Jose and was undoubtedly a part of the money the said deceased left on deposit in said bank at the time of his death. The executor of the will of said deceased received from the 70 shares of the capital stock of the Cincinnati Discount Company the sum of $4,620, $420 as dividends on said stock, and $4,200 from a subsequent sale thereof. Said executor also received the sum of $97 direct from the estate of Mary L. Taylor, deceased, which last-named sum was the only money or property received by said executor from said estate. On the final distribution the probate court distributed to respondents the sum of $8,765.20, which sum was made up of said sum of $4,048.20, received by said testator during his lifetime from the estate of Mary L. Taylor, deceased, the further sum of $4,620 being the proceeds received from the said 70 shares of the capital stock of the Cincinnati Discount Company, and also said sum of $97 received by said executor direct from said estate of Mary L. Taylor, deceased. Other property belonging to the estate of Walter W. Babb, deceased, was distributed according to the terms of his last will and testament and there is no controversy over the correctness of the decree of distribution in respect to this last mentioned property. From that part of the decree of distribution, however, distributing to the respondents the said sum of $8,765.20, the said Edward N. Williams has appealed, Jan. 1927.]                                                                 Esate of Babb.                                                                 255

both as the executor of said will and also individually as one of the legatees under said will.

[1] This controversy is entirely between the different legatees under the last will of said deceased, in which controversy the executor of said will, as such, has no interest. He is not a party aggrieved by a decree of distribution determining the rights of several devisees to the estate of the testator (2 Cal. Jur. 220; Estate of Ross, 179 Cal. 358, 360 [182 Pac. 303]; Estate of Marrey, 65 Cal. 287 [3 Pac. 896]). The appeal of the executor should therefore be dismissed.

[2] The appeal of Edward N. Williams as a legatee under the will of said deceased, claiming that the property of said estate, or, at least a portion thereof, distributed to the respondents herein, should have been distributed to him under the terms of said will is properly before us. It is the contention of appellant that said sum of $4,048.20 (received by the testator during his lifetime from the estate of Mary L. Taylor, deceased, and which was on deposit with the Bank of San Jose, with other moneys of said testator at the time of the latter's death) should have been under paragraph II of said will distributed to him. On the other hand, the respondents, seeking an affirmance of the decree of distribution distributing this money to them, assert that as this money was received by said testator from the estate of Mary L. Taylor, deceased, it was by the terms of paragraph III of said will bequeathed and devised to them and was therefore rightfully distributed to them.

[3] A will speaks from the date of the death of the deceased and not from the date of its execution (Estate of Rounds, 180 Cal. 386 [181 Pac. 638]; Estate of Page, 181 Cal. 537 [185 Pac. 383]; 1 Redfield on Wills, 3d ed., sec. 30; 3 Woerner's American Law of Administration, 3d ed., sec. 419; 40 Cyc. 1424). The rule is stated in the above citation from Cyc. in the following language: "Although for some purposes a will is considered as speaking from the date of its execution, as a general rule it speaks from the death of the testator and must be construed as operating according to the state of things then existing, . . ." In 1 Redfield on Wills, third edition, section 30, we find the rule expressed as follows: "The very nature of the testamentary act, which is expected to take effect only at the time of the 256 ESTATE OF BABB. [200 Cal.
decease of the testator, presupposes, that so far as facts and circumstances are susceptible of anticipation by him, so as to enable him to place himself in the position he will then be, relatively to his property and his obligations to his family, that he will have used the language of his will, with reference more particularly to that period."

Examining the will of the testator, Walter W. Babb, deceased, in the light of the rule enunciated by these authorities, we are forced to the conclusion that when the testator in paragraph II of his will used the expression, "Unto my Uncle, Edward N. Williams, . . . I give and bequeath all the money I may have in any bank at the time of my decease," he intended to refer, and did refer, in as clear and apt language as it was possible for him to employ to all the money which belonged to him and which was on deposit in any bank at the time of his death, irrespective of the sources from which he had received said money. Any other construction would do violence to the plain and direct intent of the testator as expressed in this paragraph of his will. Therefore, the provision of paragraph II of his will, devising and bequeathing to appellant the money on deposit in any bank at the time of his death, must control unless there is some other direction contained in the will limiting this provision or evincing a clear intent to make a different disposition of said money or of some part thereof. Respondents contend that such a provision is to be found in paragraph III of the will whereby the testator devises and bequeaths to them all of his right, title, and interest in the estate of Mary L. Taylor, deceased, and the property belonging thereto. As we have already seen, at the time of the execution of the will the Taylor estate was in process of administration and during the lifetime of the testator he received from said estate and deposited to his credit in said bank the sum of $4,048.20. He also received the 70 shares of capital stock in the Cincinnati Discount Company. So that at the death of said testator this money and these shares of stock previously received by him from said estate were no part of the Taylor estate, but constituted a part of the estate of the testator in kind and character as they existed at the time of his death. This property had been severed from the Taylor estate and completely extinguished Jan. 1927.]                                                                 Esate of Babb.                                                                 257

as a part of said estate upon its receipt by the testator. Thereafter it had no relation to said estate except as money and property derived therefrom. Therefore when paragraph III of the will is read, having in mind the rule that a will speaks from the date of the death of the testator, in connection with the interest of the testator in the Taylor estate, it can only refer to the interest therein at the death of the testator and cannot be extended or enlarged so as to include or embrace any part of the property previously received by said testator from said estate. [4] The receipt by the testator of the money and property from the Taylor estate produced an ademption of the legacies to the respondents in so far as the money and property so received by the testator might have been included in said legacies had said money and property remained a part of the Taylor estate up to and including the date of the testator's death (Estate of Goodfellow, 166 Cal. 409 [137 Pac. 12]). The legacies bequeathed to respondents by said will were specific legacies (Civ. Code, sec. 1357). "Ademption is effected by the extinction of the thing or fund bequeathed, . . . (Kramer v. Kramer, 201 Fed. 248). Had the Taylor estate been finally distributed during the lifetime of the testator "the thing or fund" bequeathed to the respondents would have been completely extinguished at the date of the testator's death and the respondents would have taken nothing under paragraph III of testator's will. In so far as any part or portion of the Taylor estate had been distributed to the testator during his lifetime, to that extent had the fund or property bequeathed to respondents become extinguished, and they are entitled to receive under the provisions of said will only that portion of the fund or property remaining at the date of the testator's death. In Estate of Goodfellow, supra, the testatrix directed her executors "to proceed to obtain the sum of $5000.00 from my share of Dr. Dempster's estate, and to place it in the care of the Methodist Episcopal Conference . . . Said Conference being pledged never to use said $5000.00 except as part of an endowment fund for a school for Methodist ministers." The testatrix was a daughter of Doctor Dempster and one of his heirs. After the execution of her will, but prior to her death, however, the estate of her father had been closed and the prop-

200 Cal.—17 258 ESTATE OF B.A.BR. [200 Cal.
erty thereof finally distributed in accordance with the terms of his will. It was held that the legacy of $5,000 to the Methodist Episcopal Conference was adcemcd by the final settlement of said estate and the distribution to Mrs. Goodfellow of her interest therein prior to her death. For the same reason it must be held that the bequest to respondents was adeemed to the extent of the property of the Taylor estate distributed to the testator during his lifetime and said respondents are therefore entitled to receive under paragraph III of said will only such interest in the Taylor estate and the property thereof as existed at the date of the testator's death. We are, therefore, of the opinion that the probate court was in error in distributing to the respondents said sum of $4,048.20, received by said testator during his lifetime from the estate of Mary L. Taylor, deceased. Appellant herein was entitled to have said amount distributed to him under the terms of said will, whereby he was given all the money of said testator on deposit in any bank at the date of the death of said testator.

[5] Appellant further contends that a similar error was made by said court in distributing to respondents said sum of $4,620, being the proceeds received from said 70 shares of the capital stock of the Cincinnati Discount Company. These shares of stock, as we have already seen, were received by the testator from the Taylor estate during the lifetime of the testator and comprised a portion of his estate at the date of his death. The appellant, under the will of the deceased, was given only the money belonging to said deceased and deposited in any bank and such money as said testator had loaned out. He was, therefore, not entitled to any of the proceeds received from said 70 shares of stock, and if any error was made by the court in distributing said proceeds to respondents, the appellant is not a party aggrieved thereby except to the extent hereinafter considered, which does not necessitate a reversal of said order, but at most a modification thereof. While appellant concedes that he was not entitled to any of the proceeds derived from said shares of stock, he contends that said proceeds should be distributed solely to the respondents, Harriet B. Sargent and Lucy S. Boyd, as residuary legatees under paragraph VI of testator's will and not to all of the respondents herein under para- Jan. 1927.]                                                                 Esate of Babb.                                                                 259

graph III of said will. [6] He further contends that had such proceeds been distributed to the said residuary legatees, it would have been the duty of said court to have deducted from the said proceeds the debts of said deceased, his funeral expenses, and the expenses of administration before making any distribution of the residue thereof, and that only the residue of said proceeds should have been distributed to said residuary legatees. It appears from the record that the entire property of the estate was distributed to the several legatees and devisees named in said will and that said distribution was made of the several parts or portions of said estate as special bequests or devises and that said court apportioned the debts of said deceased, the funeral expenses, and the expenses of administration among the several devises and legatees in proportion to the amount of property which each one of them received, and that the portion which appellant was required to pay under this plan was the sum of $901.21, which amount was deducted from the amount of the legacies bequeathed to appellant. It is the appellant's contention, therefore, that had the proceeds received by the executor from said shares of stock been distributed to the residuary legatees under paragraph VI of said will, he would not have been required to deduct from the amount of the legacies bequeathed to him said sum of $901.21. With this contention of appellant we must agree. As already indicated herein the respondents were not entitled to receive under paragraph III of said will any part of the money or property received by the testator during his lifetime from the estate of Mary L. Taylor, deceased. This property, as we have also seen, included said sum of $4,048.20 in money received directly from the Taylor estate and the $4,620 received by the executor as proceeds from said shares of stock, but by the terms of said will said sum of $4,048.20 should have been distributed to the appellant and the distribution of the said sum of $4,620 was governed by the provisions of paragraph VI of said will, bequeathing the residue of the said estate to the respondents, Harriet B. Sargent and Lucy L. Boyd. All the bequests and devises under said will, except that to the residuary legatees, were specific and that to the residuary legatees was general (Civ. 260 ESTATE OF BABB. [200 Cal.
Code, sec. 1357). Property bequeathed to a residuary legatee must be resorted to for the payment of the debts of the deceased, funeral expenses, and expenses of administration, prior to any resort being made to property specifically devised or bequeathed (Civ. Code, sec. 1359; Code Civ. Proc., sec. 1563). The debts of the testator, funeral expenses, and the expenses of administration in the present estate should, therefore, have been deducted in whole from the property bequeathed by said testator to the residuary legatees. It was accordingly error for the trial court to have provided in said decree of distribution for the payment by appellant of said sum of $901.21 as appellant's proportionate share of said debts, funeral expenses, and expenses of administration. The decree of distribution awarding the proceeds received by the executor from the shares of stock in the Cincinnati Discount Company to all of the respondents was not appealed from by the respondents, Harriet B. Sargent and Lucy S. Boyd, the residuary legatees, the parties aggrieved by said decree. It, therefore, in so far as the rights of these two respondents are concerned, is final and conclusive against them. Accordingly, it should not be reversed. It should be modified, however, by striking from said decree the provision thereof deducting from the amount distributed to appellant the sum of $901.21 as appellant's proportionate share of the debts of deceased, funeral expenses, and expenses of administration.

The appeal of the executor is dismissed. That portion of said decree of distribution distributing said sum of $4,048.20 to respondents is reversed, with directions to the probate court to enter its decree distributing to appellant the said sum of $4,048.20, in addition to the other sums of money and property distributed to appellant by said decree of distribution. Said decree of distribution is also directed to be modified by striking therefrom the provision contained therein deducting from the amount of the legacies bequeathed to appellant said sum of $901.21 as appellant's proportionate share of the debts of deceased, the funeral expenses, and expenses of administration. It is directed that such decree further provide that said sum of $901.21 be deducted from said sum of $4,620, and that the amount Jan. 1927.] MUCHENBERGER v. CITY OF SANTA MONICA. 261

remaining after making such deduction be distributed to respondents.

Newlin & Ashburn for Respondent Santa Monica Land Company.

RICHARDS, J.—The respondent herein, the Santa Monica Land Company, has presented a motion to strike out the reporter's transcript on both appeals herein, upon the ground that as to a certain portion of said transcript the official reporter was not present during the presentation to the trial court of the matters embraced in that particular portion thereof. The record herein discloses that the action in which these appeals were taken was one wherein the plaintiffs sought to compel the city of Santa Monica, as trustee, to perform the terms of a trust contained in that certain act of the legislature of the state of California known as "An act granting certain tidelands and submerged lands of the State of California to the City of Santa Monica upon certain trusts and conditions," approved April 10, 1917, and for such other and appropriate orders and decrees as should be meet in the premises; that upon the issues joined therein the cause came on for trial in the early part of the year 1925, before the court sitting without a jury, and that the trial of said cause lasted several days, during which oral and documentary evidence was received, and also during which main trial of the cause the official reporter of said court was present and reported the same; that on the fourth day of March, 1925, the cause was submitted to the court for decision upon the evidence theretofore taken; that on the twelfth day of May, 1925, the judge of said court filed an opinion wherein he indicated what his decision in said cause would be and that in the course of said opinion he indicated that there was a certain incidental matter relating to the details of certain work which the court suggested should be agreed upon by the parties and with reference to which the court indicated that, in the event of the failure of the parties to so agree, it would appoint two engineers, one to be named by the plaintiffs and one by defendants, who, with the city engineer of the City of Santa Monica, should prepare and present to the court their recommendation as to the details of such work. The parties not having agreed, the court appointed said engineers, and also and in order to receive their report, and evidently for that purpose alone, set aside the submis- Jan. 1927.] MUCHENBERGER v. CITY OF SANTA MONICA. 263

sion of the cause and continued the further hearing thereon for that particular purpose until such time as such report could be prepared and presented. The matter came on for hearing thereon on September 21, 1925, whereupon the report of said engineers, after being identified and verified by them, was presented and received in evidence by the court. At the time of the presentation thereof at said hearing the official reporter was not present and the report of said engineers was received and filed without his presence, but with the knowledge of all parties concerned that he was not present at said time, and without either suggestion or objection on the part of any of them. Thereafter and on the first day of December, 1925, the court filed its findings of fact and conclusions of law in said cause and also caused to be made and entered its judgment therein. The plaintiffs appealed from the whole of said judgment, while the City of Santa Monica also filed its appeal from certain designated portions thereof. Both of these appellants united in the request to the official reporter for the preparation of the reporter's transcript on both appeals, and such transcript was accordingly prepared and certified by such reporter in so far as the same related to the main trial of said cause down to the date of the first submission thereof. The said transcript as presented to the judge of the trial court for his approval and certification also was made to contain the order of the court for the reopening of the cause for the special purpose of receiving the report of said engineers and the proceedings at the time of the reception in evidence of said report. When the matter of the settlement of said reporter's transcript came on for hearing before the trial court the respondent Santa Monica Land Company objected to the settlement of the same, basing its objection upon the ground that since no official reporter had been present when the written report of said engineers was identified and received in evidence no transcript could be prepared or settled upon said appeal under the alternative method provided in section 953a of the Code of Civil Procedure. The trial judge took the matter of the settlement of said transcript and the aforesaid objection thereto under advisement and thereafter and on April 12, 1926, appended thereto the following certificate: 264 MUCHENBERGER v. CITY OF SANTA MONICA. [200 Cal.

"I hereby certify that the foregoing transcript, from pages 1 to 466, both inclusive, consisting of one volume, in the above proceedings, is true and correct; except that the case was reopened on the 21st day of September, 1925, for the sole purpose of receiving the reports of the engineers appointed under the order for reopening, and taking their evidence as to the correctness of the same. At said hearing on September 21, 1925, no evidence was taken from any witness save from said engineers, and that only as to the correctness of their reports. The order reopening the cause and the proceedings had thereon are incorporated in the foregoing transcript at pages 467 to 481, inclusive."

The respondents herein renew their said objections to the reporter's transcript and the settlement thereof and to the use thereof upon these appeals by their said motion to strike said transcript and the whole thereof from the files. [1] We are of the opinion that this motion should be denied. It is addressed to the reporter's transcript herein as a whole. A reference to the foregoing certificate of the trial judge will show that he has duly certified to the correctness of said reporter's transcript as to the whole of that portion thereof which embraces the main trial of the cause and the proceedings had thereon and that as to the remainder of the certificate of said judge it refers to and identifies the proceedings had upon the supplemental hearing ordered by said court for the limited purpose of receiving the report of its appointed engineers upon a merely incidental phase of said case arising after the trial and submission of the main cause. While it is probably true that the official reporter should have been present and have reported this supplemental proceeding, we are of the opinion that his absence therefrom, with the apparent knowledge and consent of all parties concerned, ought not to so far avail as to justify the granting of the respondents' motion to strike out the entire transcript herein, in view of the fact that that portion thereof which fully embraces the main proceedings during the trial of the cause was properly certified by the trial judge as being true and correct. We are of the opinion that as to the supplemental portion of said transcript which forms the basis of the respondents' assault upon the whole thereof, that portion thereof is so far severable from the remainder of said transcript as to be disregarded in determining whether there Jan. 1927.] ROBINET v. HAWKS. 265

is a sufficiently certified transcript of the cause on file as to enable the court to decide these appeals upon their merits. In presenting this motion the respondents have proffered no objection impugning the correctness of that portion of said transcript which embodies the proceedings had at the time of the receipt of the report of said engineers. Since the respondents herein are insisting upon the correctness of the judgment of said court in its entirety, it must be assumed that they have been beneficially affected by whatever portion of said judgment relates to or is based upon the report of said engineers, and this being so, and said respondents having tacitly consented to the presentation and admission in evidence of said engineers' report in the absence of the official reporter, we are of the opinion that they are not now in a position to press said motion without some showing that they have been injuriously affected by the action of the trial judge in making his foregoing certification of said transcript.

It is, therefore, ordered that the said motion be and the same is hereby denied.

[1] NEGLIGENCE—EMPLOYER AND EMPLOYEE—DEFENSES—ASSUMPTION OF RISK—ROSEBERRY ACT.—Under the Roseberry Act, assumption of the risk of the employment is no defense to an action by an employee against his employers for damages for alleged negligence, and the doctrine of relative negligence modifies the old rule of contributory negligence.

[2] Id.—WANT OF ORDINARY OR REASONABLE CARE OF EMPLOYER—CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE OF EMPLOYEE.—Under the Roseberry Act, an employee may recover if he is injured in the course of his

[200 Cal.

employment through the want of ordinary or reasonable care of the employer; and in such cases the fact that the employee may have been guilty of contributory negligence does not bar a recovery where his contributory negligence was slight and the negligence of the employer was gross in comparison.

[3] Id.—ACTION BY FARM HAND—NEGLIGENCE OF EMPLOYER.—In an action by a teamster, whose duty it was to drive a team in an orchard to gather loaded boxes of fruit, for damages for injuries received by him when thrown from the wagon by a sudden lurch, the jury was justified in finding the defendants negligent in allowing a deep hole in the ground to remain where the employee was expected to go, into which the wagon-wheel sank to the hub, throwing the employee to the ground, the view of which hole was hidden by the presence of grasses and weeds, also in not providing a wagon which had either a seat or a stanchion or some other device with which the employee might steady himself in case of emergency, and in providing no means of holding the boxes of fruit on the wagon floor to prevent the bottom layer of boxes from sliding off in case of a sudden lurch or tilting of the wagon.

[4] Id.—CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE.—In such an action, it cannot be said as a matter of law that the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence, to say nothing of gross negligence, in sitting on three of the fruit boxes piled one upon the other, to a height from forty-five to fifty inches, and thus driving the team, with no seat, stanchion, or other device by which he could hold on or steady himself.

[5] Id.—GROSS OR CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE—QUESTIONS FOR JURY.—In such a case, the questions of gross or contributory negligence, like the question of negligence on the part of the plaintiff, are proper questions, under the evidence, for the consideration of the jury alone.

[6] Id.—INSTRUCTIONS—ASSUMPTION OF RISK—DEGREE OF CARE.—An instruction to the jury, in such a case, which, standing alone, would be erroneous in that it excludes application of the principle that the employers are required to exercise only reasonable care in seeing that the place and tools of employment provided for their employees are safe, is not prejudicial to the employers, where all the instructions, when read as a whole, are not erroneous and are in reality more favorable to the defendants than the law requires.

[7] Id.—EVIDENCE—CUSTOM.—In such a case, there was no injury to the defendants in sustaining objection to a question as to whether it was customary to furnish anything for the teamsters to hold to on the wagon, where another witness was allowed to testify without objection to the method used by such teamsters.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Superior Court of Sacramento County. Malcolm C. Glenn, Judge. Affirmed.

The facts are stated in the opinion of the court.

White, Miller, Needham & Harber for Appellants.

Ray T. Coughlin and H. W. McGowan for Respondent.

PRESTON, J.—Defendants are farmers and owners of a team and wagon driven by plaintiff on defendants' ranch. Plaintiff was employed as a teamster collecting boxes of fruit, and was injured by being thrown off the wagon he was driving, along with the load of fruit thereon, for which injuries so sustained he sought judgment against defendants from the court sitting with a jury and charging defendants with negligence in and about the matters alleged in the complaint.

Defendants denied negligence and pleaded that the injuries received by plaintiff were solely the result of his own negligence. Upon the issues thus made the jury awarded plaintiff one thousand dollars in damages and the trial judge gave judgment on the verdict, from which judgment defendants have appealed.

Appellants urge that the evidence is such as to preclude a finding of negligence on the part of defendants; also that the evidence shows conclusively that the plaintiff's negligence was the sole cause of the injuries received by him; also that the court misdirected the jury in that it told them that defendants were insurers of the safety of their premises, and of the appliances used by plaintiff as their employee; and

8. See 19 Cal. Jur. 581. 268 ROBINET v. HAWKS. [200 Cal.

lastly, that the evidence offered by defendants to the effect that the equipment and appliances furnished plaintiff by the defendants were those customarily used for such purposes was erroneously excluded by the court. We shall discuss these questions in the order named.

It must be borne in mind that the relationship here between the parties is that of employer and employee, which makes what is known as the Roseberry Act (Stats. 1911, p. 796) applicable, excluding, however, from operation herein the so-called Workmen's Compensation Act. (Stats. 1913, p. 279.)

[1] Under the Roseberry Act assumption of the risk is no defense to an action of this character, and the doctrine of relative negligence modifies the old rule of contributory negligence. (Hackelberry v. Sherlock, 39 Cal. App. 764 [180 Pac. 37], where numerous cases are cited; Elder v. Rose, 63 Cal. App. 545 [219 Pac. 74].)

[2] Under this act plaintiff may recover if he is injured while in the course of his employment through "the want of ordinary or reasonable care of the employer," and in such cases "the fact that such employee may have been guilty of contributory negligence shall not bar a recovery therein where his contributory negligence was slight and that of the employer was gross in comparison."

As we have seen, the plaintiff was employed by the defendants as a teamster, his duties being to drive along between the rows of peach trees, gather up the loaded boxes and drive them to the place desired by the employer. Plaintiff's duties were purely those of driving the team, as he had helpers in other departments of the work. On the morning of the accident he was instructed to drive a team attached to an ordinary farm wagon throughout the orchard for the purposes above stated. The wagon floor or bed was without sides other than a rim around it about four inches high, and there was no device by which the driver could hold on. Portions of the territory over which he drove the team were covered with Bermuda grass and weeds, the latter being, as certain witnesses testified, about three feet high. The ground was rough, and it was admitted that the orchard had been irrigated by means of ridges thrown up by a disc and also by ditches; that after the irrigation sea- Jan. 1927.] ROBINET v. HAWKS. 269

son was over these ridges had not been smoothed down. One witness testified that it was customary in the vicinity, before the harvesting season began, to smooth down the ground so as to permit the access of teams along the rows of trees.

The evidence also showed that there may have been irrigation ditches left open, wash-out holes, called by some "cat-holes," and holes caused by the taking out of old trees in the orchard preparatory to the planting of new trees therein; also that in places where these grasses and weeds were, the ordinary eye could not detect the presence of wash-outs or holes.

The evidence showed that on the day of the accident, while driving through the orchard, and upon making a turn therein, the wagon gave a lurch, which threw the plaintiff, together with his load of fruit, violently to the ground, rendering plaintiff unconscious for a short period of time and giving him the injuries complained of. When plaintiff finally recovered his senses and investigated his condition he found the wagon with one wheel in a hole, hub-deep, with the surrounding ground rough, and with weeds which may well have obscured plaintiff's view. Also about half the orchard was in a similar condition as to grasses, weeds, and roughness.

Plaintiff testified that he was a careful driver, with thirty-five years' experience, and that he had never experienced any trouble before in executing his work. He admitted, however, that at the time of the accident he was sitting on top of three of the lug-boxes, piled one on top of the other. The height of each of these boxes is some fifteen or sixteen inches.

There was no evidence that defendants or their employees had any actual notice that the hole existed by reason of which plaintiff was injured, but it is admitted that no effort was made to smooth down the irrigation ridges and that defendants relied upon the presence of the wagon-wheels to smooth down these ridges, which they said were of a sandy material.

[3] It is too clear for controversy that the jury would have been warranted in believing all or either of the following propositions: (1) That it was negligence on the part 270 ROBINET v. HAWKS. [200 Cal.

of defendants to allow a hole deep enough to bury a wagon-wheel to the hub to remain upon the premises where servants were expected to go, with the view thereof hidden by the presence of grasses and weeds; or (2) that defendants were negligent in not providing a wagon which either had a seat or a stanchion or some other device thereon with which the employee might steady himself in case of emergency; or, indeed, (3) that it was negligence on the part of defendants to have no means of holding the boxes on the wagon floor which would at least prevent the bottom layer of boxes from sliding off in case of a sudden lurch or tilting of the wagon.

There is, in our opinion, ample evidence warranting the jury in finding negligence on the part of defendants, and this by a "country-bred" jury as well as by a "town-bred" jury, of which latter type defendants complain. Negligence was properly defined by the court to the jury, and, therefore, no reason appears for setting aside the verdict of the jury for insufficiency of evidence of negligence on the part of defendants.

[4] Appellants further contend that even if negligence might be inferred it was slight as compared with the gross negligence of plaintiff in sitting down on the seat made by three of the fruit boxes piled one upon the other and driving the team while thus sitting, with no seat, stanchion, or other device by which he could hold on or steady himself. However, with the combined height of the three boxes being only from forty-five to fifty inches, we cannot say as a matter of law that the plaintiff was guilty of any contributory negligence, to say nothing of gross negligence.

It must be remembered that the boxes were filled with fruit. As we understand it, the packing was done in the following manner: A row of lug-boxes were filled with fruit and were stacked lengthwise along the center of the floor of the wagon and then on either side of the center line boxes were also packed along the side at right angles to the center line rows, with the outside end of each box tilted to the height of the rim or border around the floor bed of said wagon. This method would, if anything, make the center row of boxes the steadiest part of the entire load. Whether with three of these center rows and the plaintiff Jan. 1927.] ROBINET v. HAWKS. 271

leaning against them while standing would have placed him in less danger than if seated is indeed hard to say, but we are satisfied that the jury was warranted in finding that some better method should have been provided for the safety of plaintiff when driving a team with a wagon loaded with boxes of fruit stored thereon in the manner herein described, and that plaintiff was not guilty of gross negligence in being seated on the boxes at the time of the accident.

[5] We are also satisfied that such cases as *Hontz v. San Pedro*, 173 Cal. 750 [161 Pac. 971], have no application to the facts of this case. The questions of gross or contributory negligence, like the question of negligence on the part of plaintiff, were proper questions, under the evidence, for the consideration of the jury alone, and no reason exists for our interference therewith. (*Moore v. Pacific Coast Steel Co.*, 171 Cal. 489 [153 Pac. 912]; *Scherer v. Danziger*, 178 Cal. 253 [173 Pac. 85]; *Lassen v. Southern Pac. Co.*, 173 Cal. 71 [159 Pac. 143].)

[6] Complaint is also made of the following instruction to the jury: "While the servant must use ordinary care and assumes the risks of his employment he is not obliged to do anything further and the employer is liable to the employee for injuries caused from defective or unsafe appliances or places of employment especially when the defects and the dangers were unknown to the employee and were not obvious to his view.

"If you find from the evidence in this case that such was the situation here, under the instructions as I have given them to you, your verdict should be for the plaintiff."

The criticism is that the jury in practical effect were told that the defendants were insurers of the safety of plaintiff and that the elements of reasonable care and prudence were excluded from the case. The instruction is poorly drafted and not properly balanced, and if standing alone we would say it was erroneous. It is a misstatement of the doctrine of assumption of risk to the detriment of plaintiff, and standing alone it would permit also the criticism of defendants, in that it excludes application of the principle that defendants are only required to exercise reasonable care in seeing that the place and tools of employment provided for their employees must be safe. We are also aware of the rule 272 ROBINET v. HAWKS. [200 Cal.

expressed by the court as follows in the case of Starr v. Los Angeles Ry. Corp., 187 Cal. 270, 278 [201 Pac. 599]: "The rule is that where an instruction directs a verdict for plaintiff if the jury finds certain facts to be true, it must embrace all the things necessary to show the legal liability of the defendant and to warrant the direction or conclusion that the plaintiff is entitled to a verdict. (Pierce v. United Gas & Electric Co., 161 Cal. 176, 184 [118 Pac. 700], citing Killelea v. California etc. Co., 140 Cal. 602 [74 Pac. 157].)"

To the same effect is Fidelity etc. Co. v. Paraffine Paint Co., 188 Cal. 184, 192 [204 Pac. 1076].

But it will be noted that said above-quoted instruction does not undertake to be a so-called "formula" instruction, for it contains within it these saving words "If you find from the evidence in this case that such was the situation here, under the instructions as I have given them to you . . ." Elsewhere in the instructions the court proceeds to say:

"A master is bound to use reasonable care to prevent injuries to his servants in the course of their employment. . . .

"The care required of an employer is that of reasonable diligence; and reasonable diligence implies as between the employer and employee such watchfulness, caution and foresight as under all circumstances of the particular service an ordinarily careful, prudent and cautious man would exercise . . . and if you find from the evidence and under these instructions that the defendant was so negligent and the plaintiff was not guilty of any contributory negligence your verdict should be for the plaintiff.

"You are instructed that under the law of the State of California the defendant as an employer was bound at all times to exercise ordinary care in furnishing a reasonably safe place for his employee to work in and if, in the present instance, he failed to do so and by reason thereof the plaintiff without negligence on his part, sustained injuries, the defendant is liable.

"It is the duty of all employers to furnish reasonably safe places in which the employees may perform their work, and to use ordinary care to keep the place reasonably safe so Jan. 1927.] ROBINET v. HAWKS. 273

that the employee may not be exposed to danger. . . . While he is not an insurer of the safety of the employees he must use ordinary care in seeing that the place is safe in the first place and to employ the same degree of care to keep it such.

"The Court instructs the jury that if the plaintiff's injuries were the result of a pure accident, such as could not ordinarily be anticipated, and not the result of the negligence of either the plaintiff or the defendant, then the plaintiff cannot recover. He cannot recover at all unless his injuries were caused by the negligence of the defendant."

We therefore readily conclude that when the instructions are read together they are not erroneous, especially to the injury of defendants, but that they are in reality more favorable to defendants than the law required, for in addition to the statement that plaintiff assumed the risk of his employment, which is not the law, the instructions also keep in the case the old doctrine of contributory negligence before any modification was made in favor of the employee.

[7] Likewise there is no substance in the contention concerning the rulings of the court in the rejection of certain evidence. During the examination of A. S. Hawk, one of the defendants herein, a juror propounded questions indicating that he was interested in the question as to whether the bed of the wagon had sides thereon, to which question defendant replied that there were no sides on the wagon, for if there were a man could not lift the fruit over them. The juror also wanted to know if the driver of the team had anything to catch hold of, and the reply to this question was in the negative, whereupon counsel for this witness propounded to him this question: "Q. Is it customary to have sides on the wagon collecting fruit in an orchard? A. No, If there were, we could not get the fruit up there." The above answer was made without objection, whereupon the following question was asked: "Is it customary to furnish anything for the teamster to hold on to on the wagon?" Objection was made that the question was "irrelevant, immaterial, and incompetent" and the court sustained the objection, stating that he did not think it was material; that the issue was what was done in this particular case rather than what the custom was. We are unable to see any error whatsoever in this ruling of the trial court.

200 Cal.—18 274 FOSTER v. FERNANDES. [200 Cal.

[8] In the first place the doctrine of customary usage does not, to our knowledge, apply to the question of legal duty under the law of negligence. In *Perry v. Angelus Hospital Assn.*, 172 Cal. 311, 315 [156 Pac. 449], we say: "We know of no authority for the proposition that by continuing in a careless performance of duty a party transforms its negligence into due care. (Silviera v. Iverson, 125 Cal. 266 [57 Pac. 996].)"

In the second place, the wife of the defendant, Mrs. Rose Hawk, testified, without objection, at length as to the method used by the teamsters with wagons of this character. She said some teamsters sat down upon the floor of the wagon with their feet hanging off and others stood up while driving and leaned against the load of boxes; that she was not sure, but that she did not think any of them ever sat down upon the boxes while driving, although she was not sure of it. In other words, her entire testimony was in legal effect testimony as to the custom of drivers of wagons of that type in the harvesting of fruit and the gathering of fruit boxes. There was no possible injury, therefore, to defendants by sustaining this objection.

Judgment affirmed.

G. W. Zartman and Russell & Heid for Appellants.

Feemster & Cleary for Respondent.

THE COURT.—Upon submission of the cause in open court, the Chief Justice announced the decision of the court as follows:

In this action to recover certain cattle, or the value thereof, together with damages for their wrongful detention, judgment was entered for plaintiff. After motion for new trial made and denied, defendants gave notice of appeal, and, in due time, filed an undertaking on appeal in the sum of fifteen thousand dollars, properly conditioned to stay execution. Thereafter the respondent having excepted to the sufficiency of the sureties, appellants served notice that the sureties would justify before the court on the third day of December, 1926, on which day they appeared in court with the sureties. After due examination, the trial court found the sureties were qualified to act as such, but refused to permit them to justify on the ground that they appeared one day too late, the delay being explained by the fact that the appellants erroneously believed they had until December 3, 1926, within which to have said sureties justify. Execution was thereupon issued on behalf of the plaintiff upon the judgment entered in the cause, and the appellants have applied to this court for writ of supersedeas.

[1] Under the rule stated in *Nonpareil Mfg. Co. v. McCartney*, 143 Cal. 1 [76 Pac. 653], and *Segarini v. Bargagliotti*, 193 Cal. 538 [226 Pac. 2], good faith having been shown by appellants, we deem it proper, in the exercise of sound discretion, to grant them the writ prayed for, upon such terms as will be just and will adequately protect the rights of the respondent, in order to preserve the status quo until the final determination of the action.

It is ordered that, upon the filing by petitioners, with the clerk of this court, within fifteen days, of a good and suffi- 276 GLOBE COTTON OIL MILLS v. ZELLERBACH. [200 Cal.

cient undertaking on appeal in the sum of fifteen thousand dollars, conditioned as required by law, and which shall have been first approved by a judge of the superior court in and for the county of Tulare, at a hearing upon five days' notice to respondent, a writ shall issue as prayed for herein.

It is further ordered that in the meantime, during said period of fifteen days, the execution of the judgment referred to in the petition be stayed.

John L. Dyer and Warren H. Pillsbury for Petitioner.

B. D. Marx Greene for Respondents.

THE COURT.—Upon submission of the cause in open court the Chief Justice announced the decision of the court as follows:

The petitioner, owning and operating a fish reduction plant at Terminal Island, San Pedro Harbor, seeks a writ Jan. 1927.] ISLAIS CREEK REC. DIST. v. ALL PERSONS. 277

of mandate to compel the respondent Fish and Game Commission to set for hearing and to act on the application filed with the Commission by petitioner for a permit authorizing it to use in its plant the quantity of fish designated in the application, for the purposes therein specified. The Commission has refused to entertain jurisdiction of the application upon the ground that it is a nonjudicial body, and that to act as requested by the petitioner would be to exercise judicial functions. In assuming this position the respondent relies upon Van Camp Sea Food Co. v. Fish & Game Com., 75 Cal. App. 764 [243 Pac. 702], in which it was held that a Commission like the Fish and Game Commission, which is one having a state-wide jurisdiction, as distinguished from a local board, cannot be invested with judicial functions, for the reason that, "except for local purposes," section 1 of article VI of the constitution confines all judicial power to certain specified courts.

[1] This court is of the view, however, that, admitting that the Fish and Game Commission cannot be granted any power which constitutionally belongs exclusively to the judicial department of the state government, the granting of power to hold hearings and determine facts incidental to the regulation of fish and game, and to the granting of permits to take and use fish, is valid as an administrative or regulatory power, and in nowise transgresses upon the exclusive functions of the judicial department.

Let the writ of mandate issue as prayed for.

ISLAIS CREEK RECLAMATION DISTRICT, Respondent, v. ALL PERSONS, etc., et al., Appellants.

[1] RECLAMATION DISTRICTS—POLICE POWER—ACTION BY LEGISLATURE—PRESUMPTION OF KNOWLEDGE—DETERMINATION OF BENEFITS.—The creation of a reclamation district is an exercise of the police power of the state; and the legislature, which has the power to create, is presumed to act with knowledge of the facts and upon

1. See 9 Cal. Jur. 847. 278 ISLAIS CREEK REC. DIST. v. ALL PERSONS. [200 Cal.

a determination of the benefits to the land included within the boundaries of such a district by the proposed work of reclamation.

[2] Id.—STATUTORY CONSTRUCTION—CONSTITUTIONAL LAW.—An act of the legislature should not be declared unconstitutional by the courts unless its provisions are clearly violative of some provision of the constitution; and the courts of this state have liberally construed acts of the legislature creating reclamation and other improvement districts, because of the public benefit derived therefrom.

[3] Id.—ISLAIS CREEK RECLAMATION DISTRICT—PURPOSE OF.—The purposes of the Islais Creek Reclamation District clearly bring the act creating the district within the scope of the power of the legislature.

[4] Id.—PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS—CONTRIBUTION TO GENERAL WELFARE. Whatever tends to enlarge the resources, increase the industrial energies, and promote the productive power of any considerable number of the inhabitants of a section of the state, or which leads to the growth of towns and the creation of new sources for the employment of private capital and labor, indirectly contributes to the general welfare and to the prosperity of the whole community.

[5] Id.—PROMOTION OF COMMERCE AND NAVIGATION—DRAINAGE AND RECLAMATION—EXERCISE OF POLICE POWER.—Commerce and navigation generally, and particularly in the harbor of San Francisco, will be benefited by the improvement contemplated by the Islais Creek Reclamation District Act; but the drainage and reclamation of the lands, apart from any question of commerce or navigation, are in themselves a legitimate exercise of the police power of the state.

[6] Id.—PLAN AND PROVISION FOR WORKS—POWER OF LEGISLATURE.—It was within the power of the legislature, in creating the Islais Creek Reclamation District by a special act, to define the manner and plan and provide for the necessary works by which the contemplated reclamation should be carried out.

[7] Id.—ASSESSMENTS—PUBLIC PURPOSE—BENEFIT TO FEW.—While all assessments must be made for a public purpose, it is no objection to the constitutionality of a reclamation district act that the public benefit which is to be subserved is practically limited to those in the district whose lands are to be protected; and the state has the power to impose upon the adjacent lands specially benefited by the work an assessment in proportion to such benefits to defray part of the costs.

[8] Id. — TITLE OF ACT — CONSTITUTIONAL LAW. — The Islais Creek Reclamation District Act, which provides that the district may fill the land and streets therein held in private ownership and raise them to the official street grades as the same may be now or hereafter legally established, does not violate section 24, article IV, of the constitution, because the title does not specifically refer to the filling in of the lands and streets, the title being broad enough to disclose that the general purpose of the act is to provide a scheme for the betterment of the lands lying within the described area.

[9] Id. — FIXING OF BOUNDARIES OF DISTRICT — DETERMINATION OF BENEFITS. — Where the legislature itself fixes the exterior boundaries of a reclamation district, its determination as to the property benefited and the property to be included in the district is final and conclusive, and an attempt by an owner of lands in the district to show that they were not overflowed lands, in a proceeding to determine the legality of the district, would be futile.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Superior Court of the City and County of San Francisco. T. I. Fitzpatrick, Judge. Affirmed.

The facts are stated in the opinion of the court.

Joseph T. O'Connor and Sylvester J. McAtee for Appellants.

Allen G. Wright and Wright & Wright & Stetson for Respondent.

WASTE, C. J. — The Islais Creek Reclamation District, situate wholly within the city and county of San Francisco, was created by the legislature by statute, without reference or notice to the inhabitants of the district (Stats. 1925, p. 87). Under the authority of the statute creating it the

9. See 9 Cal. Jur. 865. 280 ISLAIS CREEK REC. DIST. v. ALL PERSONS. [200 Cal.

district commenced a proceeding in the superior court to determine the legality of its existence. The defaults of the state of California and of all persons other than the defendants Simpson were entered, and the cause was submitted on an agreed statement of facts. The lower court adjudged the plaintiff to be a legal reclamation district, duly created and organized, and having the statutory powers and authority conferred upon it. The defendants Simpson have appealed, contending that the act creating the district, by imposing a tax upon their lands, violates the provisions of the state and federal constitutions and amounts to a taking of property without due process of law.

[1] The appellants who are owners of real property within the boundaries of the district, concede, as they must, that the creation of a reclamation district is an exercise of the police power of the state, and that the legislature, which has the power to create, is presumed to act with knowledge of the facts and upon a determination of the benefits to the land included within the boundaries of such a district by the proposed work of reclamation. (See *People ex rel. Chapman v. Sacramento Drainage Dist.*, 155 Cal. 373 [103 Pac. 207].) [2] They also concede the full weight of authority to the effect that an act of the legislature should not be declared unconstitutional by the courts unless its provisions are clearly violative of some provision of the constitution, and recognize that the courts of this state have liberally construed acts of the legislature creating reclamation and other improvement districts, because of the public benefit derived therefrom. (*In re Bonds of Madera Irr. Dist.*, 92 Cal. 296, 311 et seq. [27 Am. St. Rep. 106, 14 L. R. A. 755, 28 Pac. 272, 675].) [3] After making these concessions, however, and arguing from a premise that "the original purpose of reclamation districts was the unwatering of lands and in the beginning of such legislation had application more especially to agricultural lands," and that "reclamation is practically synonymous with drainage," appellants contend that, in enacting the present statute, the legislature has distorted the "original purpose for which reclamation districts were created." Assuming some other word than "reclamation" might have been used, such, for instance, as "improvement," in describing the nature of the district created, we do not seriously regard the appellants' Jan. 1927.] ISLAIS CREEK REC. DIST. v. ALL PERSONS. 281

contention. The purpose and scope of the act are clearly discernible from a reading of it. It is entitled, in part, "An act to aid commerce and navigation by authorizing certain improvements in and about Islais creek and as a means thereof creating a reclamation district to be called and known as the 'Islais creek reclamation district,' . . . and authorizing a method for the reclamation of the lands of said district. . . . " In section 1 it is declared that in order "to aid commerce and navigation it is necessary to dredge Islais creek in the city and county of San Francisco, to dredge the shoals in the bay of San Francisco lying off the mouth of Islais creek, and to reclaim the old salt marsh and tidelands now lying in the district hereinafter described so that they may become a useful adjunct to commerce and navigation . . . a reclamation district is hereby created. . . . " These purposes clearly bring the act creating the district within the scope of the power of the legislature.

[4] Whatever "'tends to enlarge the resources, increase the industrial energies, and promote the productive power of any considerable number of the inhabitants of a section of the state, or which leads to the growth of towns and the creation of new sources for the employment of private capital and labor, indirectly contributes to the general welfare and to the prosperity of the whole community.'" (In re Bonds of Madera Irr. Dist., supra, at p. 314.) [5] Commerce and navigation generally, and particularly in the harbor of San Francisco, will be benefited by the improvement contemplated by this act; but the drainage and reclamation of the lands, apart from any question of commerce or navigation, are in themselves a legitimate exercise of the police power of the state. (Gray v. Reclamation Dist. No. 1500, 174 Cal. 622, 638 [163 Pac. 1024].)

[6] By section 9 of the act, Islais Creek Reclamation District is given the power to reclaim and protect the lands of the district by making, constructing, and maintaining such fills, drains, canals, sluices, bulkheads, water-gates, levees, embankments, and pumping plants as, in the opinion of the trustees of the district, are or may be necessary to the general plans as decided upon by the trustees. It was within the power of the legislature, in creating the district by special act, to define the manner and plan and provide for the necessary works by which the contemplated reclamation 282 ISLAIS CREEK REC. DIST. v. ALL PERSONS. [200 Cal.

should be carried out. (Reclamation Dist. v. Superior Court, 171 Cal. 672, 678 [154 Pac. 845].)

[7] All assessments must be made for a public purpose. Appellants therefore argue that while it may be conceded to be of local benefit to create an industrial district where now is marsh-land, this is purely a private industrial enterprise or venture, the indirect benefit to the public from which should not be used as a cloak for the exercise of the police power of the state to impose a burden of taxation upon the lands of a citizen. This court said in *In re Bonds of Madera Irr. Dist., supra*, at p. 310, that "whenever it is apparent from the scope of the act that its object is for the benefit of the public, and that the means by which the benefit is to be attained are of a public character, the act will be upheld, even though incidental advantages may accrue to individuals beyond those enjoyed by the general public." It is no objection to the constitutionality of the statute that the public benefit which is to be subserved is practically limited to those in the district whose lands are to be protected. (*Laguna etc. Dist. v. Martin Co.*, 144 Cal. 209, 217 [77 Pac. 933].) It may be assumed that the lands held in private ownership within the district, which, without the improvements contemplated by the creation of the district, will be marsh and overflowed lands, will be especially benefited by the contemplated improvement. But it may not be denied that the state has the power to impose upon the adjacent lands specially benefited by the work an assessment in proportion to such benefits to defray part of the costs. (*People, etc., v. Sacramento Drainage Dist., supra.*)

[8] Under the provisions of section 9 of the act the district may fill the land therein held in private ownership and the streets lying therein, and thereby raise them to the official street grades as the same may be now or hereafter legally established. Because the title does not specifically refer to the filling in of the lands-and streets, appellants contend that the act is a violation of section 24, article IV of the constitution, which provides that every act shall embrace but one subject, which subject shall be expressed in its title. The objection is not well taken. The title is broad enough in its language to disclose that the general purpose of the act is to provide a scheme for the betterment of the lands lying within the described area. Such aspects of the reclamation Jan. 1927.] ISLAIS CREEK REC. DIST. v. ALL PERSONS. 283

and improvement of the land as are set forth in the act, if falling within and germane to the general purposes announced by the title, do not require expression in the title. (People, etc., v. Sacramento Drainage Dist., supra, at p. 384; People v. Jordan, 172 Cal. 391, 394 [156 Pac. 451]; Estate of Wellings, 192 Cal. 506, 519 [221 Pac. 628].)

[9] It was a stipulated fact in the case that the lands in this district were at one time all swamp and overflowed lands, or lands subject to overflow, and the greater part thereof are still of that character. The fact that they are not all of such character at the present time does not affect the validity of the district. Appellants did not attempt, in the court below, to show that their holdings in the district were not overflowed lands. Any attempt to show that fact would have been futile, for the legislature itself fixed the exterior boundaries of the district, and included the appellants' land therein. Its determination as to the property benefited and the property to be included in the district was final and conclusive. (Brookes v. City of Oakland, 160 Cal. 423, 427 [117 Pac. 433].)

We have referred to but a few of the many cases sustaining the legality of the Islais Creek Reclamation District on all contentions advanced by appellants. We find nothing in the points raised by appellants which renders the statute creating the district obnoxious to either the state or the federal constitution.

The judgment is affirmed.

# GENERAL MOTORS ACCEPTANCE CORPORATION (a Corporation), Respondent, v. C. W. GANDY, Appellant.

[1] ESTOPPEL—CONTRACTS—GUARANTY—INSUFFICIENCY OF EVIDENCE.—In this action to recover a certain sum on a contract of guaranty it is held that the evidence does not warrant the finding that the defendant is estopped by reason of his conduct with respect to the several transactions involved from denying his liability upon a contract sued upon.

[2] Id.—EQUITABLE ESTOPPEL—BURDEN OF PROOF.—The existence of an estoppel is a question of fact, and the settled rule as to the proof of equitable estoppel is that the burden rests upon the party asserting such estoppel to prove all the elements constituting it by evidence having some reasonable tendency to establish the fact.

[3] Id.—ELEMENTS OF ESTOPPEL—FALSE REPRESENTATIONS—CONCEALMENT.—Among the dominant essentials of equitable estoppel or estoppel *in pais* is that there must have been a false representation or a concealment of material facts of the matter as to which the estoppel is claimed, and the party to whom such representation was made or from whom such facts were concealed must have been ignorant, actually and permissibly, of the truth of the matter.

[4] Id.—PROOF—CHARACTER OF.—As an equitable estoppel must be proved, as a rule, by oral testimony, the rule that certainty is essential to all estoppels is peculiarly applicable to estoppels *in pais*, and it must be established so as to leave nothing to surmise or questionable inference; and the representations, whether express or implied from the conduct of the party against whom the estoppel is sought to be invoked, must be such as to justify a prudent man in acting upon them, and must be plain and not doubtful.

[5] Id.—SUCCESSIONS AND ASSIGNS.—It is held in this action that the record presents no question involving the heirs, administrators, successors, or assigns of the respective parties to the contract of guaranty.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Superior Court of Stanislaus County. J. C. Needham, Judge. Reversed.

The facts are stated in the opinion of the court.

A. J. Carlson for Appellant.

Charles W. Haswell and Haswell & Martin for Respondent.

LANGDON, J.—A petition for hearing in this court was granted in the above cause after decision by the district court of appeal, third appellate district. In said petition it was urged by the appellant that an important provision of the contract upon which the action was founded had been overlooked in the decision of the district court of appeal. No reply was made to this petition by the respondent. After careful consideration of the entire record we are of the opinion that the decision of the district court of appeal, third appellate district, written by Mr. Justice Hart, correctly states the law of this case and considers every material legal element involved therein with the exception of one additional feature urged by the appellant upon its petition for hearing in this court, which we shall discuss hereinafter. Accordingly we accept and adopt the said decision of the district court of appeal, as follows:

"This action was brought by plaintiff to recover the sum of $3,063.65 alleged to be the amount due on a contract of guaranty executed by the defendant for the purpose of indemnifying the former against any loss which it might incur by reason of taking over by purchase certain notes or other evidences of indebtedness accruing in favor of a certain partnership with which the defendant was connected as a co-partner. The cause was tried by the court, sitting without a jury, and plaintiff was awarded judgment for the sum of $1,668.70, from which this appeal is prosecuted by the defendant upon a record made up in pursuance of the provisions of section 953a of the Code of Civil Procedure.

"The plaintiff, a corporation, as its name to an extent implies, is what is known as an acceptance corporation, engaged in the business of buying and discounting conditional contracts of sale of motor vehicles and promissory notes and 286 GENERAL MOTORS ACCEPT. CORP. v. GANDY. [200 Cal.

other written evidences of indebtedness given to dealers in such vehicles by those purchasing the same on credit.

"The defendant, at the time he executed the contract of guaranty upon which the plaintiff declares, and one J. A. Anderson were, as copartners and under the firm name of 'Modesto Motors Co.,' engaged, in the city of Modesto, in the business of selling the Oakland, the Davis, the Paige and the Haynes automobiles. The Oakland automobile was manufactured by a corporation known as the 'General Motors Corporation.' The copartnership arranged to discount its automobile paper—notes, conditional contracts of sale and other written evidences of indebtedness owing to it by purchasers of the automobiles from it on time credit—and to perfect said arrangement, and in pursuance of a demand by plaintiff therefor, the members of the partnership (defendant and Anderson) executed and delivered to plaintiff, on the 8th day of April, 1920, although the instrument was dated March 30, 1920, the contract of guaranty upon which this action is predicated. The said guaranty provides as follows:

"'In consideration of General Motors Acceptance Corporation, hereinafter called the "Corporation," hereinafter extending credit at any time and to any extent to Modesto Motor Co., hereinafter called the "Dealer," or to any one at the request or for the benefit of said Dealer, through issuing, drawing, accepting, endorsing, discounting, purchasing or acquiring any draft, note, acceptance, bill of exchange, letter of credit, or other instrument or obligation, for the account or the behalf of said Dealer, or hereafter refraining to any extent from enforcing any rights under any contract or arrangement entered into by said Dealer, and of other good and valuable consideration, the undersigned agrees to hold the Corporation harmless from, and does hereby unconditionally at all times guarantee the performance and payment at maturity of each and all drafts, notes, acceptances, bills of exchange, letters of credit, negotiable instruments and agreements and other obligations between the Dealer and the Corporation, heretofore or hereafter issued, drawn, accepted, executed, entered into, endorsed, discounted, purchased or acquired by the Corporation, for the account or in the behalf of said Dealer, including all costs, expenses and attorney's fees, heretofore or hereafter incurred by Jan. 1927.] GENERAL MOTORS ACCEPT. CORP. v. GANDY. 287

said Corporation, in connection with the default of said Dealer.

"This is a contract of continuing guaranty and, until canceled as hereinafter provided, shall not be limited to any amount, and shall at all times include the full indebtedness of the said Dealer to the said Corporation.

"The liability of the undersigned for any unpaid balance shall not be affected by any indulgence, compromise, settlement, extension of credit, or variation of terms, effected by or with the Dealer or any other person interested, nor by the amount of Dealer's obligations outstanding at any one time, nor by payments previously made by the Dealer or the undersigned, nor shall it be necessary for the Corporation to procure the consent of the undersigned or give any notice in reference thereto.

"The undersigned hereby does expressly waive and dispense with notice of acceptance of this guaranty, notices of nonpayment and nonperformance, notices of amount of indebtedness outstanding at any time, protests, demands and prosecutions of collection, foreclosure and possessory remedies.

"This guaranty is to remain in full force and effect until written notices of the withdrawal of the same has been served by the undersigned upon the Corporation at its principal office at New York City, provided that such withdrawal shall in no case be effective except as to new transactions subsequent to the actual receipt of such notice.

"The obligation of all parties signing this guaranty, where more than one, shall be joint and several.

"The benefits and obligations hereof shall extend to and bind the heirs, administrators, successors and assigns of the respective parties hereto.

"This guaranty and the performance thereunder shall be construed and determined according to the law of the State of New York."

"Gandy testified that the partnership held the agency in Modesto and adjacent territory of the Oakland, the Davis, the Paige and the Haynes cars; that the General Motors Corporation, as seen, manufacturer of the Oakland cars, finally objected to the partnership 'handling so many other makes of cars,' and it was hence decided by the partnership, or Gandy and Anderson, the sole members thereof, to organize a corporation and to transfer to such corporation the agencies 288 GENERAL MOTORS ACCEPT. CORP. v. GANDY. [200 Cal.

in Modesto of the Oakland and Davis automobiles; that in pursuance of this decision a corporation was by said parties formed on the 11th day of June, 1920—approximately two months after the above contract of guaranty was executed—under the name of Modesto Motor Company. The articles of incorporation were filed in the office of the county clerk of Stanislaus county on the 21st day of June, 1920. A short time after the organization of said corporation, so defendant continued to testify, the partnership transferred to the corporation the agencies for the Oakland and Davis cars and certain personal assets of the former to said corporation, consisting of "certain personal property and some automobiles." As a consideration for such transfer the stock of the corporation was issued to the copartners in the partnership, Gandy, the defendant, receiving, approximately, two-thirds of the stock, Anderson one-third, and one Bryan Milton one share thereof. Defendant testified that immediately upon the organization of the corporation he became president and his copartner in the said partnership, Anderson, became vice-president thereof. The Modesto Motor Co., partnership, and the Modesto Motor Co., corporation, occupied the same premises—that is, there were two buildings, Gandy testified, on one lot, but connected together, the entire premises being in the possession and under the control of the partnership, the front building, however, occupied by the corporation and the rear by the partnership. Both the Modesto Motor Co., a partnership, and the Modesto Motor Co., a corporation, were doing business on the same premises at the same time.

"The defendant, having been called by the plaintiff as a witness under section 2055 of the Code of Civil Procedure, a number of times stated that he severed his connection with the corporation some time in the fall of the year 1921. When testifying as a witness for himself, however, he stated that it was some time in the fall of 1920 that he severed his connection with said corporation by selling his stock therein to one Knorr, who became president thereof, and another party whose name he was unable to recall. The Modesto Motor Company, partnership, continued to carry on business in the same premises that were occupied by the corporation of the same name until the month of January, 1921, when the Gandy Motor Co., a corporation organized Jan. 1927.] GENERAL MOTORS ACCEPT. CORP. v. GANDY. 289

by defendant, took over the business of the Modesto Motor Co., partnership.

"Gandy, further testifying, stated that in the month of October, 1920, after the corporation was formed and he had sold and relinquished all interest he had in the said corporation, he and the Mr. Knorr spoken of above as the party succeeding to the presidency of the corporation, called on the manager of plaintiff in San Francisco, and that he, in the presence of Knorr, informed said manager that he (defendant) had disposed of his interest in the agency of the Oakland car; that Mr. Knorr was the president of the Modesto Motor Company, Inc., and that Knorr or said corporation would handle the Oakland cars from that time on in Modesto; that his partner, Anderson, would remain with the corporation, while he would control the Modesto Motor Co., partnership, until he discontinued the same, as he then contemplated, and turn over its business and the Paige and Haynes agencies in Modesto to a corporation he intended to organize under the name of Gandy Motor Company. Defendant stated that the plaintiff's manager asked him why 'we called it (the corporation) the "Modesto Motor Company, Incorporated," under the same name as our Company. I told him because we were going to discontinue the Modesto Company, a co-partnership, and that I was going into the Gandy Motor Company and that the agencies for the Paige and the Haynes would be turned over to the Gandy Motor Company and that Mr. Anderson was going to continue with the Modesto Motor Co., Incorporated, but I was leaving it altogether.' Defendant further testified that on the same occasion he asked plaintiff's manager 'to check up the contracts that were outstanding, and I told him I would personally see that the terms were carried out, but wouldn't go any further because I had nothing to do with the company'; that the manager gave him a statement of the status 'of the contracts that were outstanding, and I checked up my books and I followed each contract out to see that it was taken care of—that is,' he continued, 'I had the books and in a good many cases I collected the money and sent it in to the General Motors Acceptance Corporation. . . . The contracts that have been offered in evidence here (those upon which this action is founded), numbered "Exhibits 2 to 8," inclusive, were not in existence at that time.'

"Certain letters passing between plaintiff and the Modesto Motor Co., Inc., after the corporation was formed—those from the latter being signed by Knorr as president of said corporation—were introduced in evidence. The letters to plaintiff from the corporation were upon sheets of paper containing the following at the top thereof: 'Modesto Motor Co., Inc., 1204 Ninth Street, Modesto, California.' One of the letters from the plaintiff to the corporation, dated October 10, 1921, called for a guaranty covering contracts which might hereafter be taken over by plaintiff, and in said letter it was suggested that the guarantee, the form of which was enclosed with the letter, be executed by 'all the officers of the corporation.' The guaranty thus requested was executed by the officers of the corporation on the 4th day of November, 1921, and was forwarded to plaintiff with a letter from the corporation, dated November 7, 1921. Under date of October 9, 1920, the corporation addressed and mailed to the plaintiff the following letter or card:

" 'GMAC Form No. 517.

" 'Name Modesto Motor Co., Inc.

" 'Address 1204 9th St., Modesto.

" 'Dated Oct. 9, 1920.

"The defendant's testimony that the contracts for the sale of automobiles which plaintiff took over, and which are the bases of this action, were made by and between the Modesto Motor Company, Inc., and the purchasers, is not Jan. 1927.] GENERAL MOTORS ACCEPT. CORP. v. GANDY. 291

contradicted. In fact, the contracts themselves show this to be true. One of these contracts was dated and, therefore, presumptively executed, on the 11th day of December, 1921, seven days after the guaranty last hereinabove spoken of was executed.

"The complaint, after setting out *in haec verba* the contract of guaranty of April 8, 1920, alleges that 'plaintiff on the faith of said guaranty extended credit to the said Modesto Motor Company, a corporation, the principal named in said guaranty, by accepting, purchasing and acquiring certain notes, acceptances and conditional sales contracts, which said instruments were duly set over by the said Modesto Motor Company, a corporation, to the plaintiff herein, for a valuable consideration, and were purchased and acquired by the said plaintiff in the regular course of business with the said Modesto Motor Company, a corporation, and endorsed by said Modesto Motor Company, a corporation, through and by its duly authorized officers,' etc.; that the said notes, or the respective balances thereof, are now due and payable, but that the makers thereof, although demanded by plaintiff to do so, have 'wholly refused, neglected and omitted to pay the said balances,' etc.

"A demurrer, on both general and special grounds, was interposed by the defendant and the same overruled. Thereupon defendant filed an answer specifically denying the averments of the complaint, and also affirmatively declaring: That 'the contract of guaranty in said complaint set forth does not apply to or include or cover any of the contracts or notes referred to in plaintiff's complaint'; that he (defendant) 'is not responsible for the payment of any of the items or outstanding balances referred to in the complaint or set out in "Exhibit A of said complaint,"' which exhibit involves a bill of particulars setting forth in detail the balances respectively due on the promissory notes referred to in the complaint.

"The court found the existence of the partnership between Gandy and Anderson under the name of the 'Modesto Motor Company' during the period above mentioned, the organization of the corporation by the same parties under the same name, and that the two entities were operated for the period of time above indicated at the same time and place, and then found as follows: 292 GENERAL MOTORS ACCEPT. CORP. v. GANDY. [200 Cal.

"That the defendant, C. W. Gandy, did not serve any notice upon said General Motors Acceptance Corporation of the existence of a corporation known as the Modesto Motor Company, Inc., or advise the said plaintiff, General Motors Acceptance Corporation, of any distinction between the Modesto Motor Company, a co-partnership, and the Modesto Motor Company, a corporation.

"That by reason of the premises, the said plaintiff, General Motors Acceptance Corporation, purchased certain notes, conditional sales contracts and evidences of indebtedness from the Modesto Motor Company, Inc., a corporation, relying upon and believing that in truth and in fact it was the same firm or entity and described as Modesto Motor Company as set forth in the said contract of guaranty executed by the defendant herein.

"That the said defendant, C. W. Gandy, by reason of permitting the Modesto Motor Company to operate under the same identical name both as a co-partnership and a corporation and at the same place of business, and interchanging the assets of the said co-partnership to the corporation, caused the plaintiff, General Motors Acceptance Corporation, to rely and believe that the said Modesto Motor Company, either as a partnership or as a corporation, was the same entity as described as Modesto Motor Company in the contract of guaranty executed by the defendant herein.

"That by reason of the foregoing acts on the part of the said defendant, C. W. Gandy, the court further finds that the contract of guaranty was intended to, and did, guaranty all obligations of the Modesto Motor Company, either as a co-partnership or as a corporation, and that the defendant, C. W. Gandy, is, by reason of the premises, estopped to deny the obligations incurred under the said contract of guaranty by the Modesto Motor Company, a corporation.

"That the said contract of guaranty provided that the same should be in full force and effect until revoked in writing to the office of the said plaintiff, General Motors Acceptance Corporation, in the City of New York, State of New York.

"That the said contract of guaranty was not revoked within the terms and in accordance with the conditions of the said contract, but was in full force and effect at all times herein mentioned." Jan. 1927.] GENERAL MOTORS ACCEPT. CORP. v. GANDY. 293

"The theory upon which the plaintiff tried its case below and presents it on this appeal embrace several hypotheses, and may be stated as follows: 1. That the organization of the Modesto Motor Company, a corporation, was not effectuated for the purpose of dissolving or terminating the partnership, but that the corporation was formed by the parties constituting the partnership as a mere agency for the purpose of the more conveniently carrying on the partnership business, and that, therefore, the acts of the corporation within the scope of the partnership purposes and business were those of the partnership (see 6 Cal. Jur., sec. 201, p. 338, for a statement and an application of the rule by which the proposition stated is supported); 2. That defendant is estopped from denying his liability upon the contract of guaranty sued on for the reason that, assuming that said contract was in any way affected or impaired by reason of the formation of the corporation, his conduct and acts with reference to the organization of said corporation were such as to have had the effect of misleading plaintiff, or, rather, leading it to the belief that the Modesto Motor Company was, at all times during the subsistence of the contract of guaranty, a single entity, as to the legal form or status of which the plaintiff had no knowledge until the month of November, 1921, when, for the first time, plaintiff received information that a corporation under said name had been organized independently of the partnership existing and conducted under the same name; 3. That, assuming that the corporation was formed for the purpose only of acting as trustee or agent for the partnership in carrying on of the latter's business transactions, the defendant was bound and would remain bound to the terms of his guarantyship until he revoked the contract of guaranty in the mode prescribed thereby, to-wit: By serving upon the plaintiff, at its principal office at New York city, his withdrawal from said guaranty.

"The general contention of the defendant that the findings vital to the legal integrity of the judgment derive no support in the evidence necessarily involves an attack upon the position of the plaintiff, as above specifically pointed out, since, as will be noted, the theory of the findings is in accord with the theory upon which the plaintiff evidently presented its case below and presents it on this appeal. 294 GENERAL MOTORS ACCEPT. CORP. v. GANDY. [200 Cal.

"Although, as we have above pointed out, several different propositions are advanced here in support of the appeal, still the real problem the solution of which is decisive of the case is reducible to the simple question whether, as the court found, the defendant, upon the facts and circumstances characterizing the transactions culminating in this controversy, must be held to be estopped from claiming immunity from the obligations of the contract of guaranty pleaded in the complaint. In other words, the plaintiff's case, as we view the record, can only be sustained upon the theory that the circumstances attending the formation of the corporation—the part taken by defendant therein, his interest in both the corporation and the partnership, the fact that both the partnership and the corporation bore, substantially, the same name, and the asserted concealment from the plaintiff by him of the fact that the partnership and the corporation represented two separate and independent entities—were such as legally to foreclose in him the right to deny his liability upon the contract of guaranty, regardless of whether the promissory notes discounted and acquired by plaintiff were executed and delivered to the partnership or to the corporation. The plaintiff did not plead an estoppel. Its case, as made by its pleading, rests entirely upon the contract of guaranty. And thus it had the right to proceed. It was not required to anticipate any defense that might be pleaded or relied upon by the defendant. Under our system of pleading, unlike that of the common-law system, whereby, if necessary, a series of pleadings by the respective parties were required and could be resorted to in order to accomplish a joinder of issue upon any particular or other matter, the law answers for the plaintiff any special defense set up in the answer by the defendant. Therefore, the plaintiff here was entitled to introduce or rely upon the proof of any fact or facts which would impeach any special defense which the defendant by his answer has interposed, and this either by evidence directly contradicting the facts constituting such defense or by evidence of facts which, assuming the existence or truth of the facts upon which the special defense is predicated, will tend to avoid the legal effect thereof. Hence, the plaintiff here was at liberty to prove, if it could, an estoppel as against the defendant upon his plea that the contract Jan. 1927.] GENERAL MOTORS ACCEPT. CORP. v. GANDY. 295

of guaranty has no application to the contracts and the notes giving rise to the present litigation and that, consequently, as a guarantor on said guaranty, he was not legally 'responsible' for the defaults of the makers of said notes in the payment thereof. [1] The important question, then, is: Does the evidence warrant the finding that the defendant is estopped by reason of his conduct with respect to the several transactions involved herein from denying his liability upon the contract of guaranty? [2] (1) The existence of an estoppel is a question of fact, and the settled rule as to the proof of equitable estoppel is that the burden rests upon the party asserting such estoppel to prove all the elements constituting it 'by evidence having some reasonable tendency to establish the fact.' (10 Cal. Jur., p. 656, sec. 31; see, also, cases cited in the footnotes to said section.) The plaintiff, it appears clear to our minds, failed to sustain this burden. In the first place, it is to be noted that the evidence, without conflict, shows that the Modesto Motor Company, a partnership, and the Modesto Motor Company, a corporation, were two separate and independent entities, the partnership, from and after the formation of the corporation, being the agent for and dealing in certain kinds of automobiles, and the corporation the agent for and dealing in other kinds of automobiles. It is also undisputed and, indeed, indisputable, that the guaranty declared upon by plaintiff was executed and in operative effect some two months before the corporation was formed. In the second place, it is to be observed that, save and except the testimony of Wm. Robb, the assistant credit manager of plaintiff, and the only witness introduced by the latter, that he did not know, when the contracts and the notes directly concerned herein were taken over by the plaintiff, that the Modesto Motor Company was incorporated, the plaintiff made no affirmative showing in support of an estoppel, nor did it make any attempt to do so. Aside from said testimony of Robb, it relied entirely for the support of an estoppel upon facts brought out upon the examination of defendant under section 2055 of the Code of Civil Procedure and on his cross-examination, the fact that the partnership and the corporation bore the same name, and the asserted fact that it was not informed by defendant or any other person connected either with the corporation or the partnership or any other party to the contract of guaranty, prior 296 GENERAL MOTORS ACCEPT. CORP. v. GANDY. [200 Cal.

to its acquisition of the contracts and the notes involved herein, that the corporation had been formed and that the automobile agencies with which said contracts and notes were alone concerned had been transferred to said corporation. This, as stated, embraces the entire foundation for the claim and the support of the estoppel. The testimony of defendant on his examination by plaintiff under section 2055 of the Code of Civil Procedure was substantially the same as that given by him when he testified as his own witness or in his own behalf, both upon direct and cross-examination. Attention, however, may here be called to the testimony of the defendant that, within a brief time after the formation of the corporation and the transfer to the latter by the partnership of the agencies of the Oakland and Davis automobiles, and prior to the time at which, respectively, the contracts and the notes involved herein were acquired by plaintiff, he called at the offices of the plaintiff, and, in the presence of Knorr, informed its manager (a Mr. Warner, he believed to be the name of the manager) that the corporation had been formed, that the Oakland and Davis agencies had been transferred by the partnership to said corporation, and that he had severed his connection with the latter concern; that said manager stated to him (defendant) that the notice thus given was sufficient and that it was not necessary for him to transmit to and file with the main office of the plaintiff in New York city the written notice required by the contract of guaranty where the guarantors desire to withdraw therefrom as such guarantors. As before stated, this testimony of the defendant was not directly contradicted. Neither plaintiff's manager at San Francisco nor any other official of the plaintiff was called by the latter to give testimony in rebuttal of the defendant's testimony, if, indeed, any such adversary showing could have been made by the plaintiff. Nor was any explanation vouchsafed for the failure of plaintiff to call the said manager as a witness. But it may be conceded that the court as the trier of the issues of fact, in the exercise of a sound legal discretion, hedged by those tests which constitute the criterion by which the credibility of a witness may be determined and, therefore, the weight and the probative value of his testimony may be determined and appraised by the jury or the court by which the questions of fact are tried, was legally at liberty to disbelieve and Jan. 1927.] GENERAL MOTORS ACCEPT. CORP. v. GANDY. 297

so disregard the defendant's testimony. In support of the finding as to an estoppel, such would be the presumption. But, this being so, or at least assumed, it follows that there is no testimony remaining in the record as to the knowledge of the plaintiff of the fact of the formation of the Modesto Motor Company, a corporation, prior to the acceptance by the former of the contracts and the notes involved herein other than the documentary evidence consisting of the contracts themselves and the letters passing between plaintiff and the Modesto Motor Company, a corporation, after the latter was formed, and the testimony of Robb to the effect that he did not know of the existence of the Modesto Motor Company as a corporation. The letters from the plaintiff to the Modesto Motor Company, a corporation, after the acquisition by the former of the contracts and the notes themselves show beyond all question that plaintiff then had full knowledge of the fact that the Modesto Motor Company with which it was dealing as to said contracts and notes was a corporation. And, in this connection, it is important to note that there is absolutely no testimony in this record that the plaintiff did not know, at the time the contract of guaranty was executed and delivered to it, that the Modesto Motor Company with which it was then dealing was a partnership. But further consideration of the evidence need not be pursued, since the problem presently before us is not one whose solution is to be controlled so much by a consideration of the rule as to evidentiary conflicts as upon a consideration of the question whether the estoppel claimed is the necessary effect of the facts and circumstances from which it must have arisen, if at all. [3] Among the dominant essentials of equitable estoppel or estoppel *in pais* is that there must have been a false representation or a concealment of material facts of the matter as to which the estoppel is claimed, and the party to whom such representation is made or from whom such facts are concealed must have been ignorant, actual and permissibly, of the truth of the matter. [4] As a rule, manifestly, an equitable estoppel must be proved by oral testimony, hence the rule that certainty is essential to all estoppels is peculiarly applicable to estoppels *in pais*. The estoppel must be so established as to leave nothing to surmise or questionable inference. In other words, the repre- 298 GENERAL MOTORS ACCEPT. CORP. v. GANDY. [200 Cal.

sentation, whether express, or implied from the conduct of the party against whom the estoppel is sought to be invoked, must be such as to justify a prudent man in acting upon it, and must be plain and not doubtful. (Bigelow on Estoppel, 5th ed., pp. 570–578, incl.) Clearly, the estoppel claimed here does not measure up to the requirements of the above rules relating to the establishment of equitable estoppel. The testimony of Robb that he did not know at the time material here that the Modesto Motor Company, Incorporated, was in existence and the entity with which plaintiff was dealing with respect to the contracts and the notes in question is contradicted by the documentary evidence, and, indeed, by the plaintiff's own pleading. Assuming, though, that personally he had no knowledge of that fact, certainly it cannot be denied that he and other officers of the plaintiff were familiar with facts and circumstances sufficient to put them on notice as to the existence of two separate entities under the name of the Modesto Motor Company, and that the plaintiff in the transactions involved here was dealing with the corporation of that name.

"It is hardly necessary to suggest that the contract of guaranty had no relation to or connection with the Modesto Motor Company, Incorporated. That instrument applies solely to the partnership of that name, and, therefore, the requirement of said contract that a withdrawal therefrom by one or all of the guarantors could be effected only by a written notice filed in the New York office of plaintiff to that effect has no bearing upon any transactions had with the Modesto Motor Company, Incorporated."

[5] After the foregoing opinion was filed by the said district court of appeal respondent petitioned for a rehearing of said cause, which petition was by said court denied and an opinion filed in response to said petition, in which it was pointed out that the contracts purchased by the plaintiff from the Modesto Motor Company, Inc., which are the basis of defendant's alleged liability, showed upon their face that they were between purchasers of automobiles and Modesto Motor Company, Inc., and not the partnership of that name.

The only question raised by respondent's petition for a hearing by this court which has not been answered by the foregoing opinions of the district court of appeal is predi- Jan. 1927.] ESTATE OF JOHNSON. 299

cated upon the language of the guaranty, as follows: "The benefits and obligations hereof shall extend to and bind the heirs, administrators, successors and assigns of the respective parties hereto."

It is contended that under this provision the defendant was bound to guaranty the obligations of the corporation as the successor or assign of the partnership. The contention seems worthy of but brief consideration. First, according to the record, the corporation was not the successor or assign of the partnership. Both entities existed at the same time and conducted different business operations. Second, the parties to the contract of guaranty were the plaintiff and the defendant, and not the Modesto Motor Company. The record, therefore, presents no question involving the heirs, administrators, successors, or assigns of the respective parties to the contract of guaranty.

The judgment is reversed.

In the Matter of the Estate of AURILLA JOHNSON, Deceased. AMOS O. WILLIAMS et al., Appellants, v. AURILLA MABEL WALLER, Respondent.

[1] ESTATES OF DECEASED PERSONS — WILL CONTEST — HOLOGRAPHIC WILL—EXECUTION—TESTAMENTARY CAPACITY.—In a contest of an instrument, alleged to be the holographic will of a deceased person, based upon a claim that the instrument was not entirely dated, written, and signed by the hand of the decedent, and that the latter was not of sound mind at the time of its execution, where the evidence is conflicting upon the issues, a verdict in favor of the contestant will not be disturbed on appeal.

[2] ID.—LACK OF TESTAMENTARY CAPACITY—PRESUMPTIONS.—Where an old person was declared by a decree of the superior court incompetent to manage her property or to care for her person, and

1. See 26 Cal. Jur. 1101.
2. See 26 Cal. Jur. 635. 300 ESTATE OF JOHNSON. [200 Cal.

a guardian of her person and estate was appointed, and thereafter by decree of said court she was adjudged an insane person and committed to the state hospital, such facts, together with the testimony of a witness that her mental condition was absolutely the same during a period covering the dates of said adjudications, which included the date of execution of her alleged will, raised a presumption of lack of testamentary capacity in executing the will.

[3] Id.—EVIDENCE—CORROBORATION.—The fact that much of the testimony of the contestant in a will contest is uncorroborated does not for that reason remove it from the consideration of the jury.

[4] Id.—INSTRUCTIONS—CONSTRUCTION OF.—In such a case where the court gave an instruction that, "The jury has the proposed will before it as well as the exemplars of the handwriting of Aurilla Johnson, and it is for you to determine therefrom whether or not this document is wholly written, dated and signed in the handwriting of the decedent. You may determine this issue even contrary to the opinion of an expert, or without the evidence of a handwriting expert," the contention that the use of the word "therefrom" withdrew from the consideration of the jury oral testimony relating to the genuineness of the document in question, and limited the jury's consideration of the evidence to the proposed will and exemplars, cannot be maintained, where the court further instructed the jury that the instructions must be considered by it as a whole and that the proposed will might be considered together with all the evidence in the case.

[5] Id.—USURPATION OF FUNCTION OF JURY—EXPERT TESTIMONY.—The contention in such case that in said instruction the court usurped the function of the jury in stating that the issue might be determined "contrary to the opinion of an expert, or without the opinion of a handwriting expert," cannot be maintained, where no handwriting expert was called, as it may be assumed that the court meant testimony of such an expert was not necessary, which is a correct statement of the law.

[6] Id.—HANDWRITING—DETERMINATION OF—COMPARISON OF DOCUMENTS.—In such a case, an instruction that the jury could determine the issue with reference to the handwriting of the decedent by the comparison of the documents and without the aid of the oral testimony of any witness is a correct statement of the law.

[7] Id.—PROOF OF INCOMPETENCY—GUARDIANSHIP—TESTAMENTARY CAPACITY—BURDEN OF PROOF.—Proof of incompetency in a guardianship proceeding is evidence of mental condition on the date of the adjudication, but it is not prima facie evidence of testamentary incapacity so as to shift the burden of proof to the proponent of a will of the ward.

6. See 10 Cal. Jur. 860; 10 R. C. L. 993. Jan. 1927.] ESTATE OF JOHNSON. 301

[8] **Id.**—**ADOPTED CHILD—CONSIDERATION OF FACT—INSTRUCTIONS.—An adopted child is the lawful child of the decedent the same as though born in lawful wedlock, and in a contest by such child of the will of her adopted mother there is no error in instructing the jury that in considering the evidence it should bear in mind the legal effect of the adoption proceedings.

[9] **Id.**—**EVIDENCE—PHYSICIAN AND PATIENT—PRIVILEGED COMMUNICATIONS.—A conversation between a doctor, who is medical superintendent of a state hospital for the insane, and an inmate thereof, for the purpose of ascertaining particularly the mental condition of the patient, is privileged and inadmissible in evidence in a contest of the will of the patient.

[10] **Id.**—**IMPROPER QUESTION—LACK OF PREJUDICE.—In a will contest, where on cross-examination the contestant's counsel asked the sole beneficiary under the will the question, "Then you do not propose to be bound by the action of this jury in the event that they find that she was of unsound mind on April 3, 1923, do you?" to which objection was sustained, the failure to direct the jury to pay no heed to the question was not prejudicial error, where the court in other instructions specifically directed the jury to banish from their minds all questions propounded by counsel to which objections had been sustained.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Superior Court of Santa Clara County. John L. Hudner, Judge Presiding. Affirmed.

The facts are stated in the opinion of the court.

Maurice J. Rankin and L. H. Walker for Appellants.

H. A. Blanchard and Daniel Rygel for Respondent.

SHENK, J.—Aurilla Johnson died at the Agnews State Hospital for the Insane on January 11, 1924, at the age of

8. See 1 Cal. Jur. 442.
9. See 27 Cal. Jur. 58. 302 ESTATE OF JOHNSON. [200 Cal.
seventy-nine years. The public administrator of Santa Clara County offered for probate a document purporting to be her last will and testament, holographic in form. Emily W. Ewald, a niece of the deceased husband of the decedent, was named as the sole beneficiary. Aurilla Mabel Waller, an adopted daughter of the decedent and the respondent herein, was expressly omitted. The respondent contested the probate of the alleged will on the ground that the same was not entirely written, dated, and signed by the hand of the decedent and that decedent was not of sound mind on the day of its alleged execution. The case was tried before a jury which returned a verdict as to each issue in favor of the contestant. From the judgment on the verdict this appeal is prosecuted by the proponent and by the sole beneficiary named therein.

The grounds of appeal are that the evidence was insufficient to support the verdict on either of said issues and that the court erred in giving certain instructions and in admitting and excluding certain testimony.

[1] On the issue of whether the alleged will was wholly written, dated, and signed by the decedent evidence was introduced on behalf of the appellants to the effect that the said document was entirely written, dated, and signed by her. On the other hand, the contestant testified that while the signature attached to the document was genuine the remainder of the document was not in her mother's handwriting. If the latter testimony was believed by the jury to be true, and we must on appeal assume that it was, the said evidence was sufficient to support the verdict on that issue. As to the issue of testamentary incapacity the same situation is disclosed by the record, namely, a conflict in the evidence. [2] On behalf of the contestant it appeared that on the twenty-second day of March, 1922, the decedent was, in proceedings instituted in the superior court of Santa Clara County, declared to be incompetent to manage her property or to care for her person and a guardian of her person and estate was appointed. She was continuously thereafter subjected to such guardianship by judgments of said court. On the tenth day of May, 1923, she was by said court adjudged an insane person and committed to the Agnews State Hospital, where she remained until her death. The alleged will was dated April 3, 1923. No one claims to Jan. 1927.] ESTATE OF JOHNSON. 303

have witnessed its execution. The appellant, Mrs. Ewald, testified that it was delivered to her by the decedent personally a few days after its date. One of the physicians at the state hospital testified that the decedent was suffering from senile dementia to such an extent that she could not discern the difference between day and night. The adjudication, on May 10, 1923, that the decedent was insane raised a presumption that she was wanting in testamentary capacity on that date (Estate of Baker, 176 Cal. 430 [168 Pac. 881]). The judgments in the incompetency proceedings were evidence of the mental condition of the decedent on the days of those adjudications. Assuming, as contended by appellants, that neither the judgments in the incompetency proceedings nor the adjudication of insanity on May 10, 1923, would be sufficient to show want of testamentary capacity on April 3, 1923, the date of the alleged will, nevertheless the appellant, Mrs. Ewald, testified that the mental condition of the decedent was absolutely the same from October, 1922, to December, 1923, which dates would include May 10, 1923, when she was presumed to be lacking in testamentary capacity, and April 3, 1923, the date of the alleged will (see Estate of Loveland, 162 Cal. 595 [123 Pac. 801]).

In addition to the record evidence and the testimony of Mrs. Ewald there was other oral testimony on the issue of want of testamentary capacity, both in support of and against that issue. The contestant testified at length as to the mental condition of the decedent for several years prior to her death, including the period subsequent to October, 1922. From this testimony, coupled with the testimony of Mrs. Ewald that the mental condition of the decedent was absolutely the same from October, 1922, to December, 1923, the jury was entitled to infer that on the date of the alleged will the decedent did not possess testamentary capacity.

[3] The appellants urge that much of the testimony of the contestant was uncorroborated, but even so, the same was not for that reason removed from the consideration of the jury (sec. 1844, Code Civ. Proc.). The record, therefore, presents a conflict in the evidence as to both issues which, when resolved in favor of the contestant by the jury, may not otherwise be resolved on appeal.

[4] The appellants contend that the court committed prejudicial error in giving the following instructions: "The 304 ESTATE OF JOHNSON. [200 Cal.
jury has the proposed will before it as well as the exemplars of the handwriting of Aurilla Johnson, and it is for you to determine therefrom whether or not this document is wholly written, dated and signed in the handwriting of the decedent. You may determine this issue even contrary to the opinion of an expert, or without the evidence of a handwriting expert." It is insisted that by the use of the word "therefrom" in the foregoing instruction the court withdrew from the consideration of the jury the oral testimony relating to the genuineness of the document in question and limited its consideration of the evidence to the proposed will and the exemplars. In the absence of other instructions given the point urged might present a serious situation, but the court went on to instruct the jury that the instructions must be considered by the jury as a whole and that the proposed will might be considered together with all the evidence in the case. When considered in their entirety it may not be said that the appellants were prejudicially affected by the use of the word complained of. [5] It is also insisted that in said instruction the court usurped the function of the jury in stating that the issue might be determined "contrary to the opinion of an expert, or without the opinion of a handwriting expert." No witness was called who assumed to be a handwriting expert in the sense of a professional examiner of questioned documents. It may fairly be assumed that the court meant, and that the jury understood, that the testimony of such an expert was not necessary to a determination of the issue. It is then a correct statement of the law. [6] If in the first use of the word "expert" the court referred to those witnesses who were familiar with the handwriting of the decedent it is also a correct statement of the law that the jury could determine the issue by comparison of the documents and without the aid of the oral testimony of any witness (Castor v. Bernstein, 2 Cal. App. 703 [84 Pac. 244]).

The court instructed the jury that the adjudications of March 22, 1922, and January 31, 1923, declaring the decedent to be an incompetent person in the guardianship proceedings were "prima facie evidence of want of testamentary capacity" on the dates of said orders. It is urged that such was not the legal effect of such orders. We are cited to no authority in this state and we have discovered Jan. 1927.] ESTATE OF JOHNSON. 305

none since the amendment of section 40 of the Civil Code in 1878, holding that an adjudication of incompetency in a guardianship proceeding raises a presumption of testamentary incapacity or is even *prima facie* evidence of testamentary incapacity. *Estate of Johnson*, 57 Cal. 529, construed said section 40 prior to its amendment. [7] Proof of incompetency in a guardianship proceeding is evidence of mental condition on the date of the adjudication but it is not *prima facie* evidence of testamentary incapacity so as to shift the burden of proof to the proponent of the will (*Estate of Loveland*, *supra*; *Rice v. Rice*, 50 Mich. 448 [15 N. W. 545]). Notwithstanding the erroneous use of the term "*prima facie*" in the instruction complained of, we are of the opinion that the appellants were not prejudiced thereby in view of the fact that the court elsewhere fully instructed the jury that said adjudications of incompetency in the guardianship proceedings did not necessarily mean that the decedent was of unsound mind at the time of such adjudications or that she was not then competent to make a valid will; also that the adjudication of insanity of May 10, 1923, did not raise a presumption of testamentary incapacity on April 3, 1923, the date of the alleged will, and that the burden of proving that the decedent was of unsound mind at the time of the execution of the alleged will rested at all times upon the contestant. When considered as a whole we think the jury was made clearly to understand that notwithstanding the several adjudications the burden of proving unsoundness of mind on the date of the alleged will was always on the contestant.

[8] Complaint is made of the instruction that "in weighing the evidence you must treat the contestant in this case in all respects as though she was born to Aurilla Johnson in lawful wedlock." It is insisted that the jury had the right to take into consideration the fact that the contestant was not a blood relative of the decedent but a relative only by adoption, and that the giving of said instruction was in violence of our constitutional provision forbidding a judge to charge the jury with respect to matters of fact. It was conceded at the trial that the contestant was the adopted child of the decedent. As such she was the lawful child of the decedent the same as though she had been born to the decedent in lawful wedlock (sec. 228, Civ. Code; 1 Cal.

200 Cal.—20 306 ESTATE OF JOHNSON. [200 Cal.
Jur. 449). The instruction correctly declared the law and we find no error in the declaration by the court that in considering the evidence the jury should bear in mind the legal effect of the adoption proceeding.

[9] Complaint is also made of the ruling of the court in sustaining an objection to a question propounded to Doctor Stocking, wherein the witness was requested to relate a conversation he had with the decedent at the hospital. Doctor Stocking, as a physician and medical superintendent of the Agnews State Hospital, was interviewing the decedent as one of his patients in the hospital for the purpose of ascertaining particularly her mental condition. It does not appear that any third party heard the conversation and the objection was sustained on the ground that the said conversation was privileged. The witness was permitted to give his opinion as to the mental condition of the decedent at the time of the conversation and we find no prejudicial error in excluding evidence of the conversation itself.

[10] During the cross-examination of Mrs. Ewald, the contestant's counsel asked her the following question: "Then you do not propose to be bound by the action of this jury in the event that they find that she was of unsound mind on April 3, 1923, do you?" This question was objected to by appellants' counsel and the court was requested to instruct the jury to disregard the same. The court sustained the objection but did not at that time direct the jury to pay no heed to the question. The point is made that the refusal then to instruct the jury is prejudicial error. There is no merit in the contention, for the reason that in its instructions to the jury the court specifically directed the jury to banish from their minds all questions propounded by counsel to which objections had been sustained. This, we think, was all that was required under the record here presented.

The judgment is affirmed. As the appeal herein appears to have been prosecuted in good faith, it is ordered that the costs of the appellants be paid out of the assets of said estate (sec. 1720, Code Civ. Proc).

SHENK, J.—[1] On a contest before probate of the alleged will of the decedent the jury found for the contestant and judgment was entered accordingly, including costs to the contestant. On motion of the proponent the trial court entered an order vacating the judgment for costs. The con-

1. See 26 Cal. Jur. 1113. 308 ESTATE OF JOHNSON. [200 Cal.
testant appealed from said order and the order was affirmed (*Estate of Johnson*, 198 Cal. 469 [245 Pac. 1089]). On the going down of the *remittitur* the clerk of this court inserted therein the words "Respondents to recover costs on appeal," in accordance with the rule governing ordinary civil actions. In due time the contestant filed a notice of motion in this court to recall the *remittitur* and to strike therefrom the provision for costs on appeal on the ground that the allowance of costs in a contest before probate must abide the final determination of the proceeding (sec. 1720, Code Civ. Proc.; *Estate of Johnson*, supra). The proceeding is finally determined by the affirmance of the judgment on the main appeal this day decided (*Estate of Johnson*, ante, p. 299 [252 Pac. 1049]), wherein this court has in the exercise of its discretion under said section 1720 directed that costs on the main appeal be paid out of the assets of the estate. On the former appeal the court did not exercise its discretion in awarding costs pursuant to said section 1720, and the provision for costs on said appeal was improperly incorporated in the *remittitur*. This motion is the proper remedy on behalf of the contestant to exclude from the *remittitur* the unauthorized provision (*San Joaquin etc. Irr. Co. v. Stevinson*, 165 Cal. 540 [132 Pac. 1021]). [2] As this court has lost jurisdiction of the former appeal, we may not now exercise any discretionary power in awarding costs therein. An appropriate order may, however, be made by the trial court with reference to the costs on the former appeal in the exercise of its discretion under said section 1720.

The motion is therefore granted, and it is ordered that the *remittitur* issued herein by the clerk of this court on May 20, 1926, be recalled and that a correct *remittitur* be issued in its place *nunc pro tunc* omitting the words "Respondents to recover costs on appeal."

THE COURT.—This appeal was placed upon a special calendar of this court upon an order to the respondents to show cause why the judgment herein should not be reversed, or that such order be made as might be meet in the premises. At the time of the placing of said cause upon said calendar, and the entry of said order, it appeared that the appellant's brief had been filed herein, but that no brief on behalf of the respondents had been filed, although the time for the filing of such brief under the rules of this court had long since expired. In response to said order the respondents appeared with a notice of motion for an order affirming the judgment, notice of which motion was duly served upon the appellant herein more than ten days prior to the hearing thereon. Upon the call of such calendar and the hearing upon said motion the appellant failed to appear or to respond thereto. The respondents, however, appeared to urge that their said motion should be granted. The matter was submitted to the court for decision in accordance with the terms of its order to show cause. [1] An 310 ESTATE OF LEE. [200 Cal.

Charles N. Douglas for Appellant.

W. W. Watson, Clarence W. Morris, Joseph T. Curley and Charles S. Peery for Respondents.

SHENK, J.—Robert S. Lee died on the twentieth day of September, 1922, in the city and county of San Francisco, leaving an estate therein consisting of real and personal property of the appraised value of $17,784.35. On the next day his will, bearing date December 31, 1918, was filed with the clerk of the superior court in and for said city and county. After proceedings duly taken the will was proved and admitted to probate. Bequests of $100 each were left to some fifteen different institutions and individuals, including Kitty Tooty Johnson, who was also made residuary devisee and legatee. None of the persons named in the will was related to the decedent. The first and final account of the executor was settled and allowed and the court postponed distribution of the estate until it was determined to whom distribution should be made pursuant to the issue of heirship tendered by the petition of Josephine Marie Lee Wrynn, who claimed to be the daughter of the decedent and a pretermitted heir and who prayed that the entire estate 312 ESTATE OF LEE. [200 Cal.
be distributed to her. Upon the trial of the issue the court found that the petitioner was not the child or any heir at law of the decedent and, therefore, not entitled to any portion of said estate. From a judgment entered accordingly Mrs. Wrynn prosecutes this appeal.

The court found that Robert S. Lee, the decedent, and Marie Dierse engaged in a marriage ceremony on the sixteenth day of May, 1895, in the city and county of San Francisco; that they lived together until they separated about three years thereafter, and that the decedent commenced an action for and was, on March 26, 1903, granted a divorce from Marie Dierse Lee in the superior court of the city and county of San Francisco. The appellant was born on July 5, 1895, and it is undisputed that she was the daughter of Marie Dierse Lee, the same person who engaged in the marriage ceremony with the decedent and who was divorced by the decedent about eight years thereafter. It also appears as an undisputed fact that the appellant was not named in said will.

The appellant bases her claim to heirship first upon the presumption of legitimacy declared by section 193 of the Civil Code that "all children born in wedlock are presumed to be legitimate." She then contends that under section 195 of the Civil Code "the presumption of legitimacy can be disputed only by the husband or wife, or the descendant of one or both of them," and that none of the parties to the present proceedings belongs to any of the classes of persons entitled to dispute her legitimacy.

Over the objection of the appellant evidence was introduced by the respondents to prove, and the court found, that the decedent was a mulatto; that the mother of the appellant is a white woman; that the mother was pregnant about seven months before she knew or became acquainted with the decedent and that a white man was the father of the appellant. From the facts so found the trial court concluded that the deceased and Marie Dierse were never legally married; that the claimant was not the child of the decedent and, therefore, not a pretermitted or any heir of the decedent. It is insisted by the respondents, first, that the said marriage was void under section 60 of the Civil Code, which provides that "all marriages of white persons with negroes, Jan. 1927.] 	ESTATE OF LEE.		313

Mongolians, or mulattoes are illegal and void," and, secondly, that since it appears that the decedent was not the father of the appellant, the latter was not the "issue" of said void marriage so as to entitle her to the benefit of section 1387 of the Civil Code, which provides that "the issue of all marriages null in law . . . are legitimate."

It is argued by the appellant that evidence to the effect that said marriage was illegal and that her natural father was a white man was inadmissible to establish her alleged illegitimacy under the facts here presented. The determination of this question depends upon the effect to be given the decree of divorce granted March 26, 1903. It is the contention of the appellant that the effect of that decree was judicially to establish the relationship or status matrimonially of the parties to said action and that such determination was and is conclusive under the provisions of section 1908 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which provides: "The effect of a judgment . . . before a court of this state . . . having jurisdiction to pronounce the judgment . . . is as follows: 1. In case of a judgment . . . in respect to the personal, . . . or legal condition or relation of a particular person, the judgment . . . is conclusive upon . . . the condition or relation of the person." The respondents dismiss the point with the statement that it is unworthy of consideration. We are satisfied that the contention may not be so or at all dismissed. The judgment of divorce was not impeached nor was it sought to be impeached by the respondents on any legal ground (sec. 1916, Code Civ. Proc.). In the absence of such impeachment it must be assumed that the court had jurisdiction over the cause and over the parties (sec. 1917, Code Civ. Proc.). It must further be assumed that the court found in that action, among other things, that the ceremony in which the plaintiff and defendant participated resulted in their marriage; that they were married persons when the cause was tried; that sufficient grounds for divorce were alleged and proved and that the plaintiff, the decedent herein, was entitled to a judgment dissolving the bonds of matrimony theretofore and since the sixteenth day of May, 1895, existing between the parties. 314 ESTATE OF LEE. [200 Cal.
[1] A divorce proceeding in so far as it relates to the marriage relation of the parties to the action and the termination of the marriage status is a proceeding *in rem* (*In re Newman*, 75 Cal. 213 [7 Am. St. Rep. 146, 16 Pac. 887]). Such an action is brought for the purpose of establishing judicially the matrimonial status of the parties and, if it be found that a matrimonial relation exists, then for the purpose of a dissolution of that relation (*Gridley v. Boggs*, 62 Cal. 190, 202; *De la Montanya v. De la Montanya*, 112 Cal. 101 [53 Am. St. Rep. 165, 32 L. R. A. 82, 44 Pac. 345]). [2] As a judgment *in rem* it is binding upon all the world as to the determination of the marital status of the parties and is immune from collateral attack (*People v. Perris Irr. Dist.*, 132 Cal. 289 [64 Pac. 399, 773]; 15 Cal. Jur. 239), except on grounds specified by the code (sec. 1916, Code Civ. Proc.), none of which is urged here. [3] The judgment here under consideration was a conclusive determination of the status of the parties to said action as husband and wife from May 16, 1895, to the dissolution of that relation by the judgment of divorce on March 26, 1903. Said judgment was and is binding upon the parties to the present proceeding and constitutes a judicial determination of a state of "wedlock" existing between the parties to said action when the appellant was born on July 5, 1895. Since the appellant must, therefore, be held to have been born in wedlock she was and is entitled to the presumption of legitimacy declared by section 193 of the Civil Code, and since none of the respondents nor any person named in said will is included within the class enumerated in section 195 of the Civil Code as entitled to dispute the legitimacy of the appellant, all question as to her alleged illegitimacy is here foreclosed (*In re Madalina*, 174 Cal. 693 [1 A. L. R. 1629, 164 Pac. 348]).

The respondents rely on *Estate of Gregorson*, 160 Cal. 21 [Ann. Cas. 1912D, 1124, L. R.

statement was necessary to the decision and that it correctly declared the general rule, the question of a prior judgment of divorce as affecting the marital status was neither involved nor considered in that case and cannot be deemed determinative under the facts here presented. Other authorities cited and relied upon by the respondents are likewise not in point in the state of the record.

[4] As the evidence relating to the alleged illegitimacy of the appellant was inadmissible and the finding and conclusion of the court that she was not an heir of the decedent were predicated thereon, it follows that said finding and conclusion were not supported by any competent evidence in the case. Under the evidence material to the controversy the appellant was entitled to a judgment declaring that she was and is the sole heir of the decedent and as such entitled to the distribution of said estate.

Sufficient findings were made by the court, based upon competent evidence, and there is none to the contrary, to entitle the appellant to a decree of distribution. After entry of judgment in the trial court appellant made a motion to set aside the judgment and to enter a new and different judgment on the same findings. This motion was denied. We think the motion should have been granted.

It is ordered that the judgment be and the same is hereby reversed and the cause is remanded, with directions to enter a judgment on the findings declaring the appellant to be the sole heir of the decedent and distributing to her the property constituting said estate.

APPLICATION for a Writ of Supersedeas to stay proceedings pending appeal from an order of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County quashing a Writ of Execution. Albert Lee Stephens, Judge. Writ denied.

The facts are stated in the opinion of the court.

William A. Alderson for Respondents.

THE COURT.—Application for a writ of supersedeas. The applicant herein instituted an action against the above-named respondents on July 19, 1915, in the superior court of the county of Los Angeles. Judgment was entered in said action in favor of the applicant on January 28, 1916. On May 10, 1916, execution issued upon said judgment and was thereafter returned partly satisfied. No further proceedings were had or taken in the action until September 3, 1926, at which time, on an ex parte motion of counsel for the applicant and apparently without prior notice thereof

1. See 23 Cal. Jur. 985.
2. See 11 Cal. Jur. 61. Jan. 1927.] HULSE v. DAVIS. 317

having been given to the respondents, an order was made by the court below for the issuance of a second execution upon the judgment theretofore entered. Pursuant thereto a writ of execution was duly issued and levied. Thereafter, and on September 23, 1926, a temporary restraining order was entered by said court, on motion of the respondents, enjoining any further action or proceedings under and by virtue of said writ of execution. On October 5, 1926, the lower court made and entered an order vacating the prior order for the issuance of a writ of execution, recalling and quashing the writ issued pursuant thereto and denying further process of said court for the enforcement of the judgment. In accordance with this latter order the sheriff on October 9, 1926, released and discharged the property of respondents theretofore held in custodia legis. The applicant has appealed from the order quashing the writ of execution and pending the determination of said appeal a writ of supersedeas is sought "staying all proceedings in the above-entitled matter" and directing "that if the said sheriff has released from levy the property of the defendant . . . to re-levy thereon and keep the same intact until the determination of this appeal."

The respondents oppose the application on the ground that this is not a proper case for the issuance of a writ of supersedeas.

[1] This court in the case of *Imperial Water Co., v. Hall*, 199 Cal. 556 [250 Pac. 394], recently had occasion to consider the nature, scope, and purpose of a supersedeas. A reading of the opinion in that case and the authorities cited and quoted from therein reveals that a writ of supersedeas may be granted in a proper case only to restrain and prevent the enforcement of a judgment or order by the court below or its officers pending an appeal therefrom. If the judgment or order appealed from is self-executing and "no process is required to be issued for its enforcement no supersedeas is allowed." (*Tyler v. Presley*, 72 Cal. 290 [12 Pac. 289, 13 Pac. 169]; *Dulin v. Pacific Wood & Coal Co.*, 98 Cal. 304 [33 Pac. 123]; *Imperial Water Co. v. Hall*, supra.)

In the instant case the order appealed from is complete and final in itself and no process of the court below is required to be issued for its enforcement, for it is settled that 318 CRAWFORD v. IMPERIAL IRRIGATION DIST. [200 Cal.

"when an execution is quashed, any levy made pursuant thereto falls with it, and any title to the property vested in the sheriff by the levy is defeated." (Wellington v. Sedgwick, 12 Cal. 469, 475; Buffandeau v. Edmondson, 17 Cal. 436, 442 [79 Am. Dec. 139]; see, also, 11 Cal. Jur. 61, sec. 18.) If the sheriff, in violation of the court order, continues in possession of the property he does so unlawfully and without right, in the absence of some other process in his hands which would justify his action.

[2] It is apparent, therefore, that an order quashing execution has an intrinsic effect and is self-executing. Process is not required for the enforcement of such an order and pending the determination of an appeal therefrom a writ of supersedeas may not properly be issued.

For the foregoing reasons the application for a writ of supersedeas is denied and the temporary stay heretofore granted by this court is hereby terminated and ended.

D. R. CRAWFORD, Respondent, v. IMPERIAL IRRIGATION DISTRICT et al., Appellants.

[1] CONTRACTS—INFLUENCING LEGISLATION—VALIDITY OF CONTRACT.—The employment of persons to influence legislation or to influence decisions of the Land Department, or even the decisions of judicial tribunals, in a proper way, is not against sound public policy, and a contract having such purpose is valid.

[2] ID.—IRRIGATION DISTRICT—RESOLUTION EMPLOYING PERSON TO INFLUENCE LEGISLATION—PROPER PURPOSES—PRESUMPTIONS.—Where a resolution of an irrigation district employing a person to secure the passage of legislation desired by the district plainly limits the services of the employee to appearing on behalf of the district before the various committees of Congress having under consideration a certain bill and presenting facts and arguments in support of said bill, the services are not against public policy or good morals and are legal.

1. See 2 Cal. Jur. 126; 6 R. C. L. 734. Jan. 1927.] CRAWFORD v. IMPERIAL IRRIGATION DIST. 319

[3] Id.—IMPERIAL IRRIGATION DISTRICT—AUTHORITY TO EMPLOY AGENT. The Imperial Irrigation District had authority, under its general powers, to employ an agent to appear before the appropriate committees of Congress to present facts and arguments in support of the Swing-Johnson Bill, which bill has for its purpose the enabling of the federal government to enter into a contract with the district which is the only means whereby said district can hope to obtain a supply of water for irrigation and domestic purposes and to secure protection from destruction of the lands therein by the flood waters of the Colorado River.

[4] IRRIGATION DISTRICTS—NATURE OF—MUNICIPAL CORPORATIONS.—An irrigation district is not strictly a municipal corporation but a public corporation for municipal purposes.

[5] Id.—POWERS OF IRRIGATION DISTRICTS.—An irrigation district, like any other public or private corporation, derives its powers from the statute under which it is created and from such other statutes as may have been enacted by the legislature granting it additional powers or limiting those already granted; and these powers are as different from those exercised by a strictly municipal corporation as the purposes of an irrigation district differ from those of a city or county or other strictly municipal corporation.

[6] PUBLIC OFFICERS—POWERS OF.—A public officer or board has not only the powers expressly enumerated by law, but also those implied powers which are necessary to the exercise of the powers expressly granted.

[7] APPEAL—AGREED STATEMENT OF FACTS—QUESTION OF LAW.—Where a case is submitted upon an agreed statement of facts without any other evidence whatever, findings of fact are unnecessary, and the only question before the court is as to what the law is applicable to those facts, and any findings of fact made by the court under these circumstances may be disregarded.

C. L. Brown and Harry W. Horton for Respondent.

CURTIS, J.—The Imperial Irrigation District, one of the defendants herein, is an irrigation district organized and existing under and by virtue of the California Irrigation District Act, approved March 31, 1897 (Stats. 1897, p. 254), and the acts amendatory thereof and supplementary thereto. The plaintiff is an elector and taxpayer of said district and the defendants, Mark Rose, Earl C. Pound, Ira Aten, C. W. Brockman, and W. O. Blair, constitute the board of directors of said district, and the defendant, F. H. McIver, is the duly appointed, qualified, and acting treasurer of said district. On October 23, 1925, at a regular meeting of said board of directors, the following resolution was adopted by said board: "Resolved that Imperial Irrigation District employ B. F. Fly at a salary of $250.00 per month and one-half of his actual and necessary expenses to appear on behalf of this district before the various committees of Congress of the United States having under consideration the Swing-Johnson bill, to present facts and arguments in support of said bill, said employment to commence on the 1st day of December, 1925." Thereafter the said B. F. Fly, referred to in said resolution, accepted said employment and agreed to perform the services required of him by said resolution in consideration of the payment to him of the salary and expenses provided for therein.

This action was instituted by plaintiff as an elector and taxpayer of said district to enjoin the defendant from auditing, allowing, or ordering paid any claim or demand for salary or expenses of the said B. F. Fly for services rendered pursuant to the terms of said resolution. The trial court held that said employment was illegal and gave judgment in favor of plaintiff in accordance with the prayer of his complaint. From the judgment in favor of plain- Jan. 1927.] CRAWFORD v. IMPERIAL IRRIGATION DIST. 321

tiff the defendants, other than defendant C. W. Brockman, have appealed. The contention of plaintiff, the respondent herein, is that the contract of employment of the said B. F. Fly by the Imperial Irrigation District is illegal and void for two reasons. First, it is a contract to influence legislation, and it is against public policy and for that reason void; and, secondly, the defendant, the Imperial Irrigation District, is without any authority to expend the funds of said district for the purposes designated in said resolution, even if the contract were not void as being against public policy.

Considering the first point made by the respondent against the validity of the contract employing Mr. Fly, it is evident from the terms of the resolution that the purpose of employing him was to secure favorable action on the part of the Congress of the United States in behalf of the Swing-Johnson Bill mentioned in said resolution and then pending before Congress. Appellants make no claim that this was not the object and purpose of the district in the employment of Mr. Fly. They do contend, however, that notwithstanding that this was the object and purpose of said contract, yet, as by the terms of the resolution, he is simply to appear before the committees of Congress having said bill under consideration and to present to said committees facts and arguments in support of said bill, such employment is perfectly proper, and is not against good morals or contrary to public policy. A contract somewhat similar to the one here involved was before the supreme court in the case of *Foltz v. Cogswell*, 86 Cal. 542 [25 Pac. 60]. In that action the plaintiff sought to recover for services rendered by her in the preparation of a certain bill to be presented to the legislature of the state of California "and in making arguments before the various committees of that body, in order that the justice and merits of defendant's demand for the passage of the bill might be fully understood." This court, after quoting from the case of *Miles v. Thorne*, 38 Cal. 335 [99 Am. Dec. 384], used the following language: "In the latter case, the court draws a distinction between the use of personal, or any secret or sinister, influence upon legislators, by one who seeks the passage of an act which it holds to be contrary to public policy, and the open advocacy of the same before the legislature or any committee thereof

200 Cal.—21 322 CRAWFORD v. IMPERIAL IRRIGATION DIST. [200 Cal.

in open session." This court held in the case of *Foltz v. Cogswell, supra*, that plaintiff was entitled to recover for the services performed in drawing said bill and advocating its passage before the various committees of the state legislature. In the case of *Bergen v. Frisbie*, 125 Cal. 168 [57 Pac. 784], the defendant, being the owner of timber land entries, employed the plaintiff as an attorney to influence the official action of the Secretary of the Interior favorably to the issuance of patents upon such entries without any stipulation for the use of improper means or methods. This court held: "We have carefully scanned the face of this contract, and find nothing whatever there to justify a judicial declaration that it is against good morals. There was no secrecy, no deception, no fraud, no corruption. . . . The means and manner to be employed are the all-important factors in marking the validity or invalidity of the contract. We see no one of its provisions that stamp it void as against public policy and good morals. Neither do we find anything in the evidence indicating any act done by the plaintiffs that to any degree could be construed improper. [1] The employment of persons to influence legislation, or to influence decisions of the land department, or even the decisions of judicial tribunals, in a proper way, is not against sound public policy. . . . The means and methods to be used must be improper, or else such employment is perfectly legitimate in the eyes of the law." The case of *Schweppe v. Sandberg*, 50 Cal. App. 507 [195 Pac. 454], involved the legality of a contract entered into by the defendant employing the plaintiff to present certain arguments before the State Highway Commission for the purpose of inducing the commission to so locate a proposed highway so as to pass through the defendant's lands. In holding that the contract was not illegal or against public policy or good morals the district court of appeal expressed itself as follows: "That the owner of property lying within a region through which it is proposed to construct a public highway, the precise route of which has not yet been determined upon by the public officials who are charged with the duty of selecting the same, may not honestly and in good faith present before such officials facts and arguments with relation to the merits of a particular route which, if selected, will run to or through his property, no one will for a moment Jan. 1927.] CRAWFORD v. IMPERIAL IRRIGATION DIST. 323

question, and it follows necessarily that what such property owner may in good faith do in person in that regard he may do through another, and he may for that purpose select an attorney or agent to act as his representative in presenting the merits of the particular location of said highway which he desires to have selected, and, hence, of course, he may agree to pay his attorney, agent, or representative a stipulated reward for the performance of such services. There is nothing illegal or immoral or against public policy in such a transaction or service."

The only California case relied upon by respondent as laying down a different doctrine than that enunciated in the foregoing authorities is the case of *County of Colusa v. Welch*, 122 Cal. 428 [55 Pac. 243]. This case was one brought through the district attorney of Colusa county to restrain the county treasurer of said county from paying the sum of $1,000 upon a warrant issued by the county auditor in favor of one B. S. Sprague. The county of Colusa was interested in the defeat of a certain bill pending before the state legislature, and so it was alleged in the complaint in said action, "That if the sum of one thousand dollars was agreed to be paid to said Sprague, it was to secure, by means of personal solicitation, and by means of private interview with members of the legislature of California, and by means of lobbying, the defeat of said senate bill." A general demurrer to the complaint was sustained by the trial court. The supreme court reversed the judgment and held that the complaint stated a good cause of action. The decision of the court upon this phase of the case was predicated upon those allegations of the complaint wherein it was alleged that Sprague was employed to secure the defeat of the bill by means of lobbying as well as by other means. Lobbying has a definite meaning in this state and it is made a crime both by the constitution and statutes of this state (art. IV, sec. 35; Pen. Code, sec. 89). The court in this case cites with approval the following statement from Cooley on Constitutional Limitations: "The law also seeks to cast its protection around legislative sessions, and to shield them against corrupt and improper influences, by making void all contracts which have for their object to influence legislation in any other manner than by such open and public presentation of facts, arguments, and appeals to reason as are recog- 324 CRAWFORD v. IMPERIAL IRRIGATION DIST. [200 Cal.

nized as proper and legitimate with all public bodies. While counsel may be properly employed to present the reasons in favor of any public measure to the body authorized to pass upon it, or to any of its committees empowered to collect facts and hear arguments, and parties interested may lawfully contract to pay for this service, yet to secretly approach the members of such a body with a view to influence their action at a time and in a manner that do not allow the presentation of opposite views, is improper and unfair to the opposing interest; and a contract to pay for this irregular and improper service would not be enforced by the law." We are, therefore, unable to find anything in the case of County of Colusa v. Welch, supra, opposed to the rule laid down in the other California cases cited above. They hold, and it must be accepted as the law in this state, as summarized in 6 Corpus Juris, page 126: "The employment of persons to influence legislation, or to influence decisions of the land department, or even the decisions of judicial tribunals, in a proper way, is not against sound public policy. A distinction is drawn between the use of personal, or any secret or sinister, influence upon legislators, by one who seeks the passage of an act, which is contrary to public policy, and the open advocacy of the same. It is generally agreed that the appearance of a representative of an interested party before a public body to urge the adoption of a particular measure or policy is neither illegal nor improper when the means employed are open and have for their purpose the presentation of the merits of the advocated matter."

[2] Turning now to the resolution of the Irrigation District employing Mr. Fly, we find nothing therein which in any way contemplates the use by Mr. Fly of any improper or illegal means to secure the passage of the legislation desired by the district. The resolution plainly states that Mr. Fly is employed to appear on behalf of the district before the various committees of Congress of the United States having under consideration the Swing-Johnson Bill and to present facts and arguments in support of said bill. His services are limited by the terms of the resolution to appearances before the various congressional committees having the bill under consideration and to the presentation before said committees of facts and arguments in support of said bill. "It is the universal presumption of law that where a con- Jan. 1927.] CRAWFORD v. IMPERIAL IRRIGATION DIST. 325

tract can be performed legally, it will not be presumed that the parties intended to perform it in an illegal manner." (Fites v. March, 171 Cal. 487 [153 Pac. 926].) The very nature of the services to be performed under the resolution renders it practically impossible to perform them in any other way than in open advocacy of the bill, as the facts and arguments in support of the bill are to be presented before various congressional committees. These hearings as a rule, as we understand the procedure before them, are generally held in open and public sessions of the committees where not only the members of the committee and the parties interested in the pending matters but the public itself are free to attend. Services of this nature, as we have already seen, have been held in this state, without exception, to be not against public policy or good morals, but lawful and legal. The contention, therefore, that the contract of the district employing Mr. Fly to represent said district before the various congressional committees having in charge the Swing-Johnson Bill was void as being against public policy and good morals cannot be sustained.

[3] The other question presented upon this appeal involves the power and authority of the Imperial Irrigation District to enter into the contract employing Mr. Fly and to pay for his services from the funds of such district, even if such contract is not against public policy. The position taken by respondent is that as the purpose of such contract is to employ Mr. Fly to influence legislation, the district has no power to use the funds of said district for such purpose. [4] Respondent contends that an irrigation district is a municipal corporation and that the rule is well established that a municipal corporation has no authority to make an expenditure of public funds for the purpose of influencing legislation. While there is language to be found in some of the decisions of this state which might be taken as holding that an irrigation district is a municipal corporation (People v. Cardiff Irr. Dist., 51 Cal. App. 307, 312 [197 Pac. 384]), we think that the great weight of authority is to the effect that an irrigation district is not strictly a municipal corporation (Huck v. Rathjen, 66 Cal. App. 84 [225 Pac. 33]; Whiteman v. Anderson-Cotton-Wood Irr. Dist., 60 Cal. App. 234, 243 [212 Pac. 706]; Turlock Irr. Dist. v. White, 186 Cal. 183 [17 A. L. R. 72, 198 Pac. 1060]). In 326 CRAWFORD v. IMPERIAL IRRIGATION DIST. [200 Cal.

the Turlock case the court said (page 187): "The nature of an irrigation district has been a matter of judicial investigation and interpretation, and it has been held that such a corporation is not a municipal corporation, but a 'public corporation for municipal purposes.'" (Citing authorities.) "As to swamp-land, drainage, levee, and reclamation districts, similar to irrigation districts, it has been held that they were not municipal corporations." (Citing authorities.) In *Bettencourt v. Industrial Acc. Com.*, 175 Cal. 559 [166 Pac. 323], it was held on page 561 that: "But reclamation districts organized as was this petitioner possess no political nor governmental powers, are not organized for political or governmental purposes, and are therefore not public corporations at all. Indeed, they are not in strictness corporations, public or private, but governmental mandatories or agents vested with limited powers to accomplish limited and specific work." It is not necessary for our purposes to determine the strict legal status of an irrigation district, but it is evident from the decisions of this state, only a few of which have been referred to above, that an irrigation district is not strictly speaking a municipal corporation. This circumstance only becomes important when we come to examine certain authorities relied upon by the parties hereto which will be later referred to.

[5] An irrigation district, like any other public or private corporation, derives its powers from the statute under which it is created and acts, and from such other statutes as may have been enacted by the legislature granting it additional powers or limiting those already granted. These powers are as different from those exercised by a strictly municipal corporation as the purposes of an irrigation district differ from those of a city or county or other strictly municipal corporation. We must, therefore, consult the statutes of the state in the first instance, at least, to determine the extent of the powers which may be legally exercised by an irrigation district. The extent of these powers is found in the main in those sections of the statutes defining the powers of boards of directors of such districts. The principal provisions of the statutes affecting the powers of boards of directors are contained in the following sections of the statutes of our state: Jan. 1927.] CRAWFORD v. IMPERIAL IRRIGATION DIST. 327

Section 15 of the California Irrigation District Act of 1897, under which the Imperial Irrigation District was organized and is now operating, provides:

"The board of directors shall have the power and it shall be their duty to manage and conduct the business and affairs of the district; make and execute all necessary contracts; employ and appoint such agents, officers, and employees as may be required, and prescribe their duties. . . . Said board shall also have the right to acquire, by purchase, lease, contract, condemnation, or other legal means, all lands, and waters, and water rights, and other property necessary for the construction, use, supply, maintenance, repair and improvements of said canal, or canals, and works, whether in this or in other states or in a foreign nation, including canals, and works constructed and being constructed by private owners, lands for reservoirs for the storage of needful waters, and all necessary appurtenances, and also where necessary or convenient to said ends to acquire and hold the stock of other corporations domestic or foreign owning waters, canals, waterworks, franchises, concessions or rights. Said board may enter into, and do any acts necessary or proper for the performance of, any agreements with the United States, or any state, county, district of any kind, public or private corporation, association, firm or individual, or any number of them, for the joint acquisition, construction, leasing, ownership, disposition, use, management, maintenance, repair or operation of any rights, works or other property of a kind which might lawfully be acquired or owned by the irrigation district, and may acquire the right to store water in any reservoirs or to carry water through any canal, ditch or conduit not owned or controlled by the district, . . ."

Section 15b of said act further provides that: "The board of directors of any irrigation district may also construct the necessary dams, reservoirs, and works for the collection of water for said district, and do any and every lawful act necessary to be done, that sufficient water may be furnished to each land owner in said district for irrigation and domestic purposes; . . ."

Section 15c provides, among other things, that: "Said board shall have power generally to perform all such acts 328 CRAWFORD v. IMPERIAL IRRIGATION DIST. [200 Cal.

as may be necessary to fully carry out the purposes of this act."

In addition to these sections of the Irrigation District Act, section 1 of the act of 1915 (Stats. 1915, p. 1) provides:

"The board of directors of irrigation districts having an area of more than five hundred thousand acres may expend such sums as may to them seem necessary for the protection of the canal system of such district or of lands within such districts from damage by flood and from the overflow of rivers and may contribute funds for that purpose to be expended by or jointly with the government of the United States of America, or other governments or persons benefited by the same protective work or works. The board of directors of any such irrigation district may also do all things necessary to insure such irrigation system and the lands within such district from any such damage by flood or overflow without first receiving a petition of land owners or freeholders for holding an election to authorize such expenditure." This act has been held to be constitutional and applicable to the Imperial Irrigation District (Wores v. Imperial Irr. Dist., 193 Cal. 609 [227 Pac. 181]).

To briefly epitomize the terms of these sections of the statutes we find that the board of directors of an irrigation district is given power generally to manage the affairs of the district; to execute all necessary contracts; to employ and appoint all agents, officers, and employees and define their duties; to acquire water rights, canals, maintain waterworks, whether in this or any other states or in a foreign nation; to enter into any agreement with the United States or any state or other corporation, public or private or individual, for the joint acquisition, construction, maintenance, or operation of any rights or works that might be lawfully owned by an irrigation district; to do any and all lawful acts necessary to be done that sufficient water may be furnished to the inhabitants of the district for irrigation and domestic purposes and to perform all acts that shall be necessary to fully carry out the purposes of the act under which said district was formed. In addition to these powers conferred generally upon irrigation districts, the board of directors of the Imperial Irrigation District, under the act of 1915, may expend such funds of the district as they may deem necessary for the protection of the canal system and the lands of Jan. 1927.] CRAWFORD v. IMPERIAL IRRIGATION DIST. 329,

the district from damage by flood or the overflow of rivers and may contribute funds to be expended for that purpose by or jointly with the government of the United States of America or other governments or persons benefited by such protection work. From these provisions of the statutes we are impressed with two outstanding features of this legislation. First, that the prime object and purpose of such an organization is to provide water for the use of its inhabitants and land owners for irrigation and domestic purposes, and, secondly, the broad and comprehensive nature of the powers conferred upon the board of directors in order to enable them to accomplish this purpose. We also might emphasize another feature which stands out prominently in this legislation and which, in our opinion, is important in the determination of the question now under consideration. This is the minute particularity and definiteness with which the legislature has given the board of directors power to contract with the United States government as well as with individuals and other public and private corporations for the purposes of acquiring water rights and constructing and operating waterworks and expressly authorizing the district to contribute funds of the district for the purpose of construction of works to be erected by the United States, or jointly by the United States and the district, for the purpose of protecting the canal system and lands of the district from river overflow. In order to perform these duties and execute the powers thus given to the board of directors of the Irrigation District, it is apparent that it may be necessary for the board to adopt some means of bringing to the attention of the United States government or other governments with which the district may wish to enter into contracts the subject matter of the proposed contracts. It also seems apparent to us that occasions may arise when it will be absolutely necessary in the best interests of the district that it be represented in person before the proper boards or instrumentalities of these governments in order that the claims of the district as to the matters before these boards may be understood by the officials charged with the consideration of such matters. In bringing about the execution of a contract with the United States government, such as securing rights of way over the public domain for a canal 330 CRAWFORD v. IMPERIAL IRRIGATION DIST. [200 Cal.

system or the right to take water from a stream under government control and jurisdiction, it may be necessary for the applicant to be represented, either in person or by a duly appointed agent before the Department of the Interior or some board or committee having charge of such matters, and perhaps before Congress itself, when the matters require congressional action, in order to properly present the interest of said district. We think there is no question if the Imperial Irrigation District found it necessary to secure a right of way over the public domain for its canal system, and this right could only be had by the district making a proper showing before the Department of the Interior, that the board of directors would have the power to send a representative before such department for the purpose of properly presenting such matter before said department. And if the project, which the board of directors finds is necessary in order to carry out some of its prescribed duties, requires congressional action before the same may be performed by the district, then we can see little or no difference in sending a representative to present the facts bearing upon the subject of the proposed legislation before the proper committees having the same under consideration than in sending such a representative before the Department of the Interior to present a matter there pending in which the district is interested. To withhold such authority in either case would be to cripple unnecessarily the power of the district to accomplish the purposes of its formation, and might seriously hamper the district in its efforts to secure the very contracts which the statute expressly authorizes it to make and execute with the United States government.

The Swing-Johnson Bill authorizes the construction of a dam in the Colorado River at a point in or near Boulder Canyon and also the construction of a canal from the Laguna Dam in said river to the lands of the Imperial Irrigation District. The dam and canal are to be built according to the terms of said bill by the United States government and the former is to be paid for by revenues to be derived from the leasing of power privileges incident thereto and the latter by the lands to be benefited thereby. This case was submitted in its entirety upon an agreed statement of facts. This statement recites at some length the problems of the Imperial Irrigation District and its efforts to secure an ade- Jan. 1927.] CRAWFORD v. IMPERIAL IRRIGATION DIST. 331

quate water supply for the use of its inhabitants for irrigation and domestic purposes, and protection of the district from the flood waters of the Colorado River. It is not necessary to enter into the details of this lengthy statement of facts. A portion of paragraph XIV of the agreed statement reads as follows: "It is necessary that said Swing-Johnson Bill or similar legislation by the Congress of the United States, be enacted in order that water may be furnished to the land owners within the boundaries of Imperial Irrigation District for irrigation and domestic use and that it is necessary that said Swing-Johnson Bill or similar legislation be passed by the Congress of the United States to prevent the destruction of the properties of the said district and the inhabitants thereof from floods of the Colorado River; . . . that said Swing-Johnson Bill is designed primarily for the relief and benefit and protection of the Imperial Irrigation District." From another portion of the agreed statement of facts it appears that the only source from which said district can secure an adequate or, for that matter, any supply of water is the Colorado River and, furthermore, due to the fact that said district is situated from one hundred to three hundred feet below the river-bed of said river, it is seriously menaced by having its lands overflowed and destroyed by the flood waters of said river. In fact, it is expressly stipulated as to the flood menace that "within a period of from ten to twenty years the basin where the river now flows will be entirely filled with silt and sediment and that in that event there will be no place for the river to flow except into the Imperial Valley and onto the lands within the Imperial Irrigation District, and that the river will so flow into said district and completely inundate and destroy the same and the property values therein and drive the inhabitants therefrom if adequate means are not promptly provided to thoroughly regulate the river, desilt the water, and control the floods by means of one or more great storage reservoirs in the upper reaches of the river."

The district is not financially able to construct said dam and canal, and if it were able it has no authority from the United States or the states in which said dam would necessarily have to be located to build said dam. From these facts it appears that the only means whereby said district can hope to obtain a supply of water for irrigation and do- 332 CRAWFORD v. IMPERIAL IRRIGATION DIST. [200 Cal.

mestic purposes and to secure protection from destruction of the lands therein by the flood waters of the Colorado River is through a contract with the United States government. It is the object and purpose of the Swing-Johnson Bill to enable the government to enter into such a contract with the district. The purpose of employing Mr. Fly and sending him to Washington is to enable the district, through him, to present the facts bearing upon the subject matter of the proposed legislation before the committees in Congress having this bill under consideration. We think it is plainly within the powers of the board of directors of said district to furnish to Congress all the information in its possession which might tend in any manner to enlighten the members of that body upon the pending bill, and if in the judgment of the board of directors this can best be done by having a representative of the district appear personally before the committees of Congress, then in our opinion said board of directors is authorized to employ and send to Congress such a representative.

We do not think this conclusion is contrary to any of the authorities cited by the respondent and the *amici curiae* in this action. The cases mainly relied upon by them as announcing a different doctrine are *County of Colusa v. Welch*, 122 Cal. 428 [55 Pac. 243], *Valentine v. Robertson*, 300 Fed. 521, and *State ex rel. Rice v. Bell*, 124 Wash. 647 [215 Pac. 326]. In the first two of these three cases the right of a strictly municipal corporation to employ a representative to appear before a legislative body to influence legislation in which the municipality had only an indirect interest was involved. In each case it was decided that no such authority was given to the governing body of such municipality and that public funds could not be expended for such purpose. In the case of *State ex rel. Rice v. Bell*, *supra*, the supreme court of the state of Washington decided that an irrigation district known as the Quincy Valley Irrigation District, organized under the laws of that state, had no authority to pay the expenses of its engineer in attending the Western States Irrigation Congress, held at San Francisco, for the purpose of interesting said irrigation congress in a bill then pending before the Congress of the United States known as the Jones Bill, the passage of which it was thought would be of great benefit to said irrigation Jan. 1927.] CRAWFORD v. IMPERIAL IRRIGATION DIST. 333

district. The court held that the district had no authority to expend public funds to pay the expenses of said engineer in attending said congress. The Jones Bill, so called, was not a measure affecting directly the Quincy Valley Irrigation District, but was a bill applying generally to any irrigation district authorized to issue bonds, and providing a plan whereby the interest on bonds issued under certain conditions might be guaranteed by the United States government. It is obvious that the conditions under which the engineer of this irrigation district was employed differ materially from those surrounding the employment of Mr. Fly by the Imperial Irrigation District. It is to be further noted that all the authorities relied upon by the court in that decision were cases in which the right of a strictly municipal corporation to make expenditures of public funds was involved. In other words, the supreme court of Washington applied the rule applicable to strictly municipal corporations to irrigation districts and accordingly held that the latter were without power to make expenditures of public money for the purposes shown by the facts of said case. This, as we have already seen, we have declined to do, for the reason, as we view the subject, irrigation districts, at least in this state, in certain respects, and particularly in regard to their power to provide the necessary water for the use of lands within the district and to protect them from flood waters, are clothed with most extensive powers, sufficient, we believe, at least to authorize a contract of the character herein under consideration. For this reason we are unable to accept as an authority in the present action the case from the supreme court of the state of Washington.

Neither do we find anything in section 61 of the California Irrigation District Act of 1897 which would lead to a conclusion contrary to that which we have expressed above. This section provides: "The board of directors or other officers of the district shall have no power to incur any debt or liability whatever, either by issuing bonds or otherwise, in excess of the express provisions of this act; and any debt or liability incurred in excess of the express provisions shall be and remain absolutely void; . . ." We think that we have already shown that the employment of Mr. Fly was within the express provisions of the Irrigation Act. It is true that there are no express words to be found in the stat- 334 CRAWFORD v. IMPERIAL IRRIGATION DIST. [200 Cal.

ute authorizing the board to employ a person to attend upon the sessions of Congress in the interest of legislation affecting the district. In like manner there is no express provision of the statute authorizing the board of directors to rent a building in which to carry on the business of the district, but the board is by the terms of the statute authorized to "manage and conduct the business and affairs of the district." The power to carry on the business of the district implies the power to do all things required for that purpose, and this would include the renting of a building in which to transact the business of the district, and a debt or liability incurred for the reasonable rental of a building for such purposes would not be in excess of the express provisions of the act. For like reason it has been held that the board of supervisors, under their general powers to supervise the official conduct of all county officers, may employ an expert to examine the books of said officers (Harris v. Gibbins, 114 Cal. 418 [46 Pac. 292]), and the state board of examiners, under the law as it then existed, defining its powers, which did not include any express authority to employ an expert, might under its general powers appoint such an employee to assist said board in the performance of its duties. (Lewis v. Colgan, 115 Cal. 529 [47 Pac. 357].) [6] "A public officer or board has not only the powers expressly enumerated by law, but also those implied powers which are necessary to the exercise of the powers expressly granted, . . ." (21 Cal. Jur. 874.) So the power to acquire lands and water rights, construct canals and reservoirs, build levees, and otherwise protect property from flood water, and to enter into contracts with private individuals and public corporations and with the several states and the national government, is given to the board of directors of an irrigation district by the express provisions of the act. In the exercise of this power the board of directors have authority to perform all lawful acts necessary to be done in order to accomplish any or all of these purposes. All of these acts, therefore, would be within the express provisions of the act, and any liability incurred by the district in the performance of any of said acts would be a legal claim against the district and entitled to be paid from the funds of said district. Such a liability could not in any way be held to be void as incurred in excess of the express provisions of the act. Jan. 1927.]                                                                 DICKEY v. WALROND.                                                                 335

There is nothing, therefore, to be found in the provisions of said section 61 which affects the legality of the Fly contract.

[7] The judgment is reversed. As the case was submitted upon an agreed statement of facts without any other evidence whatever, findings of fact were unnecessary (24 Cal. Jur. 953). The only question, therefore, before the court was as to what was the law applicable to those facts (Gregory v. Gregory, 102 Cal. 50 [36 Pac. 364]; McMenomy v. White, 115 Cal. 339 [47 Pac. 109]). Any findings of fact made by the court under these circumstances may be disregarded. The trial court is therefore directed to enter a judgment in favor of the defendants, denying plaintiff the relief sought by the complaint herein.

Richards, J., Seawell, J., Preston, J., Langdon, J., and Waste, C. J., concurred.

[1] ESTATES OF DECEASED PERSONS—TESTAMENTARY DISPOSITION TO "HEIRS"—CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION 1334, CIVIL CODE—APPLICATION OF SECTION 1386, CIVIL CODE.—Section 1334 of the Civil Code, where said section legitimately applies, makes section 1386 of the Civil Code applicable, not only for the designation and description of the takers, but also for the purpose of fixing the proportions in which each shall take.

[2] ID.—DEFINITION OF "HEIRS."—The "heirs" of a person are those whom the law appoints to succeed to his estate in case he dies without disposing of it by will.

[3] ID.—SECTION 1386, CIVIL CODE—DESIGNATION OF HEIRS.—Section 1386 of the Civil Code is the source in every case for a designation of the persons to meet the description of heirs.

[4] Id.—CONSTRUCTION OF WILL—WORDS OF DONATION.—Where a will provides, after making certain specific bequests, that the balance of the property shall pass to trustees to be held until two minor sons of the decedent shall reach the age of twenty-one years, and thereupon the estate in fee shall pass in an undivided one-half to the wife of the decedent and an undivided one-fourth to each son, qualified, however, by the provision, that in the event of the death of the wife during the life of the trust, the undivided one-half part that would otherwise have gone to her shall go to her "heirs at law," the words "heirs at law," as used in the will, are to be construed as words of donation and not of limitation; and upon the death of the wife before the termination of the trust the property vests in the heirs of the wife per stirpes, and not per capita, under section 1386 of the Civil Code.

[5] Id.—ESTATE OF WIFE.—Under such a will, the widow of the decedent was not vested with a life estate, with the remainder over to her heirs at law, but at most merely an equitable one during the life of the trust and perhaps for such less time as she might live.

[6] Id.—NATURE OF ESTATE—RULE IN SHELLEY'S CASE.—The fact that the widow had an equitable estate during the life of the trust, in such a case, cannot be held to support a legal estate in remainder predicated thereon, such as would have come under the rule in Shelley's Case.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Superior Court of Fresno County. D. A. Cashin, Judge. Reversed.

The facts are stated in the opinion of the court.

Walter H. Linforth, Edwin V. McKenzie, and Harris, Johnson, Willey & Griffith for Appellants.

Harding & Monroe and A. E. Shaw for Respondent.

PRESTON, J.—This is an appeal by defendant F. P. Roberts from judgment of the superior court of Fresno County in an action to quiet title to an interest under the will and decree of distribution in the estate of W. J. Dickey, deceased. Jan. 1927.] DICKEY v. WALROND. 337

The testator, W. J. Dickey, left surviving him his wife, Marchisi Josephine Dickey; two minor sons, William James Dickey, Jr., and Robert Bernard Dickey; also Frank Fletcher Dickey, plaintiff, the son of his wife by a former marriage.

His will provided for certain specific bequests; then that the balance of the property should pass to three executors, as trustees, to be by them held until the two minor sons should reach the age of twenty-one years; that thereupon the estate in fee should pass as follows: An undivided one-half to his wife and an undivided one-fourth to each son, qualified, however, by the following language, to wit: "In the event of the death of my said wife during the life of this trust, then the undivided one-half part that would otherwise have gone to her shall go to her heirs at law." The language of the will was carried into the decree of distribution.

After the death of the testator, his widow intermarried with defendant Frank P. Roberts, and thereafter on January 28, 1923, she died, leaving a last will and testament. The two sons of the trustor were living and still minors; her own son, Frank Fletcher Dickey, and her husband, Frank P. Roberts, also survived her. Frank Fletcher Dickey thereupon commenced this action to quiet title, including as defendants in his complaint the surviving trustees, Frank P. Roberts individually and as executor of the last will and testament of Marchisi Roberts, deceased, and said two minor sons.

The trial court made a finding as follows: "That as heirs of the said Marchisi Roberts, deceased, the said plaintiff and the defendants, Robert Bernard Dickey, William James Dickey and Frank P. Roberts are the owners subject to the trust hereinafter mentioned in equal shares of the undivided one-half of the property of said W. J. Dickey, deceased . . ." Being dissatisfied with the portion so decreed to him, Frank P. Roberts took this appeal under section 953a of the Code of Civil Procedure, claiming that the court erred in applying the rule of per capita distribution and that it should have applied the rule of per stirpes distribution under section 1386 of the Civil Code.

200 Cal.—22 338 DICKEY v. WALROND. [200 Cal.

The disposition of said appeal is controlled and determined by the proper interpretation of section 1334 of the Civil Code as explained by section 1335 thereof, when construed in the light of section 1386 and also sections 778 and 779. The relevant portions of these sections are as follows:

Section 1334: "A testamentary disposition to 'heirs' . . . of any person, without other words of qualification, and when the terms are used as words of donation, and not of limitation, vests the property in those who would be entitled to succeed to the property of such person, according to the provisions of the title on succession, in this code."

Section 1335: "The terms mentioned in the last section are used as words of donation, and not of limitation, when the property is given to the person so designated, directly, and not as a qualification of an estate given to the ancestor of such person."

Section 1386: "When any person having title to any estate not otherwise limited by marriage contract, dies without disposing thereof by will, it is succeeded to and must be distributed, unless otherwise expressly provided in this code and the Code of Civil Procedure, . . . in the following manner: . . . "

Section 778: "A remainder may be limited on a contingency which, in case it should happen, will operate to abridge or determine the precedent estate; and every such remainder is to be deemed a conditional limitation."

Section 779: "When a remainder is limited to the heirs, or heirs of the body, of a person to whom a life estate in the same property is given, the persons who, on the termination of the life estate, are the successors or heirs of the body of the owner for life, are entitled to take by virtue of the remainder so limited to them, and not as mere successors of the owner for life."

Appellant contends that section 1334 above quoted meets and disposes of the question by requiring full application of section 1386, both as to names of takers under the will and as to the proportion in which each heir shall take. On the other hand, respondent contends that section 1334, by reason of sections 778 and 779, is wholly inapplicable under the facts of the present case and that section 1386 may be resorted to only for the names or description of the class of individuals who are to take and that when said class is Jan. 1927.] DICKEY v. WALROND. 339

ascertained they necessarily take *per capita* and not *per stirpes*.

[1] We entertain no doubt that in a case where section 1334 legitimately applies, the section makes applicable section 1386, not only for the designation and description of the takers, but also for the purpose of fixing the proportions in which each shall take. This construction is forced upon us by reason of its connection with other sections in the same chapter and also by the provisions of said section itself, for it provides that if there are qualifying words or if the words are words of limitation and not of donation, the property does not vest according to the provisions of the title on succession. This means that in some cases the property will vest under the statute and in other cases it will not so vest. The query at once arises as to what the difference is between the case where the property does vest and the case where the property does not vest according to the law of succession.

[2] "The word 'heirs' means the persons who would be entitled to succeed at his death to his estate in case of intestacy, by virtue of our statutes relative to succession." (*Estate of Wilson*, 184 Cal. 63 [193 Pac. 581]. See, also, *Ginochio v. San Francisco*, 194 Cal. 159, 167 [228 Pac. 428].) "The 'heirs' of a person are those whom the law appoints to succeed to his estate in case he dies without disposing of it by will." (*Hochstein v. Berghauser*, 123 Cal. 681, 687 [56 Pac. 547, 549]. See, also, to the same effect, *Estate of Watts*, 179 Cal. 20 [175 Pac. 415].) The husband under our law is, of course, an heir of his deceased wife. (*In re Dobbel*, 104 Cal. 432 [43 Am. St. Rep. 123 [38 Pac. 87]; *Hochstein v. Berghauser*, 123 Cal. 681, 687, 688 [56 Pac. 547].) [3] These authorities must be interpreted as meaning that section 1386 is the source in every case for a designation of the persons who meet the description of heirs.

Therefore, since we must resort to section 1386 in every case for the designation of persons who take as heirs at law of a decedent, it must follow that the words "vests the property . . . according to the provisions of the title on succession, in this code" mean more than a mere designation or description; otherwise these words must be construed as surplusage. But section 1386 contains only two ingredients, 340 DICKEY v. WALROND. [200 Cal.

to wit: "designation" and "proportions"; if it means more than mere designation, it must include proportions. In other words, it is impossible to give any meaning to the said phrase if it does not mean that the estate shall vest in the persons designated in the proportions declared in said statute.

Then, too, this question was fairly before the court in the *Estate of Watts, supra*, where it was said: "Under section 1327 of the Civil Code, 'Technical words in a will are to be taken in their technical sense, unless the context clearly indicates a contrary intention . . .' It is further provided by section 1334 of the same code that 'a testamentary disposition to "heirs," "relations," "nearest relations," "representatives," "legal representatives," or "personal representatives," or "family," "issue," "descendants," "nearest" or "next of kin" of any person, without other words or qualification, and when the terms are used as words of donation, and not of limitation, vests the property in those who would be entitled to succeed to the property of such person, according to the provisions of the title on succession, in this code.' Both sections are directly applicable here. The word 'heirs' is a technical term, and is used to designate 'the persons who would by the statute succeed to the real estate (or, in California, estate of any kind) in case of intestacy.' (*Clarke v. Cordis*, 4 Allen [Mass.], 446, 480.) 'The "heirs" of a person,' said this court in *Hochstein v. Berghauser*, 123 Cal. 681, 687 [56 Pac. 547, 549]), 'are those whom the law appoints to succeed to his estate in case he dies without disposing of it by will.'

"In the will of Mrs. Watts there are no qualifying terms to limit or explain the ordinary meaning of the word 'heirs.' The testatrix says simply that she gives the residue to her heirs. The further provision that it is 'to be distributed to them according to law' only serves to strengthen the conclusion that she was directing that the property should go just as it would have gone under the statute of descent in the absence of any testamentary disposition."

This meaning was emphasized in the second appeal (186 Cal. 102, 109 [198 Pac. 1036, 1039]), where this court again said: "By the will of Lydia M. Watts, as has been seen, her Jan. 1927.] DICKEY v. WALROND. 341

property was to go to her heirs. In the former decision in this estate it was expressly held that this meant that it should go to her heirs as they were defined in subdivision 8 aforesaid in the same manner as if she had died intestate. We have no disposition now to revise that opinion, and hold that it goes in some other proportions, especially in view of the precise language of the code just quoted."

It is not a just comment on the decisions in the *Estate of Watts, supra*, to say that the phrase "and to be distributed according to law" qualifies the words "to my heirs," for the court expressly held that said phrase but emphasized and made clear the meaning of the preceding one. (See, also, *Estate of Page*, 181 Cal. 537–539 [185 Pac. 383].) It should also be noted that the courts of practically all of the other states are in accord with this holding and there is like unanimity among the text-writers.

The case of *DeLaurencel v. DeBoom*, 67 Cal. 362 [7 Pac. 758], is cited as being opposed to the above views. We find nothing in that case that would justify such a claim. There is no conflict between *DeLaurencel v. DeBoom* and the *Estate of Watts*. The "heirs" mentioned in the *DeLaurencel* will were determined by subdivision 5 of section 1386 of the Civil Code. Descent by the terms of this subdivision, it has been held in *Estate of Nigro*, 172 Cal. 474, 479 [156 Pac. 1019], should be *per capita* and not by right of representation.

The other cases relied upon by respondent are *Burke v. Modern Woodmen of America*, 2 Cal. App. 611 [84 Pac. 275], and *Cooper v. Wilder*, 111 Cal. 191 [52 Am. St. Rep. 163, 43 Pac. 591], but these cases are not subject in any sense to the provisions of the chapter of the Civil Code upon the interpretation of wills, and indeed wills are to receive a more liberal construction than grants or contracts. These cases too are earlier expressions of the court without any reference to section 1334 and cannot, therefore, be held to control our action in the case now before us.

[4] Having thus concluded that section 1334 controls in cases where the word "heirs" is unqualified and is a word of donation as distinguished from a word of limitation, we now pass to an examination of the will before us to ascertain its meaning in the use of the words "heirs at law." In other words, we are to ascertain whether the words "heirs at law" 342 DICKEY v. WALROND. [200 Cal.

as used in the will before us are to be construed as words of donation or of limitation, there being no words of qualification in the will.

Section 1335 above quoted furnishes the key to this solution by providing that such words are words of donation and not of limitation "when the property is given to the person so designated, directly, and not as a qualification of an estate given to the ancestor of such person." At this juncture, we are met by the contention of respondent that in every case where the rule in Shelley's Case would have applied, the words must be considered words of limitation and not of donation, and thereby exclude the application of section 1334. In other words, in a case where the rule in Shelley's Case would apply, had it not been abrogated, the words "heirs at law" are words of limitation, and since the abrogation of the rule are to be held as words of purchase. Therefore, by virtue of such decisions as *Barnett v. Barnett*, 104 Cal. 298, 301 [37 Pac. 1049], the words must be held to designate a class only and, so designating, the class take equally and not *per stirpes*.

[5] This contention brings us face to face with the question: Was there by this will a vested life estate in the widow, Marchisi Dickey Roberts, with a remainder over to her heirs at law? If so, the words are words of limitation and not of purchase and the said heirs at law are the designation of a class.

We are unable to place any construction upon said testament that would give to the widow a vested estate, with a remainder over to her heirs at law. The devise was an express trust for a definite period of years, to wit, until the youngest son of the testator should reach the age of twenty-one years. The trust estate was not measured by the life of either the widow or any of the children. It was measured solely by a definite term of years. Indeed, in this very case the trust continued after the death of the widow and the full measure of the right of the widow during the life of the trust was to compel the performance by the trustees of their duties thereunder and to secure for herself a portion of the income thereof provided for her in the will. She was in no sense a life tenant. The most that her estate could be during the life of the trust was an equitable one for the Jan. 1927.]                                                                 DICKEY v. WALROND.                                                                 343

period thereof and perhaps for such less time as she might live.

In *Hunt v. Hunt*, 124 Mich. 502 [83 N. W. 371], the court had before it a clause in a will reading as follows: "I do hereby will, devise, and bequeath, to my executors hereinafter named, and to the survivor of them, my farm . . . in which Mrs. Henry Hunt, widow, has a life estate, in trust, however, for the following purpose, viz., To sell and dispose of the same as soon as convenient after the death of Mrs. Henry Hunt and the termination of said life estate, and invest the proceeds . . . and pay over, as fast as received, the income and interest thereof, equally, to my two sons, Charles James Hunt and Joseph Nathan Hunt, share and share alike, as long as they shall live; and, upon the death of either of them, to pay over one-half of the same to his heirs, devisees, or legatees, including principal and interest."

In disposing of the contention of Charles Hunt that by reason of the death of his brother the trust had terminated and was subject to cancellation the court said: "The mistake of Charles lies in his assumption that he is a life tenant, with the devise over to his heirs. There is no life estate created by the will. The absolute title is vested in the trustees, and they alone have the right of possession. Upon them alone is the legal duty to pay the taxes, and to protect and care for the property. The interests of Charles and Joseph as *cestuis que trustent* have none of the attributes of a life tenancy. The trustees alone are charged with the control of the property. . . . They cannot surrender the trust to their *cestuis que trustent*. They can only surrender it to their successors duly appointed by the chancery court. The only right Charles and Joseph can enforce against the trustees is the payment to them of the income and the faithful performance of the trust. This was all the testatrix intended they should have. There is no legal objection to such a trust. Upon Charles and Joseph she conferred the right to direct a testamentary disposition of the property upon the termination of the trust by their deaths. If they chose not to make such disposition, then the trustees under the will were directed to pay the fund or to deed the land over to the heirs of each. If there were no trust, and the devise were 344 DICKEY v. WALROND. [200 Cal.

to Charles and Joseph for life, with the remainder over to their heirs, then undoubtedly they would take an allodial estate under *Fraser v. Chene* [2 Mich. 81], *supra*."

It will be noted that the trust provisions in this will are much stronger than the provisions of the will before us. In that case the trust endured during the life of the beneficiaries, while in the case before us it exists only for a term of years. We then conclude that during the life of the trust the widow had only a claim upon the income and no legal estate in the *corpus* thereof. (See *Estate of Shaw*, 198 Cal. 352 [246 Pac. 48].)

What was her estate, if any, after the death of her husband, independent of the trust provisions? Plainly, it was a fee if she survived the termination of the trust period and nothing if she did not. In other words, it was an estate on condition precedent as provided in sections 709 and 1346 of our Civil Code. (See, also, *Estate of Glenn*, 177 Cal. 347, 350, 352 [170 Pac. 833].)

In the last cited case the court was construing a will which contained the following provision: "Fifth. If my said wife and all my children and their children shall die before the death of both of my said brothers Peter and Vincent then it is my will that all my property shall go to my said two brothers Peter and Vincent for their lives and upon their death the same shall go to and vest in my other brothers and sisters in equal shares and as to any brother or sister who is now dead or who may die before the death of said Peter and Vincent, it is my will that his or her share shall go to his or her heirs." Speaking of this provision the court said: "That the death of the wife and issue before the death of the brothers Peter and Vincent was a condition precedent applying to the entire disposition in the fifth clause to such brothers, with remainder to the other brothers and sisters and heirs, seems too plain for argument . . ."

Here it is perfectly plain that with reference to the trust estate, the widow had what is known as a contingent remainder and so did her heirs at law. (*Hunt v. Lawton*, 76 Cal. App. 655 [245 Pac. 803].) But as between themselves, it is impossible to say under the terms of this will that the widow took a life estate with a remainder over to her heirs at law. The estate given the wife and the estate given the Jan. 1927.]                                                                 DICKEY v. WALROND.                                                                 345

children, if either of them took effect, would be a fee. If the fee vested in the wife the heirs at law were excluded. In other words, both the estate of the wife and the estate of the heirs at law are estates in fee on conditions precedent and neither of them can be said to be a remainder interest upon a vested estate granted to the other. Their rights are in the alternative. The widow either takes it all or nothing, and the heirs at law take the whole estate or nothing.

We, therefore, have no hesitancy in concluding that the bequest in said will to the heirs at law of Marchisi Dickey Roberts was a direct bequest within the meaning of section 1335 of the Civil Code and was not in any sense a qualification of an estate given to her.

In this connection respondent also invokes the provisions of section 778 of the Civil Code above quoted. Manifestly that section is inapplicable to the facts in this case, for, as we have found, no estate of any kind vested in Marchisi Dickey Roberts, as between her heirs at law and herself. There is in such case no precedent estate which could be abridged or determined by the happening of any contingency. (See Civ. Code, sec. 769; also, *Gray v. Union Trust Co.*, 171 Cal. 637, 642 [154 Pac. 306].)

[6] The fact that the widow had an equitable estate during the life of the trust cannot be held to support a legal estate in remainder predicated thereon so as to make such a set of facts as would have brought into operation the rule in Shelley's Case. That rule briefly defined is as follows: "When a person takes an estate of freehold, legally or equitably, under a deed, will, or other writing, and in the same instrument there is a limitation by way of remainder, either with or without the interposition of another estate, of an interest of the same legal or equitable quality, to his heirs, or heirs of his body, as a class of persons to take in succession, from generation to generation, the limitation to the heirs entitles the ancestor to the whole estate." (1 Preston on Estates, secs. 263–419; 4 Kent's Commentaries, 14th ed., marg. pp. 215, 216.)

One of the cardinal requirements of that rule was that the vested and remainder estates must both be legal or both be equitable and if the two estates did not so conform, it could not be held applicable. "But if the estate limited to the 346 DICKEY v. WALROND. [200 Cal.

ancestor be merely an equitable or trust estate, and the subsequent limitation to his heirs carries the legal estate, the two estates will not incorporate into an estate of inheritance in the ancestor, as would have been the case under the rule in Shelley's Case, if they had been of one quality, that is, both legal and both equitable estates; and the limitation to the heirs will operate as a contingent remainder." (4 Kent's Commentaries, 14th ed., marg. p. 211.)

"By his deed the grantor gave the legal estate in his property to the trustees named in his deed, and created for himself an equitable life estate, with a contingent remainder to his right heirs upon his dying leaving no children, or descendants, or widow living at the time of his death; or, in case of his leaving no children so living, and leaving a widow surviving him, then, after providing the equitable life estate for himself, he gave an equitable life estate to such widow, and remainder to his right heirs. As the preceding life estate in the grantor was an equitable estate, and the remainder to the heirs a legal estate, this limitation is not within the rule in Shelley's Case, and the limitation over to the heirs was good as a contingent remainder. Mercer v. Hopkins, 88 Md. 309, 310 [41 Atl. 156], and cases there cited; 4 Kent Comm., marg. pp. 210, 211." (Mercer v. Safe Deposit & Trust Co., 91 Md. 102 [45 Atl. 865].)

In Howard v. Trustees, 88 Md. 309, 310 [41 Atl. 156], we have this language: "Some of the appellants earnestly contend that under the rule in Shelley's Case this life estate becomes an absolute estate, and some of them deny this proposition with quite as much earnestness. We may as well dispose of this question here. It is well settled that, in order to coalesce and form one absolute estate under this rule, the two estates must be of the same quality—both must be equitable or both legal. (Ware v. Richardson, 3 Md. 505 [56 Am. Dec. 762]; Handy v. McKim, 64 Md. 659 [4 Atl. 125].) In order to make this rule apply to the devisees under consideration, it would be necessary to cast aside the express language used by the testator by which he declared that the legal estate should be held by the trustees in trust for the life tenant, and from the expiration of the equitable life tenancy in trust for the period of twenty years, when the estate was to vest absolutely in the children or Jan. 1927.] DICKEY v. WALROND. 347

descendants of such life tenant, if any, and in default of any such issue living at the time, then in the persons who should answer to the description of heirs at law of such life tenant. Here we have the equitable life estate, and a subsequent fee simple or absolute estate. Under the circumstances it is settled the rule in Shelley's Case cannot be invoked."

We thus conclude that the bequest in the will before us was as to the heirs at law of Marchisi Dickey Roberts words of donation and not of limitation. In other words, that they took thereunder not by virtue of their relationship to her but as a "designation of persons to take originally in their own right." (1 Preston on Estates, 264.)

It is not necessary here to pause to consider the reasons which may have prompted the legislature in the enactment of section 1334, nor to furnish reasons why wills should be in a class to themselves when questions like this are up for determination. This section doubtless serves to settle many questions which otherwise would be unsettled and indeed announces many rules which are in derogation of the common-law rules governing estates. It may also be noted in passing that reference has been made recently to section 1334 making its provisions applicable without any particular consideration having been given as to whether the words were to be considered words of donation or words of limitation. (See *Estate of Trickett*, 197 Cal. 20 [239 Pac. 406].)

Learned counsel with much earnestness have urged upon the court the harshness of a rule which would give to the surviving husband of his former widow a greater portion of a decedent's estate than that received by his own children. But the fault, if any, is to be found in section 1386 and not in section 1334. Indeed, cases are easily supposable in which the rule contended for by respondent would create equal harshness; for example, a bequest to the heirs at law of a person, said heirs being two sisters and the children of a deceased sister or brother, say six in number. Under the rule contended for by respondent, the surviving sisters, instead of getting one-third each, would each get only one-eighth, so we must concede there was the proper modicum of wisdom in the enactment of this statute. 348 RUSSELL v. RAMM. [200 Cal.

These conclusions make necessary a reversal of the judgment of the court below, and it is so ordered, with instructions to said court to enter a decree in accordance with this opinion.

Richards, J., Seawell, J., and Curtis, J., concurred.

SHENK, J., Dissenting.—I dissent. Under the terms of the will in question the estate that vested in the heirs of the widow was, in my opinion, a contingent remainder with an equitable life estate in the widow. Such being the case, section 1334 of the Civil Code and Estate of Watts, 179 Cal. 20 [175 Pac. 415], have no application. On the other hand, section 779 of the same code and Barnett v. Barnett, 104 Cal. 298 [37 Pac. 1049], would compel distribution per capita to the heirs of the widow. I think the superior court was right and that the judgment should be affirmed.

Waste, C. J., concurred.

Rehearing denied.

A. E. RUSSELL et al., Respondents, v. CHARLES H. RAMM, Appellant.

[1] BROKER'S COMMISSIONS—FINANCIAL ABILITY AND WILLINGNESS OF PURCHASER—SUFFICIENCY OF EVIDENCE.—In this action by a real estate broker to recover commissions for services in the proposed sale of real and personal property, it is held that the evidence was sufficient to make a prima facie showing that the proposed purchasers were ready, able, and willing to complete the transaction had the seller not repudiated the same, and that the burden was cast upon the defendant to overcome the showing, and that as the showing was not overcome, it is sufficient to base a finding upon in favor of the plaintiff. Jan. 1927.] RUSSELL v. RAMM. 349

[2] Id.—PLEADING—DEFECT IN AMENDED COMPLAINT—CURING BY ANSWER.—In such a case, the failure of an amended complaint to contain an averment that the plaintiffs procured a purchaser for the property referred to in the agreement and described in the amended complaint who was ready, willing, and able to purchase the same, is cured by an answer admitting the execution of the agreement and authority in the plaintiffs to negotiate the sale upon the terms specified, but expressly denying that plaintiffs procured, at the time and upon the terms and conditions specified in the agreement, a party willing, able, and ready to purchase the property, especially where the case was tried upon the theory that such issue was tendered by the pleadings.

[3] Id.—ANSWER TO AMENDED PLEADING.—The rule, as generally approved by the authorities, is that a plea to the original declaration will be treated as a plea to an amended declaration, if applicable and responsive thereto, but if not responsive it will be treated as a nullity.

[4] Id.—DEFECTIVE PLEADING—OBJECTION TO EVIDENCE.—Where a complaint attempts to set forth matters essential to the statement of a cause of action, but does not fully measure up to indispensable requirements, and yet contains an allegation from which an essential fact is necessarily to be implied, an objection to evidence upon the ground that such issue has not been raised in the complaint should be as specific as an objection to a complaint by demurrer upon the ground of uncertainty or ambiguity.

[5] Id.—CONFLICTING EVIDENCE—APPEAL.—Where there is a substantial conflict in the evidence, the decision of the jury or trial court upon the facts is conclusive and binding upon the courts of review.

[6] Id.—REFUSAL OF OWNER TO SELL—RIGHT OF BROKER TO COMMISSION.—Where the owner of the property, in such a case, refuses to sell to the purchaser procured by the broker upon any ground other than that of the inability of the proposed purchaser to purchase, the owner cannot, in an action against him by the broker for compensation, successfully set up such ground as a defense, unless the fact constituting that ground is included in the agreement between the owner and broker as one of the terms or conditions which must be met or complied with by the broker before he has earned or is entitled to compensation for his services.

[7] Id.—REFUSAL OF WIFE TO JOIN IN CONVEYANCE.—It is the general rule in such a case that the refusal of the wife of the owner to join in a conveyance of the property to the proposed vendee does

not in itself operate to deprive the broker of his right to compensation.

[8] Id.—DEMAND FOR ABSTRACT OF TITLE—CONSTRUCTION OF CONTRACT. In such a case, where the contract authorizing the brokers to obtain the purchasers expressly provided that the owner should furnish to any proposed buyer a "deed and abstract, or certificate of title, showing clear title in" the owner to date, a demand by the proposed purchasers, as a condition to the execution of a contract of sale, for a certificate of title, was within the terms of the contract, and the contention that this provision meant that the owner was to furnish an abstract or certificate of title only when the deed was tendered, and not at the time the contract of sale was executed, cannot be maintained.

[9] Id.—DESCRIPTION OF LAND—UNCERTAINTY—CURING OF.—Much greater liberality is allowed in construing and curing defective descriptions of property in brokers' contracts than in deeds to land, for, so far as the statute of frauds is concerned, the terms of the employment are the essential part, and such contracts will not be declared void merely because of a defect, uncertainty, or ambiguity in the description of the property to be sold or exchanged when such defect can be cured by the allegation or proof of extrinsic facts and circumstances.

[10] Id.—STATUTE OF FRAUDS—PLEADING.—In order that the defendant in any case may avail himself of the benefit of the statute of frauds, where it does not appear from the face of the complaint that the statute has not been complied with, it is necessary that it should be pleaded and proved.

Short, Lindsay & Woolley, Leroy G. Smith, W. M. Conley, Philip Conley, George Cosgrave and Lindsay & Conley for Appellant.

Harris & Hayhurst and R. E. Gibson for Respondents.

RICHARDS, J.—The petition for a hearing herein after decision by the district court of appeal in and for the third appellate district was granted chiefly for the reason that the opinion of Mr. Justice Hart therein did not refer to or sufficiently distinguish the decision of this court in the case of *Merzoian v. Kludjian*, 183 Cal. 422 [191 Pac. 673], from the case at bar. We are of the opinion that both as to the facts and the principles of law involved the cases are easily distinguishable. In the case of *Merzoian v. Kludjian*, *supra*, it affirmatively appeared that the purchaser who had been procured by the broker as one ready, able, and willing to purchase the property in question had neither the money, nor the property, nor the credit which would suffice to enable him unaided to complete said purchase according to the terms of his contract. In the case at bar a quite different situation is presented. The proffered purchasers were two brothers, named Fred W. and H. H. Moore, both of whom had made a written offer to purchase the Ramm properties, by the terms of which they were to make, and did make, a deposit of $1,000 at the time of such offer and were to pay "$34,000 additional when you shall furnish certificate or abstract of title from which it shall appear that you can convey good title, . . . It being understood that at the time of such payment of $34,000 formal contract of sale is to be executed." The foregoing offer was verbally accepted by the seller, it being understood that a more formal contract was thereafter to be executed. Fred W. Moore was called and examined as a witness for plaintiff with respect to the readiness, ability, and willingness of himself and his brother to complete their proposed purchase of said properties. He testified that he had resided for several years at Dinuba, where the Ramm properties were situated, and was familiar with said properties and was also on sufficiently familiar terms of acquaintance with the owner thereof to call him "Charlie," from which 352 RUSSELL v. RAMM. [200 Cal.

fact it might well be inferred that the owner was equally familiar with the properties and financial standing of his neighbors, the proposed purchasers, and for that reason did not urge their inability to complete the transaction as his ground for repudiating the same. The witness testified that he and his brother had made an offer in writing to purchase said properties; that they were buying the same together; that they were ready, able, and willing to purchase said properties and were able to raise the $35,000 in cash required for the first payment thereon; that they had considerable property at Dinuba and also had considerable of the money in bank; that the witness himself had over $15,000 in bank, and that while he did not know how much his brother had he knew they were able to take care of the deal; that he had several personal interviews with the seller, going over the properties and checking up on the personal property which was to go with the land, as a result of which a formal contract of purchase was drawn, which provided that at the time of the execution and of the production of a sufficient abstract or certificate of title the said installment upon the total purchase price was to be paid; that such formal contract when so drawn was submitted to the seller and was read by him; but that the latter refused to execute the same or to go further with the transaction, giving as his sole ground therefor that his wife would not sign the papers; that both the witness and the agent pursued the seller for several days thereafter in an effort to persuade him to go on with the transaction and that his sole objection to doing so was that his wife would not sign the papers.

[1] We are of the opinion that the plaintiff by the foregoing evidence sufficiently made a *prima facie* showing that the proposed purchasers of the properties in question were ready, able, and willing to complete the transaction had the seller not repudiated the same. We are also of the opinion that the plaintiff having made this *prima facie* showing, the burden was cast upon the defendant to overcome the same, either by developing upon cross-examination that the purchasers' money and property in possession, admittedly considerable, was insufficient to enable them to command adequate credit to complete the negotiations, or by making affirmative proof to the same effect in defense of the plain- Jan. 1927.] RUSSELL v. RAMM. 353

tiff's asserted cause of action. The defendant Ramm, who was living and present at the time of the trial, did neither of these. Upon cross-examination of the purchaser, counsel for defendant made no inquiry into the extent of his properties or those of his brother beyond the inquiry as to the amount of the money of each in bank, and offered no evidence upon that subject in aid of his defense. The plaintiff's *prima facie* showing was not therefore broken down; and this being so, it furnished a sufficient basis for the finding of the trial court in the plaintiff's favor upon that issue. As to the principles of law laid down in *Merzoian v. Kludjian*, *supra*, it may be conceded that they were correct as applicable to the facts of that case, but the rule therein declared which would require a would-be purchaser of property to make a showing either that he had the purchase price on hand in the form of money or that he had consummated such a loan upon his available properties or securities in anticipation of the preparation and execution of the formal contract of purchase as would enable him to comply with its terms in advance of its execution, would be to lay down too drastic a rule governing business transactions of the kind presented in the instant case. With respect to the other features of this case treated in the decision of the district court of appeal, we are satisfied with the disposal of the same as embraced in the opinion of Mr. Justice Hart, and we accordingly adopt the same. Said opinion reads as follows:

"Subsequent to the trial of this case the defendant Charles H. Ramm passed away and his widow, Pearl E. Ramm, was duly appointed administratrix of his estate.

"The plaintiffs, duly licensed real estate brokers and engaged in the town of Dinuba, Tulare County, in the business of selling and buying and also negotiating the sale and purchase of real estate for and in behalf of other parties, brought this action to recover from defendant's intestate the sum of $3,250.00, which the complaint alleges constituted the sum total of commissions earned by plaintiffs for procuring purchasers of a certain tract of land of sixty acres and certain personal property belonging to defendant. The complaint alleges that, on or about the 5th day of February, 1920, at said town of Dinuba, the defendant, by an instru-

200 Cal.—23 354 RUSSELL v. RAMM. [200 Cal.

ment in writing appointed plaintiffs to sell said land and personal property for the total sum of $120,000.00. The memorandum of agreement is by the complaint expressly made a part thereof. It reads as follows:

"'Dinuba, Calif. Jan. 5, 1920'

"'I hereby appoint RUSSELL & NEWTON my agents with exclusive right to sell the property described on the reverse side of this sheet, for the sum of $120,000 One Hundred twenty thousand Dollars to be paid as follows, to-wit: Cash on 40 ac $20,000 on 20 ac 15,000.00, payments of terms on 40 ac $2500.00 each year & on 20 ac $1000 each yr until paid with privilege of paying more at any time or any less amount hereafter authorized by me and to receive deposit on same.'

"'I agree to furnish Deed and Abstract, or Certificate of Title showing clear title in me to date, and should Russell & Newton sell such property, or be instrumental in selling the same, I agree to pay them 5 per cent commission on the above named selling price $10000 and bal 2½% commission of the consideration for which said property is sold over and above the purchase price above specified. This authorization is to remain in full force and effect 5 days and thereafter until revoked by me in writing.'

"'Russell & Newton shall be entitled to commission, as above set out, on any sale made to parties to whom they may have shown or exhibited this land during the term of this agreement, even though said sale is not consummated until after the term hereof, and I agree to pay such commission in such event.'

"'Name CHAS. H. RAMM.'

"On the reverse side of said writing are the following notations:

"V.

"That within five (5) days from the making and signing of said memorandum by said defendant, these plaintiffs procured purchasers for said land, to-wit: Fred W. Moore and H. H. Moore, who were and are ready, able and willing to perform said contract to be sold to said purchasers according to the terms set forth in said memorandum of agreement, and said purchasers then and there offered to purchase said land for said price of One Hundred Twenty Thousand Dollars ($120,000.00) according to said terms; that these plaintiffs and said purchasers demanded of defendant that he sell said land to said persons according to the terms of said agreement, and then and there offered to do and perform said agreement in every particular according to the terms thereof.

"VI.

"That said defendant then and there refused to sell said lands to said persons according to the terms of said agreement, or at all, and ever since said date has failed and refused, and now fails and refuses to sell said land upon any terms, or to carry out or perform said agreement.

"VII.

"That by reason of said premises, said plaintiffs have earned as their commissions in procuring said purchasers for said land the sum of Thirty-two Hundred Fifty Dollars ($3250.00), and defendant has become, and is indebted to these plaintiffs in said sum of Thirty-two Hundred Fifty Dollars ($3250.00) and that plaintiffs have demanded of said defendant that he pay to them said sum, but to pay the same or any part thereof, defendant has failed and refuses, and still fails and refuses."

"The answer admits paragraph 1 of the complaint (alleging that Plaintiffs are duly authorized real estate brokers and dealers in real estate), admits paragraph 2 (alleging the appointment of plaintiffs by defendant as his agents to negotiate the sale of the properties referred to in the memorandum of agreement), and also admits the allegations of paragraph 4 (explaining the terms of the authorization to sell), but specifically denies paragraphs 5, 6 and 7 hereinabove presented.

"The cause was tried by the court sitting without a jury. The findings are general and are to the effect that all of the 356 RUSSELL v. RAMM. [200-Cal.

allegations of each and all of the paragraphs of the complaint are true and that 'each and all of the allegations and denials' of paragraphs one, two, five, six and seven of the answer are untrue. Accordingly, the plaintiffs were awarded judgment in the sum of $3,250.00, with interest, etc., and from said judgment the defendants appeal upon a record prepared in accordance with the provisions of section 953a of the Code of Civil Procedure.

[2] "The point first pressed is that an amended complaint, which is in the record, utterly fails to state a cause of action for the relief sought because it contains no averment that the plaintiffs procured a purchaser of the properties referred to in the memorandum of agreement and described in said amended complaint ready, willing and able to purchase the same. The consideration and the disposition of this point will require an explanation of the circumstances under which the so-called amended complaint found its way into the case.

"It will be observed that neither in the memorandum agreement nor in the complaint is there a specific description of the real property which it was claimed by plaintiffs that defendant had authorized them to sell. On the close of their case—that is, after they had completed the introduction of all the testimony they intended to present in their original case—the plaintiffs rested, and the defendant did likewise—that is, he then announced that he had no testimony to offer as in rebuttal of the case made by the plaintiffs. Thereupon one of the attorneys representing the plaintiffs stated to the court that, in view of certain facts which had been developed by the evidence introduced in support of the complaint, he desired to move the court for leave to file an amendment to the complaint so that the pleading of plaintiffs would conform to the proof as made, referring particularly to the evidence disclosing a description by metes and bounds of the real property referred to in the memorandum agreement, and at the same time submitted or read to the court a draft of the proposed amendment, and addressed the court relative thereto as follows: 'If the court please, before the matter of argument, in view of certain testimony that has been introduced, we will ask at this time for leave to amend the complaint in this par- Jan. 1927.] RUSSELL v. RAMM. 357

ticular: Immediately after paragraph 3 we would ask to amend by adding this paragraph, we will call it 3½: The proposed amendment contained a specific description of said real property by metes and bounds and the averment that defendant was, at and prior to the execution of the agreement upon which this action is predicated, the owner of said property. Counsel for defendant promptly objected to the allowance of the amendment on certain grounds, one of the grounds being that defendant had not been served with notice of the application for leave to file the proposed amendment, notice being necessary, since, as the argument proceeded, 'there is nothing here that the defendant is the owner of or ever was the owner of any of this land, and we will have to deny these allegations if the amendment is allowed, and try the case over again.' To which counsel for plaintiffs replied by offering to 'stipulate that they (the allegations of the proposed amendment) be deemed denied,' but counsel for defendant refused to yield assent to that proposition. Thereupon the court stated: 'Well, I think the court, in any event, will reserve the ruling upon this application until we have more time to consider it. I recollect nothing you put in evidence about sandy soil. I recollect nothing in evidence about sandy soil,' the proposed amendment having described the soil of the real property concerned herein as being 'sandy.' The case was thereupon 'submitted on briefs to be filed in 10, 10 and 5 days.' The reporter's transcript or record contains nothing further in relation to the application to amend the complaint as indicated. In other words, there is nothing in said transcript or record indicating that the court ruled on the application, either allowing or disallowing it. The judgment roll, however, embodies, among the other papers constituting the same, not an amendment to the complaint but what purports to be an amended complaint. After stating that it has been filed by leave of the court first had and obtained, 'for the purpose of making said complaint conform to the proofs,' it re-avers paragraphs 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the complaint, omits paragraph 5 of said original pleading, and numbers as paragraph 5 the averments as to the description and ownership by defendant of the real property as they were substantially proposed as an amendment to the complaint, to be numbered 'paragraph 3½,' as hereinabove indicated. The said paragraph 5 is fol- 358 RUSSELL v. RAMM. [200 Cal.

lowed by paragraphs 6 and 7, containing the precise allegations of the paragraphs likewise numbered in the original complaint. The amended pleading was not signed by either of the attorneys for the plaintiffs nor either of the latter, but was verified by the plaintiff Russell on the 27th day of October and filed on the following day, which was ten days after the day (October 18th) on which the trial of the cause was commenced and completed.

"Upon the record as it is thus presented, the defendant, notwithstanding that the reporter's transcript does not directly or expressly show that the court granted the application to file the amended, or amendment to the complaint, invokes the presumption, upon the clerk's certification of the judgment roll, of which the purported amended complaint is made a part, that said amended pleading was filed by leave of the court, and further invokes the rule that the amended complaint supersedes and wholly nullifies the original complaint. (Kuhland v. Sedgwick, 17 Cal. 123; Barber v. Reynolds, 33 Cal. 497; Mecham v. McKay, 37 Cal. 154; Osment v. McElrath, 68 Cal. 466, 470 [58 Am. Rep. 17, 9 Pac. 731]; Pfister v. Wade, 69 Cal. 133, 138 [10 Pac. 369]; Schneider v. Brown, 85 Cal. 205, 206 [24 Pac. 715]; Collins v. Scott, 100 Cal. 446 [34 Pac. 1085]; Ralphs v. Hensler, 114 Cal. 196 [45 Pac. 1062]; Whitehead v. Sweet, 126 Cal. 67 [58 Pac. 376]; Schlake v. Consolidated Concessions Co., 69 Cal. App. 207 [230 Pac. 974].)

"The situation here, upon its face, is rather unique. It is difficult to work out any sound reason for the filing of the amended complaint a number of days after the trial had been completed, or, for that matter, for filing it at all, upon any other theory than that said pleading was intended merely to function as an amendment to the original complaint to the extent only of making the complaint conform to the evidence disclosing the exact description of the real property referred to in the memorandum of agreement. We think it probable that such was the sole purpose of the amended pleading, since it is not conceivable that counsel for the plaintiffs would file an amended complaint pretermitting allegations contained in the original complaint which, it may be assumed not only from their recognized learning in the law but from the fact that they did insert such allegations of fact in their original pleading, counsel well knew Jan. 1927.] RUSSELL v. RAMM. 359

were absolutely necessary to the statement of a cause of action for the relief herein sought. Indeed, we do know, from the proceedings relative to the matter occurring on the close of the taking of testimony, that, in point of fact, the purpose of the plaintiffs was merely to add to the complaint as originally filed another paragraph (to be numbered 3½, as was then suggested) whereby an accurate description of the real property involved therein as it was revealed by the evidence would be set forth in that pleading. We have no doubt that the omission of paragraph five of the original complaint from the amended complaint was unintentional and an inadvertence. These considerations, however, cannot affect or successfully be set up, so far as this court is concerned, in impeachment of the judgment roll as it was certified by the clerk, or, in other words, as against the presumption that the amended complaint, as it itself declares, was filed by and upon the permission of the trial court previously granted, nor can they interrupt the operation of the rule that said amended pleading supersedes and thus has forced from the judgment roll the original complaint. But with these propositions in mind, we are still of the opinion that the essential issues of fact in an action of this character were, nevertheless, herein sufficiently presented and, as so presented, were tried and adjudicated. We have the right to presume that a copy of the amended complaint was duly served on the defendant. At all events, we have it from the record of the proceedings of the trial that the defendant knew that there was a motion made at the close of the plaintiff's case for leave to amend the complaint and that, so far as the record shows to the contrary, was still pending and undisposed of at the time the cause was ordered to be submitted upon briefs to be subsequently filed by the respective counsel. Notwithstanding all this, no demurrer or answer to the amended complaint was filed. The answer to the original complaint, however, is included within the judgment roll here, and we may assume, if not presume, that defendant was content to let the original answer stand as the answer to the amended complaint. [3] The rule, as generally approved by the authorities, is that 'a plea to the original declaration will be treated as a plea to an amended declaration, if applicable and responsive 360 RUSSELL v. RAMM. [200 Cal.

thereto.' Of course, if the answer or plea be not responsive to the complaint or declaration, then it will be treated as a nullity. (See 31 Cyc., pp. 460, 461, and cases cited in the footnotes.) That the answer is responsive to the amended complaint here, there can be no doubt. As pointed out above, the amended complaint contains all the allegations of the original complaint, save and except that expressly and directly asserting that plaintiffs procured purchasers of the properties who were ready, willing and able to purchase the same. Its allegations may, then, thus be summarized: That defendant, in a writing subscribed by him, authorized the plaintiffs to negotiate the sale of the properties on certain terms and conditions and for a specified compensation to plaintiffs; that the real property (specifically described) was that referred to in the memorandum of agreement, and 'that said sixty acres was the real property intended by the parties to said agreement as the property for which the said plaintiffs were to obtain a purchaser as mentioned in said written agreement.' Then follows paragraph six, declaring 'that said defendants then and there refused to sell said lands to said persons according to the terms of said agreement,' etc. This allegation in paragraph six is, of course, entirely too vague and uncertain to justify the declaration that it properly states the fact which it was necessary to allege to state a cause of action, viz.: That the plaintiffs, within the time specified in the agreement, procured a proposed purchaser or proposed purchasers of the properties ready, willing and able to purchase the same 'according to the terms of said agreement,' but the allegation does sufficiently imply that they had procured such purchasers to justify the conclusion that the answer to the original complaint is, in that vital particular, as manifestly it is in the other essential particulars, 'responsive to the amended complaint.' Treating, therefore, said answer as an answer to the amended complaint, we have this situation, viz.: That defendant admits the execution of the written agreement and that thereby he authorized plaintiffs to negotiate the sale of the properties, within the time named, upon the specified terms and conditions, but expressly denies that plaintiffs procured, at the time and upon the terms and conditions specified in the agreement, a party willing, able and ready to purchase the properties. Thus the answer came to the aid Jan. 1927.] RUSSELL v. RAMM. 361

of the amended complaint and cured its defective allegation as to the procurement by plaintiffs, within the time and upon the terms and conditions set forth in the agreement, of purchasers of the properties ready, willing, and able to purchase the same upon said terms and conditions. (Slaughter, Admx., etc., v. Goldberg, Bowen & Co. et al., 26 Cal. App. 318, 324, 325 [147 Pac. 90].) Moreover (still regarding the amended complaint and the answer to the original as the only pleadings in the case), the action was tried upon the theory that the issue as to the procurement of the purchasers of the properties by plaintiffs within the specified time and upon the stipulated terms and conditions was squarely presented and tendered by the pleadings. The evidence addressed to the proof of that fact was offered and received without objection. It is true, that, on a few occasions, objections were interposed by defendant to testimony offered by plaintiffs to support the allegation of the complaint that such purchaser or purchasers were so procured but the objections were not specific but upon the general grounds that the testimony was 'irrelevant, immaterial and incompetent.' [4] Where, as is true of the amended complaint here, a complaint attempts to set forth matters essential to the statement of a cause of action but does not fully measure up to that indispensable requirement, and yet contains an allegation from which an essential fact is necessarily to be implied, the objection to evidence upon the ground that such issue has not been raised in the complaint should be specific (Boyle v. Coast Imp. Co., 27 Cal. App. 714, 720 [151 Pac. 25]), or, in other words, such objection in such case should be as specific as an objection to a complaint by demurrer upon the ground of uncertainty or ambiguity, etc. But another answer to the contention that the judgment is affected by a fatal infirmity in that it is without the support of a complaint which states a cause of action, for the reason that the amended complaint, which supplanted the original, does not contain the essential allegation of the procurement of a purchaser, etc., lies in the indisputable fact that the action, as the court in its findings expressly declared, was tried upon the issues tendered by the answer to the original complaint, and, as seen, one of the issues so directly tendered involved the question whether the 362 RUSSELL V. RAMM. [200 Cal.
plaintiffs, within the time specified, procured a purchaser or purchasers willing, ready and able to purchase the properties upon the terms and conditions upon which plaintiffs were authorized to negotiate the sale of the same. Thus it is perfectly clear, from whatever viewpoint the situation as to the pleadings and the trial may, with legal propriety, be considered, that the question whether the plaintiffs performed the agreement on their part or the services called for thereby was submitted as one of the issues to be tried and adjudicated and which was in fact tried and adjudicated as fully and completely as if the amended complaint had never been introduced into the judgment roll and the pleadings stood only as they were originally filed.

"The point next urged for a reversal is that the findings are not supported by the evidence. The point is without merit. As already stated, the only testimony or evidence presented at the trial was that introduced by plaintiffs, the defendant having rested his case on the proofs so made. As above pointed out, the fact that the defendant's intestate conferred upon plaintiffs authority to obtain a buyer of the land and personal property referred to in the written memorandum mentioned within the time and on the terms and conditions specified in said writing for the compensation also specified therein, was and is admitted. It also stands admitted that, at the time the transactions involved herein took place, the plaintiffs were regularly licensed real estate brokers. The evidence shows that Charles H. Ramm, at all of said times, resided upon a sixty-acre tract of land situated approximately one mile north of the center of the town of Dinuba; that he owned forty acres of said land and was then buying the remainder thereof (20 acres) from his father. Twenty acres of the tract were planted to grapes of the Malaga variety and a like number of acres thereof to grapes of the Emperor variety. A dwelling house of six rooms was standing on the east twenty acres, on twelve acres of which grapes of the Emperor variety, four years old, were growing, and on four and one-half acres of which plum trees were growing. It appears that the proposition to vest plaintiffs with authority to negotiate the sale of the properties was first suggested by defendant's intestate, he having said to them that, on account of ill health, he desired Jan. 1927.] RUSSELL v. RAMM. 363

to dispose of the ranch; that after the said proposition was so made, Newton, one of the plaintiffs, accompanied Mr. Ramm to the ranch, and after inspecting the properties and thus learning what properties, other than the ranch itself, were to be sold through plaintiffs, he (said Newton) immediately proceeded to look for a purchaser of said properties; that he found and took to the ranch certain prospective buyers, and among these were two parties by the names of Fred Moore and Harry Moore, brothers; that the Moores were pleased with the ranch and requested plaintiffs to furnish them with a detailed description of the land and all the other property which was to be embraced within the sale; that Newton thereupon made another visit to the ranch to obtain that information, and, securing it from defendant's intestate, presented it to the Moores. It was further shown that, on several different occasions thereafter, Newton took Mr. Fred Moore to the ranch; that, on one of these occasions, both Newton and said Moore had a conversation with Ramm regarding the personal property which it was intended should 'go with the place,' and also as to the terms upon which it could be purchased. It was shown that it was on the occasion of one of these visits that Newton made out the broker's agreement (attached to and made a part of both the original and amended complaint), and which was then signed by Mr. Ramm on his ranch, authorizing plaintiffs to procure a purchaser of the properties. On the last occasion on which Newton and Fred Moore visited the ranch, the former had in his possession said Moore's check for the sum of $1,000.00, the same to be used as a deposit upon the purchase price of the place. Newton stated to Ramm that he had said check in his possession and tendered it to Ramm, who, thereupon, addressing Newton, said: 'You are my agent—you hold the check.' On the same occasion, Fred Moore said to Ramm: 'I bought your ranch and I want to see the stuff that goes with the place, tools and all,' to which Ramm replied: 'All right,' and thereupon took Newton and Moore over the premises and pointed out the tools, horses and other articles of personal property which were to be included within the sale. It was further shown that on the Monday succeeding the visit to the ranch by Newton and Moore last spoken of, Ramm went to Newton's office and left 364 RUSSELL v. RAMM. [200 Cal.

with the latter a complete list of the tools that were to go with the ranch on the sale thereof. Several days later, in accordance with a previous understanding between the parties, the plaintiff, Newton Ramm and the two Moores, met at the office of Attorney Green, in Dinuba, for the purpose of preparing an agreement of sale. At that meeting, said Green made memoranda of the details of the agreement or the sale with a view of committing the same to writing, but before he had completed the preparation of the contract, Ramm was called to the telephone and immediately thereafter left the lawyer's office, with the understanding that he, with the Moores and Newton, would again meet at said law office and complete the contract by the execution thereof by Ramm and the Moores. This meeting was subsequently held, and at that time the contract, already prepared, was signed by the Moores. Said proposed contract or writing constituted an offer to purchase the properties referred to in the writing, signed by Ramm, authorizing plaintiffs to sell said properties and contained a description of said properties; recited that the Moores had posted with the plaintiffs the sum of $1,000.00, 'as a guaranty of good faith'; that the proposed purchasers would pay to Ramm the additional sum of $34,000.00 when he had furnished to the said proposed purchasers a 'certificate or abstract of title from which it shall appear that you (Ramm) can convey good title . . . , it being understood that at the time of such payment of $34,000.00 formal contract of sale is to be executed, the balance of the purchase price in consecutive annual installments of $3,500.00, with interest thereon at the rate of 6 per cent per annum, payable annually.'

"The above document was delivered to Ramm at said meeting. He read it and then stated that his wife would not sign the papers, and refused to proceed with the deal. Notwithstanding this turn in the negotiations, the Moores and the plaintiffs continued in their efforts to consummate the sale, and, to that end, endeavored on different occasions, without avail, to persuade Ramm to complete the transaction upon the terms and conditions upon which he had authorized plaintiffs to sell the properties.

"Green, the attorney above spoken of, testified and corroborated in all important particulars Newton's testimony, from which the above statement of the facts is taken. Jan. 1927.] RUSSELL v. RAMM. 365

"Fred H. Moore, one of the proposed purchasers, testified that he and his brother, the other proposed purchaser, had sufficient financial means with which to carry out the deal according to the terms and conditions upon which the plaintiffs were authorized to negotiate the sale of the properties and as specified in the written offer by the Moores to purchase the same.

"It was not shown, or any attempt made to show that, at any time during the negotiations between plaintiffs and Ramm or between the former, the latter and the Moores that the name of Mrs. Ramm was ever mentioned in connection with the proposed sale, nor was it shown, or any attempt made to show, that she was ever at any time requested to sign any papers in connection with the transaction. There is no testimony that Ramm objected to the form of the offer or the terms and conditions as set forth in the proposed agreement or offer by the Moores to purchase the properties, the only objection to proceeding with the transaction being, as shown, that his wife had stated she would refuse to sign any papers or documents looking to the consummation of the sale.

"The above recital of the facts as they were disclosed by the testimony presented by the plaintiffs clearly confirms the statement heretofore made that the finding that the plaintiffs procured purchasers of the properties willing, ready and able to purchase the same is evidently well supported. There is no conflict in the evidence upon the vital facts essential to the support of the findings and the judgment in an action of this character. The testimony is not inherently improbable, or, upon its face, characterized by an intrinsic weakness which would justify this court in passing upon the weight thereof. The solution of that question was, therefore, the sole function of the court, it having been selected to try the questions of fact. [5] The rule is too elemental and has been so often repeated in the decisions as to require the re-statement thereof that, even where the evidence addressed pro and con to the issue or issues is contradictory and there is thus produced therein a substantial conflict, the decision of the jury or trial court upon the facts is conclusive and binding upon the courts of review. For a much greater reason should this rule apply where, as here, 366 RUSSELL v. RAMM. [200 Cal.

the testimony is not inherently improbable, and, upon its face, is all one way and uncontradicted. The only ground upon which Ramm refused to carry out the proposition to sell the properties to the Moores was, not that the latter were not willing, ready and able to purchase the same, but solely because his wife refused to join him in the sale and execution of the contract of sale. As seen, there is no testimony showing or even remotely tending to show that the consent of Mrs. Ramm to the sale or the requirement that she should join her husband in the execution of the contract of sale, or any of the preliminary negotiations or writings relative to the sale, was an element or factor in the contract between plaintiffs and Ramm whereby the former were authorized to find a purchaser of the properties. [6] Where the owner of property refuses to sell to the purchaser procured by the broker upon any ground other than that of the inability of the proposed purchaser to purchase, the owner cannot, in an action against him by the broker for compensation, successfully set up such ground as a defense, unless the fact constituting that ground is included in the agreement between the owner and broker as one of the terms or conditions which must be met or complied with by the broker before he has earned or is entitled to compensation for his services. It follows that the fact that Ramm's wife refused to join her husband in the transfer of the properties to the Moores does not in the least affect or impair the right of the plaintiffs to the compensation which Ramm agreed to pay them for securing purchasers of the properties. [7] Indeed, it is the general rule that the refusal of the wife of the owner to join in the conveyance of the property to the proposed vendee does not, itself, in a case of this character, operate to deprive the broker of his right to compensation. (See *Justy v. Erro*, 16 Cal. App. 519, 522 [117 Pac. 575], and cases therein cited; *Farrington v. McClellan*, 26 Cal. App. 375, 383 [146 Pac. 1051]; *Goodrich v. Turney*, 44 Cal. App. 516 [186 Pac. 806]; *Johnson v. Krier*, 59 Cal. App. 330, 333 [210 Pac. 966]; *Freeman v. Creelman*, 60 Cal. App. 14, 22, 23 [212 Pac. 56].)

[8] "The contention that, because the Moores demanded, as a condition to the execution of the contract of sale, a Jan. 1927.] RUSSELL v. RAMM. 367

certificate of title to the real property from Ramm, their proposal to purchase did not constitute an unconditional offer to purchase the properties and that for that reason the plaintiffs failed to procure in said Moores purchasers willing, ready and able to buy said properties, is without merit. By the writing authorizing the plaintiffs to obtain purchasers of the properties Ramm expressly agreed to furnish to any proposed buyer a 'deed and abstract, or certificate of title, showing clear title in me to date.' It is argued that the provision in said writing means and was intended to bear no other meaning, that defendant agreed to furnish an abstract or certificate of title only when the deed was tendered and not before, or at the time the contract of sale was executed. We cannot, as above intimated, yield our assent to that construction of said provision. If, as all the parties here seem to assume, the proposed contract was one of sale of the properties, then the execution thereof, which means that the cash payments required to be made at the time of the execution of the contract on the purchase price were then and there to be made, would operate to consummate the sale, and, obviously, before the contract was executed, the purchasers would be entitled to receive from the defendant duly authenticated evidence of his title to the properties. Such a situation, indeed, would clearly come within the language of the provision as it is construed by counsel for defendant. And we can perceive no reason for holding that the provision was not intended as well to apply to a contract for the sale of the properties, since it does not expressly or definitely fix the occasion on which the certificate of title is to be furnished. But it is further insisted that there was a failure on the part of the Moores to offer to purchase 'upon the terms of the agreement,' in that they offered therein to pay 'cash down' on the first payment the sum of $34,000.00 only, whereas, the agreement authorizing plaintiffs to sell the property called for a cash payment of $35,000.00. The written proposal of the Moores to purchase the properties specifically set forth, as has above been pointed out, the offer to make the initial payment as follows: 'One thousand dollars, which we have posted with Russell & Newton, as a guaranty of good faith,' and '$34,000.00 additional, when you (Ramm) shall furnish 368 RUSSELL v. RAMM. [200 Cal.

certificate or abstract of title,' etc. Thus clearly and unambiguously an offer of the cash payment of $35,000.00 on the consummation of the sale, as called for by the agreement between Ramm and plaintiffs, was submitted by the Moores, and we are at a loss to understand why a contention that such offer was not submitted is here urged. Our conclusion, on this branch of the case, is that the offer submitted by the Moores to purchase the properties was in all respects in accord with the terms and conditions of the listing agreement, or, in other words, constituted a direct offer to purchase upon such terms and conditions.

[9] "Lastly, it is contended that the description of the real property as it is given in the listing contract or memorandum of agreement between plaintiffs and Ramm is so vague and ambiguous as to render uncertain the particular tract or tracts of land to which said agreement related. The answer to this contention is that which is given in each of the following comparatively recent cases dealing with a like contention: *Goodrich v. Turney*, 44 Cal. App. 516 [186 Pac. 806]; *California Packing Corp. v. Grove*, 51 Cal. App. 253 [196 Pac. 891]; *Tolosano v. Will*, 62 Cal. App. 622 [217 Pac. 803]. The cases of *Goodrich v. Turney* and *Tolosano v. Will* involved actions by brokers for the recovery of compensation for procuring purchasers of land owned by the defendants. The Packing Corporation case was an action to recover an amount alleged to be due from defendant for his failure to deliver certain fruit in pursuance of the terms of a written contract. In the case of *Turney v. Goodrich*, the description of the land proposed to be exchanged by defendant for land owned by another party was as follows: 'An undivided one-half interest in Lots 423 and 424 of Fairmead Colony Tract No. 3, in Madera County, as a tenant in common with his wife.' In *California Packing Corporation v. Grove* the description was: 'The following orchards and lands leased or owned by the seller in the County of . . . . , State of California, to-wit: Located ¾ miles southeast of Visalia. . . . . Acres, 10, Present age, 6, Varieties of fruit, Tuscan peaches. Acres, 10, Present age, 6, Varieties of fruit, Phillips peaches.' In the case of *Tolosano v. Will* the property was described, as is stated in the opinion, 'as 40 acres located 12 miles West of Fresno; also, that 26 acres of Jan. 1927.] RUSSELL v. RAMM. 369

said land are planted to Thompson grapes, four years old, and 4 acres to alfalfa; that there is situated upon the property a house of three rooms, a barn, a tank house, a windmill and an "electric plant." The number of sweat boxes, picking boxes, horses, farming tools and implements upon the premises were also stated.' These descriptions were held to be sufficient in written instruments involving transactions of the character of the one here or in executory contracts relating to the transfer of real property, and in none of them was the description of the real property more definite than that of the real property in the listing card in this case. Furthermore, it appears without contradiction in this case that one of the plaintiffs here, prior to the preparation of the listing card, or the signing of any agreement or authorization by Ramm, visited the premises in question and that the latter pointed out to him the precise real and personal property which he desired to put in the hands of plaintiffs to be sold. It further likewise appears that one of the Moores, before offering to purchase the properties, visited the premises and that Ramm not only showed him the real property which he had employed plaintiffs to secure a purchaser for, but also called his attention to the specific articles of personal property which were to be included in and go with the sale. It was not shown or pretended at the trial that Ramm owned any other real property situated one mile north of and from Dinuba. Moreover, the amended complaint, as we have seen, purports to describe the real property by township, range and sectional subdivision, and the same is admitted to be correct by the failure of the answer to controvert it either generally or specifically. From all these considerations it is clear that nobody connected with the transaction was at any time misled or under any misapprehension or uncertainty as to the particular properties referred to in the listing card. It is the settled rule in this state 'as to particularity of description required in executory contracts to convey is extremely liberal in favor of their sufficiency. The rule is that where the description, so far as it goes, is consistent, but does not appear to be complete, it may be completed by extrinsic parol evidence, provided a new description is not introduced into the body of the contract, and the complaint must contain the averments of such

200 Cal.—24 370 RUSSELL v. RAMM. [200 Cal.

extrinsic matter as may be necessary to render the description complete.' (Marriner v. Dennison, 78 Cal. 202 [20 Pac. 386].)

"In MacKnight, Adm., etc., v. Davitt, 37 Cal. App. 720 [174 Pac. 77], in which the action was by a broker to recover commissions for negotiating the sale of certain lands, it is said:

"'Much greater liberality is allowed in construing and curing defective descriptions in brokers' contracts than in a deed of grant of land, for, so far as the statute of frauds is concerned, the terms of the employment are the essential part, and such contracts will not be declared void merely because of a defect, uncertainty or ambiguity in the description of the property to be sold or exchanged when such defect can be cured by the allegation or proof of extrinsic facts and circumstances.' (See Maze v. Gordon, 96 Cal. 61 [30 Pac. 962]; Proulx v. Sacramento Valley etc. Co., 19 Cal. App. 529, 534 [126 Pac. 509].)

[10] "Some suggestion is made in the briefs as to the insufficiency of the written memorandum of agreement to meet the requirements of the statute of frauds in such cases. The reply to any such suggestion is that the statute of frauds is not set up by the defendant, the rule being that in order that the defendant in any case may avail himself of the benefit of said statute, where it does not appear from the face of the complaint that the statute has not been complied with, it is necessary that it should be pleaded and proved. Furthermore, in this case the execution of the written memorandum was not denied and was introduced in evidence without any attempt to impeach it upon any ground. (Alaska Salmon Co. v. Standard Box Co., 158 Cal. 567 [112 Pac. 454]; Broder v. Conklin, 77 Cal. 330 [19 Pac. 513].)"

The judgment is affirmed.

Shenk, J., Seawell, J., Curtis, J., Preston, J., and Langdon, J., concurred.

WASTE, C. J.—I dissent. The respondents herein instituted this action in the superior court of Fresno County against Charles H. Ramm, deceased, to recover commissions in the sum of $3,250 alleged to have been earned by them as Jan. 1927.] RUSSELL v. RAMM. 371

real estate brokers. Trial was had before the court without a jury and judgment was entered in favor of said respondents as prayed for.

It appears that on January 5, 1920, the appellant's intestate authorized the respondents in writing to sell a tract of sixty acres of land situate in Tulare County, with the personal property thereon, for the sum of $120,000. Said written authorization provided that $35,000 of said purchase price was to be paid by the purchaser in cash and the remaining $85,000 was to be liquidated at the rate of $3,500 per annum with interest at six per cent. The commissions to be received by the respondents in the event a sale was consummated were also provided for in the authorization of sale.

On this appeal it is contended by the appellant, among other things, that the respondents failed to produce a purchaser or purchasers "ready, able and willing" to buy the property on the terms fixed by the owner. The respondents, on the other hand, urge that the purchasers procured by them were "ready, able and willing" to purchase the property on the terms specified but that the appellant's intestate refused to convey to said purchasers.

The rule is that to entitle a broker to commissions under a contract or written authorization of the character of that here involved and where, as here, no sale has been actually consummated, it is incumbent on him to prove that he found a purchaser or purchasers not only ready and willing but also able to buy the property on the terms prescribed by the owner. (Merzoian v. Kludjian, 183 Cal. 422 [191 Pac. 673]; Mattingly v. Pennie, 105 Cal. 514 [45 Am. St. Rep. 87, 39 Pac. 200]; Tashjian v. Krikorian, 55 Cal. App. 160 [202 Pac. 956].) It follows, therefore, that the respondents' right of recovery is dependent upon their having procured a purchaser able to buy the property on the terms fixed by the owner.

All of the evidence touching upon the financial ability of the purchasers found by the respondents was given by Fred W. Moore, who testified that he and his brother, H. H. Moore, had signed a written offer wherein and whereby they had agreed to purchase the tract of land then owned by appellant's intestate for the sum of $120,000, of which amount 372 RUSSELL v. RAMM. [200 Cal.

$35,000 was to be paid in cash; that he had sufficient money in the bank against which a check for $1,000 given by him to the respondents as a deposit might be drawn; that he "was able to buy it and go through with all my obligations"; that he and his brother were "buying it together"; that they were able to pay for the property; that he, the witness, had "considerable" property. On cross-examination the witness testified that he and his brother were "able to raise" the $34,000 required to complete the initial cash payment; that they "had considerable of it in the bank"; that he had about $15,000 in the bank but that he did not know "what my brother had but we were able to take care of the deal"; that he would not be required to raise the $34,000 necessary to complete the initial cash payment as he "knew my brother would take care of half of it, his half of it"; that he did not intend or expect "to take care of more than half"; that they had "everything arranged to take care of the deal"; that he did not "remember" just how he was to raise the $2,500 needed to complete his half of the initial cash payment; that he was going to borrow said amount from "somebody" and give his note therefor; that he did not "remember just how he was figuring on raising it now."

The cases passing upon what constitutes ability to pay on the part of a proposed purchaser involve such a variety of circumstances that it is difficult to deduce any fixed rule from them. It is my opinion, however, that the evidence set forth in narrative form above is insufficient to support the findings and judgment in favor of respondents. In other words, the respondents have failed to satisfy the burden resting upon them of proving that they had produced a purchaser or purchasers having the ability to buy the property upon the terms fixed by the owner.

The evidence clearly establishes that the witness, Fred W. Moore, intended and expected only to furnish one-half of the purchase price of $120,000 and but one-half of the initial cash payment of $35,000. Assuming, without deciding, that the evidence sufficiently shows that said witness was financially able to care for and pay his one-half of the purchase price and initial cash payment, there still remains a hiatus in the chain of proof, for there is an utter lack of Jan. 1927.] RUSSELL v. RAMM. 373

evidence tending to show or establish that the witness' brother, H. H. Moore, was financially able to care for and discharge his one-half of the obligation in the event a sale was consummated.

The law will not presume the existence of the purchaser's financial ability; the burden is upon the broker to establish that fact. It is declared in *Merzoian v. Kludjian*, supra, that "it was a part of plaintiff's case in chief to show that the purchaser was ready, able and willing to make the purchase, and this could be done by proof either that he had funds in hand, in whole or in part, or that he commanded resources upon which he could obtain the requisite credit." (Italics added.) The statement of the witness, Fred W. Moore, that he and his brother "were able to take care of the deal" was but the expression of an opinion on the part of said witness, and is too indefinite and conjectural to satisfy the burden resting upon the respondents or to establish the ability of H. H. Moore to proceed with the consummation of the sale so far as he personally was concerned. As already indicated, there is an absence of evidence tending to show the financial ability of said H. H. Moore, for the witness, Fred W. Moore, stated he did not know the nature or extent of his brother's assets. The evidence adduced is also insufficient to establish the ability of the witness, Fred W. Moore, to care for and discharge the entire financial burden in the event a sale was consummated. His testimony merely reveals that he had approximately $15,000 on deposit in a bank and "considerable" property. As declared in *Merzoian v. Kludjian*, supra, "he did not state whether he could have borrowed money on that property" nor is his testimony "at all certain as to his available assets." The witness, in fact, testified that he did not "remember" how and where he was to secure the nominal sum of $2,500 needed to complete and discharge his one-half of the initial cash payment. This being so, it may not reasonably be inferred that he was in a position to pay the entire initial cash payment or to discharge the full purchase price in the event a sale was consummated. Moreover, his testimony to the effect that he would have borrowed said $2,500 from "somebody" lends no support to a supposition that he might have borrowed sufficient to discharge the entire initial payment in the 374 WAYBRIGHT v. ANDERSON. [200 Cal.

event of a sale, for the authorities in this state uniformly hold that a statement of the proposed purchaser evincing a confidence in his ability to borrow the money "from someone, without showing that there was anyone legally bound to loan him this money, is insufficient to establish his financial ability to make the purchase." (*Tashjian v. Kirkorian, supra.*)

The evidence in the instant case when considered in a light most favorable to the respondents is insufficient to establish that the purchasers produced by them were "ready, *able* and willing" to complete the sale.

Rehearing denied.

Arvin B. Shaw, Jr., and I. W. Stewart for Appellants.

Moote & Patterson for Respondents.

THE COURT.—The above-named appellants have prosecuted appeals from two orders of the superior court of the county of Los Angeles setting aside and vacating judgments of dismissal entered against the plaintiffs in two actions involving the same parties. A stipulation that the two appeals may be consolidated and considered upon one set of briefs is on file herein.

The first of said actions was instituted on June 5, 1924, and is founded upon an alleged extortion. On the following day a second action was commenced and had for its purpose the recovery of a treble penalty. A demurrer to each of said complaints was interposed and sustained on the ground of defect of parties plaintiff. The time within which the plaintiffs might amend their complaints expired on August 4, 1924, without their having so amended. Thereafter and on August 12, 1924, a judgment of dismissal was entered in each of said actions on motion of the defendants. On the next succeeding day the plaintiffs attempted to serve their amended complaints and were thereupon for the first time informed of the entry of the judgments of dismissal. Subsequently, and on September 10, 1924, the plaintiffs served and filed in each action a notice of motion to set aside the judgment theretofore entered therein. An affidavit of counsel and a copy of an unverified amended complaint accompanied each notice of motion. On October 1, 1924, and before final hearing on said applications, the plaintiffs served and filed in each action a new notice of motion to vacate and attached thereto copies of new and verified amended complaints. A hearing on each of said applications was had on October 8, 1924, at which time the judgments of dismissal were set aside by the trial court and the verified amended complaints ordered filed. As already indicated, it is from the orders setting aside the judgments of dismissal that the appellants have appealed. Feb. 1927.] WAYBRIGHT v. ANDERSON. 377

[1] Preliminary to a consideration of the propriety of the trial court's action in the instant cases it may be stated that the authorities uniformly declare that a motion to set aside a default judgment is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court and in the absence of a clear showing of abuse in the exercise thereof an appellate court will not disturb the order of the court below. (Downing v. Klondike Min. Co., 165 Cal. 786, 788 [134 Pac. 970]; Alferitz v. Cahen, 145 Cal. 397, 398 [78 Pac. 878]; O'Brien v. Leach, 139 Cal. 220 [96 Am. St. Rep. 105, 72 Pac. 1004]; McGowan v. Kreling, 117 Cal. 31, 35 [48 Pac. 980]; Harbaugh v. Honey Lake Val. L. & W. Co., 109 Cal. 70, 72 [41 Pac. 792]; Sampanes v. Chazes, 54 Cal. App. 612, 613 [202 Pac. 462]; Porter v. Bryson, 35 Cal. App. 688, 690 [170 Pac. 1068]; Watson v. Columbia Basin Dev. Co., 22 Cal. App. 556, 561 [135 Pac. 511].)

[2] Moreover, it is the policy of the law to favor, wherever possible, a hearing on the merits and appellate courts are "much more disposed to affirm an order when the result is to compel a trial upon the merits than it is when the judgment by default is allowed to stand, and it appears that a substantial defense could be made." (O'Brien v. Leach, supra; Downing v. Klondike Min. Co., supra; Porter v. Bryson, supra.) This is clearly indicated in the case of Berri v. Rogero, 168 Cal. 736, 740 [145 Pac. 95, 97], wherein it is stated that "The policy of the law is to have every litigated case tried upon its merits, and it looks with disfavor upon a party who, regardless of the merits of his case, attempts to take advantage of the mistake, surprise, inadvertence, or neglect of his adversary. . . . A broad discretion is allowed to courts in granting relief, against default, and it is in cases only where the lower court has abused its discretion that the appellate court will reverse its action."

[3] Section 473 of the Code of Civil Procedure is a remedial provision and is to be liberally construed so as to dispose of cases upon their substantial merits, and to give to the party claiming in good faith to have a subsisting cause of action or a substantial defense thereto an opportunity to present it. It is for this reason that appellate courts more readily listen to an appeal from an order refusing to set aside default than where the motion has been 378 WAYBRIGHT v. ANDERSON. [200 Cal.

granted, since in such case the defaulting party may be deprived of a substantial right. (Nicoll v. Weldon, 130 Cal. 666 [63 Pac. 63].)

[4] The affidavits of counsel presented to the trial court upon the hearing of the applications herein show that a telephone conversation was had between opposing counsel at a time subsequent to the expiration of the period within which the plaintiffs were to have amended their complaints; that a verbal stipulation or understanding of some sort was entered into whereby the plaintiffs were to be permitted to thereafter file their amended complaints; and that there was a misunderstanding or divergence of opinion between counsel as to the effect of their verbal stipulation. Respondents' counsel in his affidavit in support of the motions to vacate asserts, in part, that he "felt absolutely assured the filing of the amended complaint upon any day that it might be ready would be satisfactory to the defendant. Absolutely no statement was made by Mr. Shaw [counsel for appellants] to the effect that it would have to be filed on any day certain or that default would be taken. If such had been our understanding, a written stipulation would have been obtained, a court order extending our time secured or the pleading would have been duly filed. . . . The defendants' attorneys did not notify us of their intention to disregard our verbal stipulation or inform us that our default would be taken if said complaint was not in within a given period of time. Our office had at all times acted upon and relied upon such verbal understanding in good faith." The counter-affidavit of appellants' counsel states, in part, that in their telephone conversation respondents' counsel said "he would see to it that said amended complaint was served and filed by Friday, August 8, 1924, to which affiant responded 'all right.' That said Mr. Patterson [counsel for respondents] did not state that 'the amended complaint would be served and filed in a few days,' or at any indefinite time, and affiant did not say to him, in words or in substance, nor did affiant orally or otherwise stipulate that plaintiffs' attorneys might have an indefinite or uncertain time, or such time as they desired, or any other time than up to and including said Friday, within which to serve and file said amended complaint." Feb. 1927.] WAYBRIGHT v. ANDERSON. 379

As indicated in the affidavit of respondents' counsel, he interpreted the agreement with opposing counsel as leaving the date or time open within which amended complaints might be served and filed and he further believed that judgments of default or dismissal would not be entered in the interim. In our opinion, this belief was not under the circumstances unreasonable, and "it is his belief and the reasonableness thereof that controls the question." (*Savings Bank v. Schell*, 142 Cal. 505 [76 Pac. 250].) The decision of the court below is conclusive on appeal in so far as the affidavits of counsel are in conflict. (*Savings Bank v. Schell*, supra.) That an appellate court would have upon the same showing reached a conclusion opposed to that of the trial court is not indicative of an abuse of discretion upon the part of said lower court. (*Alferitz v. Cahen*, supra.)

[5] We are familiar with the general rule that a stipulation of counsel cannot be enforced unless put in writing, or entered in the minutes of the court (sec. 283, Code Civ. Proc.), but the courts have been indisposed to give this otherwise general rule application to default judgments. (*McGowan v. Kreling*, supra; *Johnson v. Sweeney*, 95 Cal. 304, 306 [30 Pac. 540]; *McGillivray v. Owen*, 30 Cal. App. 763, 765 [159 Pac. 452].) Under the circumstances presented herein, the neglect or delay of respondents' counsel—for it would not have been neglect if his belief in the effect of the verbal stipulation had been well founded—was excusable, within the meaning of the statute which requires a default to be set aside where the same was taken through the excusable neglect of a party. In so declaring we are not unmindful that appellants urge that "the law requires the excuses for negligence to be shown." Aside from our opinion that the affidavits filed herein sufficiently explain and excuse the respondents' delay in pleading, it may be said that "in view of the settled disposition of the appellate courts in viewing the action taken under section 473 of the Code of Civil Procedure . . . the question is rather as to whether the affidavits show that the mistake was inexcusable, and that we are not prepared to hold." (*Porter v. Bryson*, supra.)

The order of a trial court vacating a default judgment has been sustained on appeal where the failure to season- 380 WAYBRIGHT v. ANDERSON. [200 Cal.

ably plead resulted from an erroneous office filing by counsel (Downing v. Klondike Min. Co., supra); also where counsel erroneously assumed service of summons had been had in the county wherein his client resided (O'Brien v. Leach, supra); and where counsel made entry of a wrong date of trial in his diary (Hagenkamp v. Equitable L. Assur. Soc., 29 Cal. App. 713, 717 [156 Pac. 520]). These authorities sufficiently illustrate that in the absence of a clear showing of abuse in the exercise of its discretion the order of the lower court setting aside a default will not be disturbed on appeal. There has been no showing herein that the court below abused its discretion.

[6] What has been said adequately disposes of the first two contentions urged by the appellants on this appeal. As a third contention it is asserted that "no proper showing of merits was made." It is true that affidavits of merits were not filed herein, but under the doctrine of Sampanes v. Chazes, supra, the service and filing of verified amended complaints rendered unnecessary the presentation and filing of affidavits of merits. We are not prepared to hold that said verified amended complaints fail to state causes of action, as urged by the appellants, for this question is primarily one to be decided by the trial court.

[7] Nor can we agree with the appellants' final contention that respondents' applications to set aside the judgments of dismissal were not made within a reasonable time. The entry of the default in each action was brought to the knowledge of respondents' counsel on August 13, 1924, whereupon he served and filed notices of motion to vacate the same on September 10, 1924, and made application in open court on September 22, 1924. Under the provisions of section 473 of the Code of Civil Procedure, a motion to vacate and set aside a judgment must be presented within a "reasonable time" not exceeding six months. The applications herein were, in our opinion, seasonably made.

For the foregoing reasons the orders appealed from are affirmed. Feb. 1927.] PENGELLY v. PENGELLY. 381

Joseph A. Brown for Appellant.

Timothy Healy for Respondent.

THE COURT.—This appeal was placed upon a special calendar of this court upon an order to the respondent to show cause why the judgment herein should not be reversed, or that such order be made as might be meet in the premises. At the time of the placing of said cause upon said calendar, and the entry of said order, it appeared that the appellant's brief had been filed herein, but that no brief on behalf of the respondent had been filed, although the time for the filing of such brief under the rules of this court had long since expired. It appears that the appeal is from an order of the superior court in and for the city and county of San Francisco modifying the interlocutory and final decrees of divorce entered in the above-entitled action. The custody of the minor child of the parties was awarded to the plaintiff under said interlocutory 382 HUNT, MIRK & CO., INC., v. HESPERIDES MIN. CO. [200 Cal.

and final decrees. Thereafter and on October 30, 1923, the modifying order appealed from was made and entered. This latter order provided that the custody of said minor child be in the defendant for the period from November 1, 1923, to April 30, 1924. [1] It appears upon the face of the order complained of that the custody of said minor, theretofore exclusively in the plaintiff, was to be given to the defendant only for the six months' period designated therein and for no other period of time. Aside from the fact that the child has now reached an age when he might properly select his own guardian, an examination of the appellant's brief and the record reveals that the period of time within which the transfer of custody was to take place has long since passed by and the question presented herein has therefore become moot. Furthermore, such examination discloses that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in thus ordering a temporary transfer of custody of said minor and the appeal is, therefore, entirely without merit and is a frivolous appeal.

It is ordered that the appeal be and the same is hereby dismissed.

E. D. Knight for Appellant.

D. P. Eicke, Frank G. Warren, William Grant and J. B. Zimdars for Respondent.

THE COURT.—This appeal was placed upon a special calendar of this court upon an order to the respondent to show cause why the judgment herein should not be reversed, or that such order be made as might be meet in the premises. At the time of the placing of said cause upon said calendar, and the entry of said order, it appeared that the appellant's brief had been filed herein, but that no brief on behalf of the respondent had been filed, although the time for the filing of such brief under the rules of this court had long since expired. The appeal herein is from an order of the superior court in and for the city and county of San Francisco setting aside and vacating a default judgment theretofore entered in the above-entitled action against the defendant Hesperides Mining Company, a corporation. An examination of the record reveals that the clerk of said superior court duly entered the default of the Hesperides Mining Company on June 19, 1922, for failure to appear and plead within the time allowed by law. Thereafter and on November 9, 1923, the default of the other defendant, H. B. Patterson, was likewise and for the same reasons entered by said clerk. On the same day a judgment of default was entered by said superior court as against both defendants. Subsequently and on January 4, 1924, the defendant Hesperides Mining Company filed a notice of motion to vacate and set aside the default judgment theretofore entered against it. This notice, though inartificially worded, may be interpreted to indicate that said motion would be made under and pursuant to the provisions of section 473 of the Code of Civil Procedure. On February 4, 1924, the motion to vacate and set aside the default judgment entered against said defendant Hesperides Mining Company was made in open court, and, after submission, was granted on the following day. This appeal was thereupon taken. 384 PETER R. GADD, INC., v. WORKMAN. [200 Cal.

[1] The appellant's contention touching the asserted abuse in the discretion exercised by the trial court is without merit. However, under the provisions of section 473 of the Code of Civil Procedure, a motion or application to vacate and set aside a default on the grounds therein enumerated must be made within a "reasonable time" not exceeding six months. The authorities declare that "the clerk's entry of the default, and not the entry of the judgment by the court, fixes the beginning of the six months within which the application must be made." (*McLain v. Llewellyn Iron Works*, 56 Cal. App. 58, 59 [204 Pac. 869]; *Mader v. Christie*, 52 Cal. App. 138, 141 [198 Pac. 45]; *Title Ins. Co. v. King Co.*, 162 Cal. 44, 46 [120 Pac. 1066].) It is readily apparent from the above chronological statement of the case that the application to vacate and set aside the judgment entered herein was made approximately twenty months after entry by the clerk of the respondent's default, and, therefore, not within the time prescribed by law.

For the foregoing reasons the order appealed from is hereby reversed.

Redwine & Redwine and Andrew Park, *Amici Curiae*, in Behalf of Respondents.

RICHARDS, J.—The petitioner herein has applied for a writ of mandate wherein it seeks to compel the respondents, the city council of the city of Los Angeles and the members thereof, to confirm a certain assessment made in the course of a certain street improvement proceeding within what is known as the Adams Street and Smiley Drive Improvement District, which improvement had been initiated and thus far carried forward under and in pursuance of the "Improvement Act of 1911" [Stats. 1911, p. 730], and its subsequent supplementary or amendatory enactments. Said public improvement had been initiated through the adoption by the respondents of an ordinance of intention on the fifteenth day of May, 1925, and had proceeded thereunder up to the time when the assessment therefor had been filed with the city clerk and the notice to property owners required by said original and amendatory acts had been given by said official, fixing the twelfth day of July, 1926, as the time when property owners would be heard before said city council upon their appeals from said assessment and objections to the confirmation thereof. The regularity of the proceedings thus far taken in the course of the progress of said improvement and in the levy of said assessment is not an issue in the proceeding before us, since the petitioner herein is here insisting that the re-

200 Cal.—25 386 PETER R. GADD, INC., v. WORKMAN. [200 Cal.

spondents by their action in denying the appeals of the property owners at the hearing upon said last-named date have thereby confirmed said assessment, and hence of necessity the regularity of the proceedings upon which it was predicated. The respondents are not here making any contention as to the irregularity of the proceedings upon which said assessment was based, but only that the regularity and legality of said assessment has not yet been finally determined. [1] The sole question presented upon the hearing herein relates to the action of said city council taken upon the hearing before it upon said last-named date with respect to the objections and appeals of the property owners then presented and to the finality of its action in that regard. Section 21 of the Improvement Act of 1911, as amended in 1923 [Stats. 1923, p. 113], provides for the making and filing with the city clerk by the street superintendent or city engineer of his assessment made in the course of the improvement in question, and provides for giving notice of the filing of such assessment by said official to all interested parties in order that those who feel themselves aggrieved by the burden of said assessment or by any errors or informalities in the proceeding upon which the same has been based may appeal to the city council by briefly stating in writing the grounds of their said appeal. At the time fixed in said notice for the hearing or hearings upon such appeals said section provides that the city council shall proceed to hear and determine the same. Said section further provides that "When no appeal is taken, or when the orders and determinations of the council upon appeal have been complied with, and the council is satisfied with the correctness of the assessment, thereupon the street superintendent shall attach thereto a warrant bearing date of said order of said city council." Pursuant to the provisions of said act said city council proceeded to hold the meeting provided for in said notice and to hear the appeals and objections of the property owners then or theretofore presented and filed. There were a large number of such appeals, wherein many and various reasons were presented by the respective property owners objecting to such assessment. The president of the city council instructed the clerk to proceed with the reading of these separate appeals, and as each appeal was read a hearing was had Feb. 1927.] PETER R. GADD, INC., v. WORKMAN. 387

thereon, and after each of such hearings a formal motion was made by one or another of the members of said city council that said appeal be denied, which motion was in each case adopted. The hearing upon these numerous and separate appeals occupied the morning session of the city council and also, after a brief recess, a considerable portion of the afternoon session of that body. The minutes of the meeting of the city council upon this occasion show that after each and all of said appeals had been separately heard, and after a formal motion had been made in each case denying the same, and "after a full and fair opportunity had been given to all persons desiring to be heard, the president stated that the matter was now before the council for its consideration." Thereupon, as the minutes show, the inspector of public works "was asked to address the council on the matter under consideration." The assistant city attorney also addressed the council and "a general discussion was thereupon entered into by all members of the council, and at the conclusion of the discussion Mr. Randall moved, seconded by Mr. Sparks, that action on the confirmation of assessment for the improvement of Adams between 13th avenue and Moynier lane, and portions of other streets, as contemplated by ordinance of intention No. 51862 N. S. be deferred until the meeting of the council to be held Tuesday, July 27, 1926, at the hour of 10:30 A. M., which motion was adopted by the following vote." The said meeting of the council then adjourned. At the meeting of the council held on July 27, 1926, as its minutes show, the further hearing and confirmation of assessment was continued until August 3, 1926, at which latter meeting counsel for the petitioner herein appeared and presented a written demand for the confirmation of the assessment, whereupon a motion was made and carried that further consideration upon the hearing and confirmation of said assessment be continued until August 10, 1926. The petition for a writ of mandate herein was filed in this court on August 2, 1926. It is the contention of the petitioner that the city council of Los Angeles by its action in formally moving and carrying a motion to deny each and every one of the appeals presented to and heard before it upon the twelfth day of July, 1926, has so far fulfilled the requirements of section 21 of the Improvement 388 PETER R. GADD, INC., v. WORKMAN. [200 Cal.

Act and its amendments above referred to as to have completely exercised its jurisdiction in that regard, and that having done so its determination of said appeals was so far final as to require the transmission of said assessment by said official body to the board of public works of the city of Los Angeles, together with a certificate showing its aforesaid action taken in the premises in the way of the denial by it of each and all of said appeals; and that such action on its part, being administrative in character, may be compelled by the mandate of this court. We are unable to agree with this contention, both for the reason that by the terms of section 21 of said Improvement Act as amended in 1923 and as above quoted the city council as a prerequisite to its final determination as to the validity and correctness of the assessment must be satisfied therewith whether or not appeals have been taken, and hence of necessity must be entitled to hold the matter of the approval of such assessment under investigation and consideration until it shall have been so satisfied; and for the further reason that the undisputed record embraced in the official minutes of the city council discloses that at and in the course of its meeting upon the above date, and as an immediate part of its consideration of the very matter then before it, the council did determine, notwithstanding its action upon the appeals which were then presented and heard, to give such further consideration to the matter of the validity and correctness of said assessment as might lead to a later determination of its satisfaction with the same and to the propriety of transmitting to the board of public works said assessment with the official certificate of its approval thereof. The minutes of the city council, when read as a whole, clearly point to this and to no other conclusion. The cases cited by the petitioner as supporting its contention as to the finality of the action of the city council in the denial of the appeals presented before it do not support its present insistence as to the finality of the action of the council in denying said appeals, since in each of the cases cited it is made to appear that the action of the official body upon said appeals and upon the validity of the assessment in each case was completed at the time and meeting at which such action was taken, and that it was some later attempt to reassume a jurisdiction Feb. 1927.] FIRST NAT. BANK OF OAKDALE v. BRASHEAR. 389

which had been thus completely exercised which led to the proceedings and ruling in each of said cases. In the instant case, however, we are clearly of the opinion that the jurisdiction with which the city council was invested by the terms of section 21 of the Improvement Act above quoted had not been fully exercised when this proceeding was instituted and, so far as the record herein discloses, has not yet been so exercised.

It follows necessarily that the petition for a writ of mandate herein must be denied and it is so ordered.

# THE FIRST NATIONAL BANK OF OAKDALE, Appellant, v. E. E. BRASHEAR et al., Respondents.

[1] CHATTEL MORTGAGES—LEASED LAND—SURRENDER OF LEASE—WHEN MORTGAGE NOT LIEN ON CROPS.—Where a sublessee of agricultural land, during his occupancy of the land, executes a chattel mortgage upon the crops to be grown thereon, but after summer-fallowing the land surrenders his sublease without planting any crops, the mortgage does not attach to crops afterward planted by a new tenant.

[2] Id.—CROP MORTGAGE—EFFECT OF.—While a crop mortgage may be made to cover crops thereafter to be sown and grown upon leased land, and such a mortgage has a potential existence during the period prior to the actual planting of the seed, such mortgage does not pass the point of potential existence prior to the actual planting of the land.

[3] Id.—INTEREST OF MORTGAGEE—LIEN.—The general rule is that the holder of a crop mortgage has no interest in nor lien upon the land, but the lien of such mortgage attaches only to the interest which the mortgagor may have in the crops after they have come into being by the planting of the seed wherefrom they are grown.

T. B. Scott, W. H. Hatton, Vernon F. Gant and Thomas M. Anaya for Respondents.

RICHARDS, J.—This appeal is prosecuted by the plaintiff in an action wherein the latter sought to foreclose a chattel mortgage which had been executed to it by the defendants E. E. Brashear and Marie Brashear on October 22, 1921, to secure a promissory note for the principal sum of $6,300, also then executed, and which note provided for interest and future advances. The mortgage in question was in form a crop mortgage, by the terms of which the Brashears mortgaged to the plaintiff the crops growing and to be grown during a series of succeeding years upon a certain tract of land consisting of 1,000 acres which had been subleased to said E. E. Brashear during the year 1920 by two certain parties named Collins and Cathey, who were, in Feb. 1927.] FIRST NAT. BANK OF OAKDALE v. BRASHEAR. 391

turn, the lessees of a much larger tract of land, which embraced the above acreage, from the Turlock Irrigation District, the owner thereof. The sublease to E. E. Brashear provided that the latter should summer-fallow at least 300 acres of said subleased land each year and that in the event of his failure so to do his lease should become null and void. It was while he was the holder of said sublease that E. E. Brashear and his wife executed and delivered to the plaintiff the note and mortgage above mentioned, and which mortgage purported to cover two-thirds of the crops grown and to be grown upon said land. In July, 1920, said Collins and Cathey assigned their lease of the larger tract to one J. T. Denton, and upon the date thereof the irrigation district executed a new lease to Denton covering the same property for a lengthened term of years and at a reduced rental. Upon the same date Denton executed a new sublease to Brashear for the remainder of the term covered by his former lease and containing the same clause relative to summer-fallowing during the term thereof of 300 acres of the subleased land. During the spring of the year 1922 and while the defendant E. E. Brashear and his wife were in possession of the premises thus subleased he proceeded to summer-fallow approximately 400 acres of said land preparatory to planting the same with grain during the proper planting season of that or the following year. After having done so, and being apparently much involved financially, Brashear applied to the plaintiff for further credit; which application being rather coldly received Brashear concluded to surrender his sublease to his immediate landlord Denton and abandon the premises, and he accordingly on or about September 21, 1922, executed and caused to be recorded a formal surrender of said sublease to said Denton, and shortly thereafter Brashear and his wife abandoned said premises and went to live elsewhere. Thereupon said Denton went into possession of the premises thus surrendered and abandoned and subsequently thereto and on October 22, 1922, made and entered into an agreement with the defendant Huddleson, which agreement was in the form of a cropping lease covering about 360 acres of said 1,000-acre tract, wherein it was provided that said Huddleson was to plant and cultivate a crop or crops of grain upon said land which had thereto- 392 FIRST NAT. BANK OF OAKDALE V. BRASHEAR. [200 Cal.

fore been summer-fallowed, and was upon the harvesting thereof to deliver to Denton one-fourth of the crops thus sown and harvested. Huddleson, under this agreement, went into the possession of said 360 acres of land and proceeded to plant, cultivate, and harvest a crop of grain thereon, while Denton proceeded to plant and harvest a crop of grain upon some 50 acres of said already summer-fallowed land of which he retained possession. In August, 1923, while the crops so seeded and cultivated by defendants Huddleson and Denton were in process of being harvested, the plaintiff herein commenced this action, making Brashear and his wife and also Denton and Huddleson defendants therein, seeking to foreclose its aforesaid crop mortgage upon the crops thus grown upon said land. A receiver was appointed in said action, who took possession of the crops and harvested and sold the same under order of said court and deposited the proceeds of such sale with the clerk of the court to await the outcome of said action. The case, when the issues were made up, was first brought to trial before a jury, but the trial court presently concluded that the action was equitable in its nature, and after discharging the jury proceeded to hear and determine the same. By its findings of fact and conclusions of law the trial court found and concluded that the plaintiff was entitled to judgment against E. E. Brashear and his wife upon their promissory note to it for the amount remaining due thereon, but that as to the crops and the proceeds thereof grown and harvested by Huddleson and Denton upon said premises the plaintiff was entitled to no relief. From the judgment which followed to the same effect the plaintiff has prosecuted the present appeal.

[1] The sole question presented to the court for consideration upon this appeal is as to whether or not the crop mortgage which had been given by the Brashears to the plaintiff had become so far effective upon the summer-fallowing work upon said premises which had been done by the Brashears in the spring of 1922 as to entitle the plaintiff to enforce its crop mortgage against the crops thereafter sown and grown upon said premises, when it appeared that the same had been sown and grown thereon after the surrender and abandonment of said premises and of his sublease thereof by said Brashear and when the Feb. 1927.] FIRST NAT. BANK OF OAKDALE v. BRASHEAR. 393

possession of said premises had been resumed by Denton and a new cropping agreement had been entered into as between himself and the defendant Huddleson, and when the latter, in pursuance thereof, had sown and grown the crops which were sought to be subjected to the lien of the plaintiff's said mortgage. It is the contention of the appellant that when the summer-fallowing of that portion of the said premises had been done by the Brashears a sufficiently decisive step had been taken in the direction of the planting and growing of the crop or crops of grain thereon as would suffice to entitle the plaintiff to assert the lien of its mortgage against such crops as were thereafter grown upon said summer-fallowed premises, even though the Brashears had surrendered the possession of said lands to their lessor, who had in turn executed a new cropping lease to the succeeding tenant Huddleson, by whom the crops sought to be subjected to said mortgage had been actually sown and grown. [2] We are unable to agree with this contention, for while it is true that a crop mortgage may be made to cover the crops thereafter to be sown and grown upon leased land, as was held by this court in the case of *Arques v. Wasson*, 51 Cal. 620 [21 Am. Rep. 718], and while it is true, as stated in that case, that such a mortgage has a potential existence during the period prior to the actual planting of the seed in said land upon which the crops to be subjected to said mortgage are to be grown, our attention has been called to no case, either in this or in any other jurisdiction, which goes so far as to hold that such a crop mortgage shall pass the point of such potential existence at any time prior to the actual planting with seed of said land. The rule applicable to this class of securities may seem to be an arbitrary one, but it has nevertheless been given universal application and has never, so far as we have been advised by the appellant or have investigated the authorities upon our own account, been extended to a case wherein the land, although plowed or summer-fallowed by the tenant, has passed, through his surrender of his lease back to his landlord or into the possession and control of others who have thereafter undertaken to plant and grow the crops thereon. The case of *Isbell v. Slette*, 52 Mont. 156 394 FIRST NAT. BANK OF OAKDALE V. BRASHEAR. [200 Cal.

[155 Pac. 503], presents a practically identical situation to the case at bar. The Montana statutes relating to crop mortgages are similar to our own. The supreme court of Montana, after citing the case of *Arques v. Wasson*, *supra*, proceeded to hold that the crop mortgage in that case could not be held to attach to the crops planted and grown upon the leased premises after the lessee had parted with his possession and leasehold interest therein. A similar ruling was made by the supreme court of Minnesota in the case of *Simmons v. Anderson*, 44 Minn. 487 [47 Pac. 52], and a like holding was made by the supreme court of Iowa in the case of *Gammon v. Bull*, 86 Iowa, 754 [53 N. W. 340], [3] The text-writers recognize and state the general rule to be that the holder of a crop mortgage has no interest in or lien upon the land, but that the lien of such mortgage attaches only to the interest which the mortgagor may have in the crops after they have come into being by the planting of the seed wherefrom they are grown (6 Cyc., p. 1048; 11 Cor. Jur., at p. 444), in which latter authority the foregoing cases from Montana and Minnesota are cited with approval.

[4] The appellant, however, further contends that the written and recorded surrender of his lease by Brashear was void for the reason that the writing evidencing such surrender was not signed by the wife of Brashear. The theory of the appellant in making this contention is apparently that the leasehold interest of said Brashear was community property which the husband could not transfer without the written consent of his wife. This contention has no merit for the reason that the lease of the premises by Brashear was executed by himself alone, his wife not joining therein, and that the same amounted in law merely to a chattel real with which the husband had full power to deal. [5] But even were it otherwise, the undisputed evidence disclosed that after such written surrender of his said lease by Brashear, both he and his wife abandoned said leasehold premises and their immediate landlord accepted such surrender and abandonment and resumed possession of the premises. All interest of the Brashears therein was thus terminated, and with such termination all rights of their mortgagee as to crops not yet planted Feb. 1927.] FIRST NAT. BANK OF OAKDALE v. BRASHEAR. 395

upon the premises came to an end under the authorities above referred to. It follows necessarily that the plaintiff retained no interest whatever in the premises or in the crops thereafter to be sown and grown thereon, and the trial court was not, accordingly, in error in holding that the plaintiff had no lien upon the crops planted upon said premises by the defendants Denton and Huddleson, and hence no right to receive any portion of the proceeds thereof which had resulted from the harvesting and sale of said crops by the receiver and the deposit of the proceeds thereof with the court to abide the result of the judgment in said action.

No appeal having been prosecuted from said judgment by the defendants E. E. and Marie Brashear as to that portion thereof which bound them to the payment of their promissory note to the plaintiff, it follows that said judgment as to the respondents Denton and Huddleson should be and the same is hereby affirmed.

John S. DeLancey and Clarence DeLancey for Appellants.

R. M. Wright and Fitzgerald, Abbott & Beardsley for Respondents.

PRESTON, J.—Plaintiffs own the northern one-half of lot 9, Alice Park Property, Oakland, California. Defendants own lot 10, adjoining. Plaintiffs claim the common boundary between said lots is located 1182.84 feet from the point of intersection of Twelfth and Harrison Streets; defendants contend it is located 1182 feet from the same point, and relying upon this contention caused to be erected upon their property a brick and tile garage building, which building Feb. 1927.] MCKEAN v. ALLIANCE LAND CO. 397

upon completion, according to the testimony of their own witness Mr. Prather, encroached beyond the boundary claimed by them a distance of from one-half to five-eighths of an inch.

Plaintiffs sued to enjoin defendants from depriving them of their property, being the said 84/100 of a foot, more or less, in dispute, and for abating said building as a nuisance; also for damages in amount of $5,000.

There is a conflict in the evidence. Clifford H. Boardman, an experienced surveyor, gave testimony in support of plaintiffs' contention. Plaintiffs also introduced certain old city ordinances in an effort to prove that subsequent to the filing for record of the map of Alice Park there had been a change made of about one foot in the monument line of Twelfth Street and certain old maps purporting to show a variation of one foot in the location of Twelfth Street. None of these exhibits show a difference of .84 of a foot and at most they appear to be but proof of inaccuracy in the surveys.

On the other hand, E. C. Prather, also an experienced surveyor, gave testimony fully supporting defendants' claim, and they further introduced evidence showing that every conveyance of lot 9 and lot 10 from 1868 to date of the trial gave the distance from Twelfth Street, or Fourteenth Street, in accordance with the filed map distance and as found by the court. Mr. Prather stated he had first surveyed the tract in question six years prior to the commencement of this action; that at the request of defendants he surveyed lot 10 in December, 1921, and again went over the survey after construction of the garage; that as his initial point he took the northerly line of Twelfth Street, as fixed by the city monuments, at its intersection with the easterly line of Harrison Street; that he found the distance along Harrison Street from said point to the point of intersection with the southerly line of lot 10 to be 1182 feet. This distance is corroborated by the map of Alice Park and is .84 of a foot less than the distance testified to by Mr. Boardman. It is conceded that Mr. Prather's survey is right, and Mr. Boardman's wrong, if the northerly line of Twelfth Street is located now where it was in 1868. In other words, it is a disputed question of fact as to whether the monument line of Twelfth Street was changed subsequent to 1868. Mr. 398 MCKEAN v. ALLIANCE LAND CO. [200 Cal.

Prather testified that he never knew it was changed. Counsel for appellants then asked him if he would say that it was not changed after the filing of the map of Alice Park property and objection to this question was sustained on the ground that it was not the proper way of showing a change of location of streets, not the best evidence, but a matter of opinion. From the record it appears that no convincing proof of such change was given.

Mr. Prather further testified that upon his survey after erection of the garage building he found it had been so constructed that it encroached on lot 9 half an inch at one end, increasing to five-eighths of an inch at the other.

The trial court found that the boundary line was, as claimed by defendants, 1182 feet from the above-described point of intersection, and found further that defendants' building encroached from one-half to five-eighths of an inch on plaintiffs' lot, by reason of which encroachment plaintiffs had been damaged in the sum of $10, and no more, and gave judgment accordingly.

On appeal plaintiffs complain: First, that the findings, and particularly finding number 4 placing the damage at $10, were not supported by the evidence or the facts; and second, that the judgment of the trial court awarded damages instead of requiring removal of the encroachment.

[1] It is well settled that where the evidence is contradictory, the findings of the trial court are conclusive. "The rule adverted to above, that the jury is ordinarily the sole judge of the weight of evidence and credibility of witnesses, applies with great force in a case of conflict. It is the duty of the trier of facts to reconcile, if possible, any apparent conflict, whether such conflict is developed upon the whole case or in the testimony of an individual witness, and to give effect to all the evidence, when the nature of the case will admit of such a disposition, or, if the conflict is irreconcilable, to affix their own value to the contradictory evidence. . . . It is a cardinal doctrine often enunciated, that where, upon a question of fact, the testimony in the court below involves a substantial conflict, the action of the court below will not be disturbed. It is to be presumed that the trial judge reconciled and accounted for to his own satisfaction any and all inconsistencies which might be made to appear in the testimony." (10 Cal. Jur., pp. 1171, 1172, sec. 382, Feb. 1927.] MCKEAN v. ALLIANCE LAND CO. 399

383, citing *Adkins v. Brett*, 184 Cal. 252 [193 Pac. 251]; *Welch v. Alcott*, 185 Cal. 731 [198 Pac. 626]; *People v. Weber*, 149 Cal. 325 [86 Pac. 671]; *Waer v. Waer*, 189 Cal. 178 [207 Pac. 891]; *Union C. Co. v. Madera etc. Irr. Co.*, 179 Cal. 774 [178 Pac. 957], and many other cases.)

On the question of awarding damages instead of ordering removal of the encroachment, we find *Rothaermel v. Amerige*, 55 Cal. App. 273 [203 Pac. 833], in point. There the foundation of defendant's building encroached 1½ inches on plaintiff's land. The circumstances were such that the foundation footings could not be removed without great inconvenience and damage. Ownership and possession of the disputed 1½ inches had been placed by a judgment of the court in plaintiff. The court awarded to plaintiff nominal damages of $1 for the withholding of the property by defendant. In the opinion the following citation from Ruling Case Law, volume 14, paragraphs 14–57, is quoted with approval: "It is also true, as a general rule that the court should not interfere by way of mandatory injunction . . . where the injury is so slight as to bring it within the maxim *de minimis*, or full compensation can be made in damages. If there is an adequate remedy at law, no relief will be granted, especially where there is no appreciable damage, and its issuance would require the performance of an act which would be difficult, and involve considerable expense."

[2] Here the correct boundary line is established protecting the rights of appellants. The court further specifically found that "a judgment for said sum of $10 is an adequate remedy for said damage and will afford said plaintiffs, and each of them, full, complete, and adequate relief." There was no direct evidence that the encroachment of from one-half to five-eighths of an inch caused any actual damage to plaintiffs, and to our mind the award of the trial court is both wise and just.

Judgment affirmed.

[1] ESTATES OF DECEASED PERSONS—HOLOGRAPHIC WILL—EXECUTION—EVIDENCE.—The signature to a holographic will, wherever it is placed in the will, is sufficient if it is evident from an inspection of the whole document itself that it was the intent of the testator it should serve as a token of execution; but it must appear from the face of the instrument that it is a complete and executed document.

WASTE, C. J.—Ynez Morgan died leaving an instrument testamentary in character. After a contest, the probate court found it to be a valid holographic will, entirely written, dated, and signed by the testatrix, and made its order admitting the document to probate as the last will and testament of the decedent. From that order this appeal is taken.

The purported will, made ten months prior to the death of the decedent, was found in her writing-desk among her papers. No signature appears at the end of the document, which is entirely in the handwriting of the decedent. The name, Ynez Morgan, appears twice in the instrument, and the only question before the court on this appeal is whether or not the decedent, by writing her name in either, or both, of said places, thereby "signed" the will. A photostatic copy of the document is here reproduced.

[Handwritten note: "Last will and testament of Ynez Morgan Feb. 21, 1925. I, Ynez Morgan, hereby will and be quett all that I possess in real and personal property to my cousins, Renette and Alma Prior. It is my wish that my aunt Mrs. G. G. Prior be executrix against bond.]

[1] This court has, upon a number of occasions very recently, been called upon to consider the nature of the evidence permissible and sufficient to establish the due execution of a holographic will, where the signing thereof by the testator is not in the customary place at the end of the instrument. The conclusion reached and adhered to in the decisions is that it must be established upon the face of the offered instrument that it is a complete and executed document; that notwithstanding that the usual place of signing,

200 Cal.—26 402 ESTATE OF MORGAN. [200 Cal.
and so of evidencing due execution and completeness, is at the end of the instrument, the signature of a testator found elsewhere than at the end may be, if circumstances warrant it, a signature of execution, but that the only evidence which will warrant this conclusion must be found in and on the instrument itself. (Estate of McMahon, 174 Cal. 423 [L. R. A. 1917D, 778, 163 Pac. 669].) As stated in another case: "The true rule, as we conceive it to be, is that, wherever placed, the fact that it was intended as an executing signature must satisfactorily appear on the face of the document itself. If it is at the end of the document, the universal custom of mankind forces the conclusion that it was appended as an execution, if nothing to the contrary appears. If placed elsewhere, it is for the court to say, from an inspection of the whole document, its language as well as its form, and the relative position of its parts, whether or not there is a positive and satisfactory inference from the document itself that the signature was so placed with the intent that it should there serve as a token of execution. If such inference thus appears, the execution may be considered as proven by such signature." (Estate of Manchester, 174 Cal. 417, 421 [Ann. Cas. 1918B, 227, L. R. A. 1917D, 629, 163 Pac. 358]; see, also, Estate of Streeton, 183 Cal. 284, 288 [191 Pac. 16]; Estate of Bernard, 197 Cal. 36, 38 [239 Pac. 404]; Estate of Devlin, 198 Cal. 721 [247 Pac. 577].)

The will here in question makes complete disposition of the property of the decedent, and designates the person who shall have charge of the administration of her estate. It in all respects appears to be a completed document, which removes it from one of the objections raised in Estate of Bernard, supra, and other cases. If the words "Last will and testament of Ynez Morgan" appeared at the end of the will, all doubt that the signature was intended to be and was adopted as the final executing signature in authentication of and in execution of the document as a completed testamentary act would be removed. Looking at the instrument as a whole, we are of the view that, by the use of these words in the beginning of the instrument, it was the inten- Feb. 1927.] WESSELS v. SUPERIOR COURT. 403

tion of the testatrix to thereby execute the document as a will.

So recently has this court discussed this question and reviewed the authorities that nothing further need be added. We are satisfied that the finding of the probate court to the effect that the testatrix duly authenticated and executed the instrument as her last will and testament is sustained by the inferences arising from an inspection of the document itself.

The order appealed from is affirmed.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Superior Court of Sacramento County and from an order denying new trial. John F. Pullen, Judge. Reversed.

The facts are stated in the opinion of the court.

Donald McKisick and J. S. Daly for Appellant.

U. S. Webb, Attorney-General, and J. Charles Jones, Deputy Attorney-General, for Respondent.

PRESTON, J.—Defendant was convicted by a jury in the superior court of Sacramento County of the crime of burglary. He petitions this court for a hearing after decision of the district court of appeal, third appellate district, on hearing and rehearing, affirming the judgment of conviction and order denying his motion for a new trial.

Appellant contends that the evidence is insufficient to support the verdict of conviction in that there was no testimony introduced by the People to support a conviction but that of an accomplice, uncorroborated by other testimony or evidence tending to connect the accused with the commission of the crime; also that the trial court erred in admitting hearsay testimony against the defendant; in submitting to the jury a special verdict as to whether the witness Speascock was an accomplice; in allowing the district attorney to misstate the law during his argument to the jury; and in giving instructions to the jury which were erroneous and prejudicial to the rights of defendant.

The facts are briefly: On February 1, 1926, between the hour of 8 P. M., when it was inspected and seals found intact, and the hour of 10:30 P. M., when it was scheduled for departure, car No. 2100 stationed in Haggins yards attached to a freight train and loaded with freight, including a crate of hams, was broken open and about one-half the hams contained in the crate were removed. Subsequently, one Daniel E. Speascock and later defendant and one Hudson were arrested and charged with commission of the offense. The information in the court below read in part as follows:

"The said Dewey Hudson, alias Roy Allen, Daniel E. Speascock and Bernard P. Allison on or about the 1st day 406 PEOPLE v. ALLISON. [200 Cal.

of February, A. D. 1926 . . . did then and there wilfully, unlawfully, feloniously and burglariously enter car S. N. 2100 . . . with the felonious intent then and there to commit the crime of larceny. . . . "

On March 6, 1926, Speascock pleaded guilty to the information and asked for probation; he then became a witness against this defendant. There was no other testimony directly connecting defendant with commission of the crime.

Speascock testified in substance as follows: That on the evening of February 1st, he went with this defendant and Hudson to Haggins yards. They entered an empty box-car to sleep. Shortly afterward defendant left the car and later called Hudson, who joined him; shortly thereafter he, Speascock, also left the car and upon getting out saw defendant and Hudson in car No. 2100, the door being open. He stated: "I stood there just a few minutes, I don't remember which one of the boys first handed me the hams, but he told me to take them, and I did. . . . I took them on the other side of the track and laid them in the lot." He testified that he did not know they were going to break into this box-car and had nothing to do with the breaking; that he piled the hams on the ground and after a large number were taken the three of them wrapped them in defendant's overcoat and secreted them at a point about 150 feet from the car. After the arrest Speascock accompanied a police officer to the spot and the hams were recovered.

[1] Section 1111 of the Penal Code provides: "A conviction cannot be had upon the testimony of an accomplice unless it be corroborated by such other evidence as shall tend to connect the defendant with the commission of the offense. . . . An accomplice is hereby defined as one who is liable to prosecution for the identical offense charged against the defendant on trial in the cause in which the testimony of the accomplice is given."

The question is: Was Speascock an accomplice? It is perfectly clear that not only was he "liable to prosecution for the identical offense charged against the defendant," but he was in fact convicted on a plea of guilty of the identical offense charged against defendant herein.

Nevertheless, it is urged that as Speascock did not enter the car, he was guilty of larceny according to the facts and not of burglary; that therefore he could not be an accom- Feb. 1927.] PEOPLE v. ALLISON. 407

plice to the crime of burglary; that the evidence was such as clearly to make the question one of fact for the jury to determine and, in this instance, relying upon certain alleged erroneous instructions, the jury rendered a special verdict as follows: "Was Daniel E. Speascock an accomplice in the commission of the crime of burglary as charged in the information . . . ? No."

[2] Section 459 of the Penal Code provides: "Every person who enters any . . . railroad car . . . with intent to commit grand or petit larceny or any felony is guilty of burglary." There is certainly no evidence to disprove the fact that Speascock did enter the car. If he reached up into the car, as he must have done to take the hams from the persons inside, his reaching in was an entry, coupled with the intent to abstract the hams, sufficient to constitute the crime of burglary.

[3] Or even if it be argued that the evidence does not prove the actual introduction of his arm into the car, nevertheless, it is clear that whenever he took a ham from his confederate inside, his arm was extended by the length of the ham to its contact with the hand of the other within the car and, under the authorities, as will be shown by those hereinafter cited, this too would be deemed an entry, coupled with the specified intent, sufficient to constitute the crime of burglary, just as though he had reached into the car with the aid of a hooked stick or other artificial appliance, and extracted the hams.

"It is not necessary that the party shall get his whole body into the house. The least entry of any part of the body is sufficient, as the entry of the hand, or a finger only, or of the head or the foot." (9 Cor. Jur. 1020, sec. 24; State v. McCall, 4 Ala. 643 [39 Am. Dec. 314]; Fisher v. State, 43 Ala. 17.)

"However, we do not construe the statute as meaning that there should be an entering of the whole body into the car, but an entry into the car, however slight, such as putting the hand through the opening with the intent to steal property, etc., therefrom, would be an entry in the meaning of the statute . . . " (Price v. Commonwealth, 129 Ky. 716 [112 S. W. 855].)

"When the thief breaks the house, and his body or any part thereof, as his foot or his arm, is within any part of 408 PEOPLE v. ALLISON. [200 Cal.

the house, it is deemed an entry; or when he puts a gun into a window which he has broken (though the hand be not in), . . . this is an entry. . . . The same is true of the mere introduction of the offender's finger. . . . It has been said that discharging a loaded gun into a house is a sufficient entry." (1 Wharton's Criminal Law, 10th ed., pp. 695, 696, secs. 774, 775, 776.)

"The statute dispenses with breaking but clearly contemplates the necessity for an entry. . . . No words are found in the statute qualifying the character, kind, time or manner of entry, save that such entry must be accompanied with the specified intent." (4 Cal. Jur., p. 718, sec. 3; see, also, *People v. Barry*, 94 Cal. 481 [29 Pac. 1026].)

"A breaking is not an essential element of the crime of burglary, as an entry of any character made for the purpose, and with the intent to commit the crime of grand or petty larceny is sufficient." (Syllabus, *People v. Ferns*, 27 Cal. App. 285 [149 Pac. 802].)

[4] In view of these authorities, in our opinion, it was error to submit to the jury the special verdict above quoted. There was no conflict in the evidence and it called for a finding not upon a question of fact, but upon a question of law; and it was in effect prejudicial to defendant. As stated in *People v. Coffey*, 161 Cal. 433, 436 [39 L. R. A. (N. S.) 704, 119 Pac. 901]: "When the question of an accomplice arises in the trial of a case, the general and accepted rule is for the court to instruct the jury touching the law of accomplices, and leave the question whether or not the witness be an accomplice for the decision of the jury as a matter of fact. (*People v. Kraker*, 72 Cal. 459 [1 Am. St. Rep. 65, 14 Pac. 196].) Whenever the facts themselves are in dispute, that is to say, whenever the question is whether the witness did or did not do certain things, which, admittedly, if he did do them, make him an accomplice, the jury's finding, upon familiar principles, is not disturbed. But where the facts are not in dispute, where the acts and conduct of the witness are admitted, it becomes a question of law for the court to say whether or not those acts and facts make the witness an accomplice. For the law declares in mandatory terms that 'A conviction cannot be had on the testimony of an accomplice, unless he is corroborated by other evidence which in itself, and without the aid of Feb. 1927.] PEOPLE v. ALLISON. 409

the testimony of the accomplice, tends to connect the defendant with the commission of the offense, and the corroboration is not sufficient if it merely shows the commission of the offense or the circumstances thereof.' (Pen. Code, sec. 1111.) Therefore, whenever upon appeal it is argued that the conviction was had upon the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice, it is equivalent to a declaration that the verdict is contrary to the law and the evidence, and this is always a legal question. (Pen. Code, sec. 1181, subd. 6.) Hence, in every proper case, a court of appeals is called upon to consider whether or not the witness is an accomplice, and, if so, whether his evidence has received the corroboration demanded by the law before a defendant may be convicted upon it."

It is also apparent from the foregoing authorities that appellant's complaint that the following instruction was erroneous is justified: "You are instructed that if the witness Speascock did not aid or encourage the breaking or entering of the car, if you find such car was broken and entered, and if you further find that he took no part in the breaking and entering of the car, if you find such car was broken and entered, then you are instructed he is not an accomplice within the meaning of the law although he may have received hams while standing outside from persons who were on the inside of the car, if you find such hams were so received."

In further support of this view we quote again from *People v. Coffey*, supra: "Wherever the commission of a crime involves the co-operation of two or more people, the guilt of each will be determined by the nature of that co-operation. Whenever the co-operation of the parties is a corrupt co-operation, then always those agents are accomplices, even as at common law they were principals."

This conclusion renders unnecessary a consideration of the other points urged by appellant.

Judgment reversed.

In the Matter of the Estate of J. GOODWIN THOMPSON, Deceased. AGNES BOYD THOMPSON, Respondent, v. GAIL WATKINS, Appellant.

[1] ESTATES OF DECEASED PERSONS—WILLS—OPPOSITION TO PROBATE OF—MINOR HEIRS—NOTICE.—Minor children who are legatees under a will and residents of the county in which a petition for its probate is filed should be served with copies of written grounds of opposition to the probate of the will, under the provisions of section 1312 of the Code of Civil Procedure.

[2] ID.—UNDUE INFLUENCE—CONFIDENTIAL RELATIONS—RULE.—A confidential relationship and opportunity to influence a testator are not sufficient to overthrow a will, but there must be proof of the exercise of that influence to actually overthrow the mind and will of the testator at the moment of executing the will.

[3] ID.—EXECUTION OF WILL—PARTICIPATION OF LEGATEE.—The reply, "All right," of a legatee, made to the testator's statement that he intended to make a change in his will, is no evidence of participation of the legatee in the making of the will.

[4] ID.—NATURALNESS OF WILL.—A will is not unnatural in making a modest provision for the support of a woman who had worked for the testator for a number of years in accumulating his property, without salary, and to whom he was to be married, where the testator had no one depending upon him, his mother being aged and having sufficient for her support, and he having left the bulk of his estate to minor children of his brother and sister.

[5] ID.—WILL CONTEST—EVIDENCE.—In a will contest, the jury is not at liberty to decide, without evidence, that a legatee has not narrated all of a conversation about the will and that more was said upon the subject; nor has it the right to infer from the fact that the decedent gave a diamond ring to said legatee she importuned the gift and that if she importuned the gift she also importuned the execution of the will.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Superior Court of Alameda County. M. C. Chapman, Judge pro tem. Reversed.

The facts are stated in the opinion of the court.

Casper A. Ornbaun, Preston & Duncan and Albert E. Carter for Appellant.

Philip M. Carey, Law T. Freitas, Sullivan & Sullivan and Theo. J. Roche and Henry G. Tardy for Respondent.

FINCH, J., pro tem.—The record in this case does not show whether the minor beneficiaries under the will referred to in the following opinion, who were residents of the county in which the proceeding was instituted, were served with a copy of the written grounds of opposition to the probate of the will or that they appeared in the proceeding. The cause was tried by a judge pro tempore, agreed upon in writing by the proponent of the will and the contestant, it not appearing that the said minor beneficiaries were parties to such agreement. An interesting question has arisen as to whether the agreement of only a part of the persons interested in the estate is sufficient to give the judge pro tempore jurisdiction to try the cause. It is not necessary, however, to decide this question, because the judgment must be reversed on other grounds.

Appellant contends that the court was without jurisdiction to render judgment because of failure to serve such minor heirs. This point was not raised in the trial court. If the objection had been made in the trial court, that court doubtless would have made an appropriate order bringing in the minor beneficiaries, and such beneficiaries should be brought in before the retrial of the cause. The following parts of 412 ESTATE OF THOMPSON. [200 Cal.
the opinion of the district court of appeal, written by Mr. Presiding Justice Langdon, are adopted as the opinion of this court:

"This appeal is by the defendant Gail Watkins, who was a beneficiary under a purported will of Dr. J. Goodwin Thompson, which will she produced and offered for probate. The mother of Dr. Thompson, Agnes Boyd Thompson, contested the probating of this will, alleging as grounds for the contest, first, that Dr. Thompson was mentally incompetent at the time of the making of the purported will; second, that it was not entirely written, dated and signed in the handwriting of the testator, and, third, that if said will were executed by decedent, its execution was procured by fraud and undue influence on the part of Gail Watkins, the proponent of the will.

"During the trial the issue of mental incompetency was withdrawn, testimony directed to that issue was stricken from the record, and the case went to the jury upon the other two grounds of contest.

". . . The purported will . . . reads as follows:

"'S. P. Limited No. 2,

"'Sept. 26/23.

"'This is my last will & Testament.

"'My residence and grounds between Webster and Franklin Sts. to go to Gail Watkins also the mortgage on her Father's ranch. This is done for services rendered & her close attention to duty. The rest of my property after all debts are paid to go equally to Grace's & Bobs (my sister & Bro) children on the youngest becoming of age. If any other proven claimant, the sum of $10.

"'I hereby appoint Gail Watkins my Guardian.

"'Dr. J. Goodwin Thompson.'

"It is apparent that a judgment declaring the foregoing document not to be the last will and testament of Dr. Thompson and denying the petition to have it admitted to probate affects, adversely, not only the rights of Gail Watkins, but the rights of the nieces and nephews of the testator, the residuary legatees. The petition alleges 'that the names, ages and residences of the legatees and devisees of said deceased, so far as known to the petitioner are: Boyd Eubank, aged about 13 years and Rule Eubank, aged about 11 years, chil- Feb. 1927.] ESTATE OF THOMPSON. 413

dren of Grace Eubank, a sister of said deceased, residing with their mother at 1027 59th Street, Oakland, California,' etc.

[1] "The sister of deceased, Mrs. Grace Eubank, was a witness for the contestant, and stated that she had two minor children and resided in Oakland, California. These minor children, being legatees under the will and residents of the county in which the petition for its probate was filed, should have been served with copies of the written grounds of opposition to the probate of the will, under the provisions of section 1312, Code of Civil Procedure. There is no showing in the record of an appointment of a guardian to represent the interests of these minors under the provisions of section 372 and 373, Code of Civil Procedure. . . .

"This case well illustrates the possibilities of injustice being done through the failure to have the interests of minors legally represented. Here the proponent of the will was not a blood relative of the deceased. The will left her only a portion of the estate, the balance to minor nephews and nieces of testator. The aged mother of testator, as his only heir at law, was the contestant. The mother of two of the minors who were legatees under the will and the father of the other two minors, also legatees, sister and brother respectively of decedent, testified for the contestant and assisted to their utmost in overthrowing the will and depriving their minor children of their rights thereunder. These two witnesses were the natural guardians of these children and their desires and interests seem to have been opposed to the interests of these children. . . .

"As we have indicated, the case went to the jury upon two questions, one was the undue influence exercised upon testator. After the contestant had rested her case, the attorney for the proponent of the will made a motion for nonsuit as to the issue of undue influence, calling attention to the absence of any evidence in the record that any undue influence had been exerted to cause the making of the will. The testimony was undisputed that proponent had known decedent for several years, during most of which time she assisted him in his office as office nurse. She was engaged to be married to him, according to her testimony, and had drawn no salary for her services in connection with the doctor's business. While he was in New York in 1922 he made and executed a will substantially like the one offered for probate. 414 ESTATE OF THOMPSON. [200 Cal.
There is no evidence that Miss Watkins exercised any control over this testamentary act. In September, 1923, Dr. Thompson went to Chicago. Miss Watkins and her sister accompanied him to the train. Both women testified that the doctor stated to Miss Watkins that he was going to mail her another will; that he wished to make a slight change, as he had failed to appoint any one to take charge of his estate in the event of his death. Within a day or two after his departure Miss Watkins received the document in controversy through the mails. It was substantially the same as the prior will, with the addition of the provision for a 'Guardian.' It was accompanied by a letter. Both were written upon the stationery of the railroad company. This will was placed by Miss Watkins in the doctor's safe, together with the former will made in New York. During his last illness the doctor asked for the two wills, re-read them and tore up the earlier one and handed the other back to Miss Watkins, and she again placed it in the safe.

[2] "True, contestant established the existence of a confidential relationship, and probably—to present the matter most strongly in her favor—she established the ability on the part of Miss Watkins to influence the doctor by reason of his affection for her, as evidenced by his numerous letters over a period of years. But these elements are not sufficient without a showing of actual participation by the beneficiary in the making of the will. (Estate of Baird, 176 Cal. 381 [168 Pac. 561]; Estate of Anderson, 185 Cal. 700, at pages 707 et seq. [198 Pac. 407]; Estate of Bryson, 191 Cal. 521, 541 [217 Pac. 525]; Estate of Wall, 187 Cal. 50 [200 Pac. 929]; Estate of Clark, 170 Cal. 418 [149 Pac. 828]; Estate of Lavinburg, 161 Cal. 536 [119 Pac. 915].)

"The court, in denying the motion for nonsuit, gave as its reason that Miss Watkins was a stranger to the blood of the testator; that she benefited by the will; that a confidential relationship existed between her and the testator, and further said: 'So far as I now recall the testimony, there was some participation by Miss Watkins in the preparation of the will. If I am not mistaken, she discussed with him the question of making a will, on the very day that this will is said to have been executed and, as I recall it, at the 16th street depot, in this city, when he was about to take a train Feb. 1927.] ESTATE OF THOMPSON. 415

for Chicago, I believe, or some place in the East. Now that is some evidence of participation. It may be slight.' The evidence referred to has been mentioned heretofore. To be exact, it is as follows: 'He (decedent) said, "I am going to mail another will to you:" He said, "I want to make a little change in the other one," and I said, "All right," and he said, "I failed to appoint anyone to take charge of my estate in the other will in case of my death."' The sister of Miss Watkins, who was present, gave substantially the same account of this conversation.

[3] "This reply of 'All right' made by Miss Watkins to the doctor's statement that he intended to make a change in his will, we think, was no evidence of participation on her part in the making of the will.

[4] "The respondent, in response to this attack upon the judgment, argues that the undue influence was shown by circumstantial evidence, instancing what she terms the unnatural provisions of the will; that the testator was not in good health; that a confidential relation existed between the testator and Miss Watkins. While unnatural provisions in a will do not destroy its potency as a testamentary act if the will was freely and voluntarily executed by a testator of sound and disposing mind, it might be pertinent to remark that in this case the provisions of the will do not seem as unnatural as respondent contends. The only heir at law of the doctor was his mother, who was 84 years of age and who had sufficient property for her support during her life. His brothers and sisters were, apparently, of full age and had families of their own. He left the bulk of his estate to their minor children. Gail Watkins had worked with him in accumulating his property during a period of four or five years and, according to her testimony, had received no salary. His numerous letters to her show his constant thought of her and her welfare. His statements to others indicated his appreciation of what he considered her untiring service in his behalf, and the will itself expresses this idea. According to the testimony of Miss Watkins and of others she and the doctor were to have been married. In view of all these facts, it does not seem unnatural that the doctor, having no one dependent upon him, should make a modest provision for the support of this woman who was apparently his most confidential and closest associate. 416 ESTATE OF THOMPSON. [200 Cal.
"While it is in evidence that the doctor had some weakness or disease of the heart which caused illness from time to time, there is nothing to indicate that his mind and will were impaired. . . . All the authorities herein cited emphasize the rule that a confidential relationship and opportunity to influence testator are not sufficient to overthrow a will, but that there must be proof of the exercise of that influence to actually overpower the mind and will of the testator at the moment of executing the will.

[5] "Respondent urges that the jury was at liberty to decide that Miss Watkins did not narrate all the conversation about the will and that more was said upon that subject. We know of no rule of law by which a jury may thus supplement the evidence by its own imaginings.

"Miss Watkins also testified that the doctor had given her a diamond ring on one occasion and respondent makes much of this, saying that the jury had a right to infer (without any evidence to that effect) 'that she had importuned this gift from him and if she importuned the diamond ring . . . she also importuned the execution of a will. . . .' Cases are not to be so manufactured by juries, and the necessity of resorting to inference upon inference against the evidence in the record in order to warrant the submission of this issue to the jury, demonstrates the error of the ruling upon this question, and that the motion for nonsuit should have been granted.

"Although the appellant points out that the two special verdicts submitted to the jury were inconsistent, one being that the will was not written, dated and signed by the testator and the other being that it was procured by undue influence, it is not necessary to go into that objection, but for the purposes of this appeal we may take the position of the respondent—that if the evidence sustains the verdict upon either issue, the judgment should stand. . . . Conceding that there was some testimony for the contestant upon this [the former] issue which would warrant a finding by the jury in her favor, certain erroneous rulings upon evidence, relating to this issue, which must have prejudiced greatly proponent's case, demand a reversal of the judgment, even though it be considered as based on this issue alone.

[6] "The court refused to permit proponent to state the conversation she had with testator upon his return from Chi- Feb. 1927.] ESTATE OF THOMPSON. 417

cago; which conversation it is claimed would have shown the existence of the will. She was asked: 'What, if any, conversation did you have with Dr. J. Goodwin Thompson upon his return after you went to the train with him on September 26, 1923, about the will?' This question was objected to and proponent's attorney stated that its object was to show that the will was in existence and that the doctor saw the will; that it was not an attempt to prove the contents of the will or any of the circumstances of the will. The court refused to admit this testimony on the ground that it was hearsay.

"During the examination of proponent's sister, the court refused to admit testimony regarding remarks made by testator upon the subject of his will to establish the fact that a will was in existence. These rulings are in direct conflict with the cases of Estate of Thompson, 185 Cal. 763, 767 [198 Pac. 795]; Estate of Sweetman, 185 Cal. 27 [195 Pac. 918]. Whatever doubt may have existed in the past about the application of the rule of these cases where the issue is forgery, is set at rest by the recent case of Estate of Morrison, 198 Cal. 1 [242 Pac. 939], in which our Supreme Court considers most carefully the authorities upon all phases of the general subject and concludes with the adoption of the rule in the case of Hoppe v. Byers, 60 Md. 381, which is summarized as holding that declarations of a testator that he had made a will and had named therein the proponent thereof as his sole beneficiary were admissible in evidence as tending to show the existence of such a document prior to the death of the decedent. The only real issue between the parties in this action was the genuineness of the purported will—whether or not it was written by the testator. The issue in the Morrison case was the same as the issue upon which the proponent in this case sought to introduce the excluded testimony, i. e., forgery. The relevancy to that issue of declarations of the testator regarding the disposition of his property is discussed in the case of Adams v. Ristine, 138 Va. 273 [31 A. L. R. 1413, 122 S. E. 126, 135], wherein it is said:

"'At the request of the contestants and over the objection of the proponents, the court gave the following instruction: "The court instructs the jury that statements of Lewis M. Adams as to how he intended to dispose of his

200 Cal.—27 418 ESTATE OF THOMPSON. [200 Cal.
property at his death go only to the question of the probability or improbability of his making the disposition of his property set forth in the alleged will, and does not affect the question of whether said alleged will is in the genuine handwriting of Lewis M. Adams or not."

"'It is said by counsel for contestants that "This instruction was intended to tell the jury that if they believed that the alleged will was not in the genuine handwriting of Lewis M. Adams, any statements made by him before his death, as to how he intended to dispose of his property, would not be sufficient to justify a verdict in favor of the proponent of the alleged will.""

"'But the instruction does not express that intention. It says that the statements of the testator as to the intended disposition of his property do not affect the question of whether or not the will was in the handwriting of Lewis M. Adams, when in fact it might have a very serious effect. If the jury thought that the evidence as to the execution of the will left the question in doubt, they would probably give very serious consideration to the statements of the testator as to his intended disposition of his property."

"'In Samuel v. Hunter's Ex'x., 122 Va. 636 [95 S. E. 399], it is said that "Such declarations, standing alone, are not admissible as direct evidence to prove or disprove the genuineness of the will; but that in all cases where its genuineness has been assailed by other proper evidence, the declarations are admissible as circumstances, either to strengthen or weaken the assault, according to their inconsistency or their harmony with the existence or terms of the will"—thus showing not only the admissibility of such testimony, but its influence."

"'The instruction was at least misleading, if not positively erroneous, and it was error to give it.'

"'In the instant case, various declarations of the testator bearing upon the genuineness of the will, in addition to those just discussed, were either disallowed, or, if admitted, deprived of their force, so far as the genuineness of the will was concerned, by the instructions of the court."

"'There are numerous other objections urged by appellant regarding rulings upon the admission of evidence Feb. 1927.] KENNY v. CHRISTIANSON. 419

of more or less merit and importance, but it is unnecessary to discuss them all."
The judgment is reversed.

RICHARDS, J.—This appeal is from a judgment of the trial court in favor of the defendant Morris Christianson in an action instituted by the plaintiff for the recovery of the possession of an automobile, or, in the alternative, for the recovery of $600 in case delivery cannot be had. The complaint was in the usual form employed in actions for claim and delivery, wherein the plaintiff alleged that on June 29, 1925, she was and ever since has been and now is the owner and entitled to the possession of said automobile, describing the same, and that on or about August 22, 1925, the defendant had wrongfully taken and since retained said automobile from the possession of the plaintiff, notwithstanding her demand for the return to her of the possession thereof. The defendant in his answer denied, for want of information or belief, that the plaintiff was the owner or entitled to the possession of said personal property, and denied that he had ever taken wrongful possession of the same, or that his detention thereof was unlawful; but, on the contrary, alleged that from a time prior to the commence- Feb. 1927.] KENNY v. CHRISTIANSON. 421

ment of the action and ever since said time he had been and continued to be the owner of and entitled to the possession thereof. The cause went to trial before the court upon the issues thus presented, and upon the conclusion of the trial the court made and filed its findings of fact and conclusions of law, in the course of which the court found that the plaintiff on or about July 23, 1925, was the owner and in possession of said car, but that on or about said date she had delivered the same to one Pat E. Patterson in the city of Sacramento, where said Patterson was then and there engaged in the business of selling second-hand or used cars, and had instructed Patterson to sell said automobile; and that said car had thereupon been placed upon the premises used by Patterson in the conduct of his business, and, with other cars of said Patterson, was offered and exposed for sale; that the defendant Christianson, while said car was thus in the possession of Patterson and was being, under his said authority and at his said place of business, offered and exposed for sale, had purchased the said automobile from Patterson on the twenty-second day of August, 1925, and had thereupon fully paid to him the purchase price thereof, and that thereupon Patterson delivered to said purchaser said car, and that Christianson had ever since continued to be the owner and in rightful possession of the same. The court also in its findings expressly negatived the averments of the plaintiff's complaint to the effect that Christianson's possession and detention of said personal property was wrongful. As a conclusion of law the court found that the plaintiff was not entitled to any relief in said action. From the judgment accordingly entered the plaintiff prosecutes this appeal.

[1] The first contention of the plaintiff is that the trial court was in error in permitting the defendant to introduce certain evidence in support of his claim of ownership and of the right to possession of said car. This contention is based upon the appellant's assertion that since the defendant by the form of his pleading asserted title to said personal property derived from some source in opposition to and contrary to the source of plaintiff's title, and since the evidence offered by him failed to show such derivation, the court was in error in permitting him to introduce the same. This contention is utterly without merit. 422 KENNY v. CHRISTIANSON. [200 Cal.
The defendant's asserted ownership and right of possession of said machine being alleged by him to exist from a time prior to the commencement of said action, he was entitled to show any source of his said title, whether derived from the plaintiff or not. The pleadings, while simple and brief, were in the usual form of the pleadings and denials in action for the recovery of the possession of personal property, and the issue presented thereby was as to which of the parties to the action was entitled to the possession of such property at the time of the commencement of the action; and the trial court was therefore justified in considering any proof which bore upon this issue.

[2] Appellant's next contention is that the finding of the trial court to the effect that the plaintiff had delivered the possession of said property to Pat E. Patterson with instruction to sell the same was not supported by the evidence. The most that can be said of this contention is that the evidence upon that subject is conflicting. When the automobile was delivered to Patterson by the plaintiff or her agent he signed and delivered to the agent of the plaintiff, who delivered the same to her, a receipt which showed that he had "received of Kenny Collection Agency One Cadillac Tour to be sold for six hundred dollars net." The evidence further showed that subsequently to the issuance of said receipt the plaintiff had, through her duly authorized agent, reduced the price to $450. The evidence further showed that at the time of the delivery of said car to Patterson he was engaged in the business of a dealer in and seller of used cars at a fixed place of business, and was in fact a factor within the definition of that term as set forth in section 2026 of the Civil Code. While it is true that the plaintiff, through her testimony and that of her agent, undertook to limit the authority of Patterson to that of merely finding a purchaser for the car, the evidence on the whole, we think, sufficiently discloses that Patterson was so far invested with the possession and control over the car and with authority to sell the same for the designated price as to be entitled as such factor to deliver possession of the car to such purchaser as would pay the same, and to execute a bill of sale to such purchaser. These several acts Patterson did in his capacity as such Feb. 1927.] KENNY v. CHRISTIANSON. 423

factor and as the plaintiff's agent; but the evidence shows that having done so he absconded without having paid over to the plaintiff the amount received by him from Christianson for the purchase price in full of said car. In so doing, however, he continued to be the agent of the plaintiff, and for his wrongful act in the embezzlement of the purchase price of the car the defendant Christianson was in no-wise responsible. This case as to the foregoing aspects of it would seem to come squarely within the decision in the case of Carter v. Rowley, 59 Cal. App. 486 [211 Pac. 267], wherein in a well-reasoned opinion that court held that the purchaser of an automobile under circumstances much similar to those herein presented was entitled to retain or recover the possession of the personal property thus acquired.

[3] Plaintiff's next contention is that the defendant was not entitled to assert his ownership and right of possession of said automobile in this action for the reason that the evidence disclosed that there had never been issued to him the certificate of registration and ownership provided for in section 45, subdivision e, of the Motor Vehicle Act of 1925 [Stats. 1925, p. 402], which section provides for the issuance by the motor vehicle department of such certificate of ownership and registration upon every transfer of title or of an interest in a motor vehicle, and further provides that until such certificates are issued "delivery of such vehicle shall not be deemed to have been made and title thereto shall not be deemed to have passed, and said intended transfer shall be deemed to be incomplete and not to be valid or effective for any purpose." The scope and meaning of this provision of the Motor Vehicle Act was before this court in the case of Parke v. Franciscus, 194 Cal. 284 [228 Pac. 435], wherein this court held that while a compliance with said section and subdivision was essential to complete the transfer of title to the motor vehicle sought to be transferred and delivered to a purchaser, the failure of the transferee of the ownership of such car to procure the registration certificate required by the terms of said act did not render his right to the possession thereof so incomplete as to make the assertion thereof unavailing to him in an action against him by the vendor of the automobile thus actually sold and delivered to a purchaser in good 424 KENNY v. CHRISTIANSON. [200 Cal.
faith and for a full consideration. In so deciding, this court referred with approval to the case of *Boles v. Stiles*, 188 Cal. 304 [204 Pac. 848], wherein this court held that where an owner of an automobile had by his own act and agreement placed another in the immediate and exclusive possession thereof he was not in position thereafter, in an action for claim and delivery, to invoke the provisions of the Motor Vehicle Act above referred to. A similar ruling was made by the appellate court in the case of *Chucovich v. San Francisco Securities Corp.*, 60 Cal. App. 700 [214 Pac. 263], that court basing its ruling upon the decision in the case of *Boles v. Stiles*, *supra*. In the face of these authorities we are constrained to hold that the plaintiff was not entitled to rely upon the provisions of the Motor Vehicle Act in question to sustain her own title or to defeat the defendant's right of possession based upon the foregoing transaction.

[4] The appellant makes the final contention that the defendant's claim that the plaintiff is not entitled to rely upon the aforesaid provisions of the Motor Vehicle Act to defeat the defendant's claim is a defense, based upon estoppel, and that the defendant was not entitled to the benefit of such defense because of his failure to plead such estoppel. In making this contention plaintiff relies upon the familiar rule that the defense of an equitable estoppel is one which must be pleaded. This rule, however, has only application to cases wherein the plaintiff bases his sole reliance for his recovery in said action upon a claim of title which he is estopped to urge. Where, however, a plaintiff, as in this case, bases her alleged right of recovery in the first instance upon the original claim of ownership of the property in question and upon her contention that the person through whom the defendant acquired title to said property had no authority from her to dispose of the same, the defendant is not required in his pleadings to anticipate such other contentions as the plaintiff may seek to rely upon when her main reliance for her right of recovery has failed her, and which do not appear upon the face of her complaint. In such cases the defendant may await the assertion by plaintiff in her proof of such additional foundation for Feb. 1927.] HARTWIG v. UNION SCHOOL DIST. 425

her right of recovery and may then oppose the same with his evidence of an equitable estoppel.

The judgment is affirmed.

LANGDON, J.—This is an appeal by plaintiffs from a judgment in an action to quiet title to certain real property in Sutter County, California. The judgment decreed that neither the plaintiffs nor the defendants had any right, title, or interest in the land in controversy.

On August 4, 1873, the land involved here, as a part of a larger tract, was the property of James W. Gaither, and on that date he and his wife, by good and sufficient deed, granted to the trustees of the Gaither School District a lot consisting of one acre and 106 square rods, situated in the northwest quarter of section 32, township 14 north of range 3 east, Mount Diablo meridian, and running south nineteen rods; thence east fourteen rods; thence north nineteen rods, and thence west fourteen rods to the place of beginning. This deed contained the condition that said premises should be used for educational purposes only and that when they ceased to be so used they should revert to the grantors thereof, their heirs and assigns.

According to the stipulation of the parties as to facts and the findings of the trial court, about a year after the execution of the deed above mentioned, Gaither and his wife granted and conveyed to Bethel Way "the Northwest quarter of section thirty-two, Township Fourteen north, Range three East, Mount Diablo Meridian in Sutter County, California, containing 160 acres, less one acre and one hundred and six square rods deeded by said James W. Gaither and M. E. Gaither, his wife in the year 1873 to Gaither School District, said lot being the northwest corner of the above parcel of land."

There were no further conveyances from the Gaithers, and the plaintiffs, by mesne conveyances, have succeeded to all right, title, and interest of Bethel Way under the aforementioned deed to him by Gaithers in 1873. In the meantime, as found by the trial court, the land granted to the school district had ceased to be used for school purposes for more than three years prior to the bringing of this action. The "school land" had reverted, therefore (Papst v. Hamilton, 133 Cal. 631 [66 Pac. 10]), and the question presented Feb. 1927.] HARTWIG v. UNION SCHOOL DIST. 427

by the record is whether that reversionary interest remained in the heirs of Gaither, who were not parties to this action, or whether it passed by deed made in 1873 from Gaithers to Bethel Way and from Bethel Way, through successive transfers, to the present plaintiffs. The problem is determined by the language which we have quoted from said deed given by the Gaithers to Way.

[1] Appellants contend that this instrument grants the entire quarter-section and that the excepting clause is, in effect, meaningless, because it is at variance with the grant of the quarter-section. This argument proceeds upon the theory that the exception is an attempt to describe the property by acreage and that such description is secondary to a description by boundaries. We think this rule of construction has no application to the facts of this case. The grant was not of the entire quarter-section, but of the quarter-section, less one acre, more or less, which was more particularly described by reference to a previous conveyance. There is no ambiguity about the deed from the Gaithers to Way, and the intent of the parties must be gathered from the instrument itself and the language used therein. It is pertinent to inquire here, as was done in the opinion upon a closely similar state of facts (Seligman v. Carr, 8 Cal. App. 572 [97 Pac. 324]): "Why was the excepting clause inserted if not to reserve some interest in the grantors or to take some interest out of the operation of the deed?" In the case last mentioned, it was said, in considering a closely analogous state of facts: "In whom is vested the reversionary interest in the two acres conveyed to the school district, which is designated as the school land? The court found that a two-thirds interest belongs to plaintiffs and that one-third is vested in defendant Webb. The court decided that in view of the exception or reservation in the deed of William and John to Samuel Frey, of January 30, 1884, they conveyed to Samuel only an undivided half of their interest in that part of the twenty-acre tract that was not conveyed to the school district; that the school land was excepted from the operation of the deed and hence when Samuel Frey, in November, 1884, conveyed to Carr, his deed conveyed no greater reversionary interest in the school land than he reserved when he deeded to the 428 FARREN v. HOBBS. [200 Cal.

school district, which was one-third, and this the court awarded to defendant Webb."

[2] Our conclusion in the instant case, as well as the conclusion of the court in *Seligman v. Carr, supra*, is fortified by section 1069 of the Civil Code, which provides that a reservation in a grant is to be interpreted in favor of the grantor.

[3] It appears from the undisputed facts that neither the plaintiffs nor the defendants have any right, title, or interest in the land to which title was sought to be quieted, and the judgment and decree appealed from is affirmed.

LANGDON, J.—This is an appeal by the defendant from a judgment against her, in her capacity as executrix of the estate of A. L. Hobbs, deceased, for $4,286.95, in an action upon two assigned claims. One of these claims was for boring a well and the other for the purchase price of a pump for the well.

[1] The appellant, while approaching the matter from many directions, in substance, presents by her brief a determined attack upon the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain findings regarding the making of the contract for the pump and the performance of either the contract for the pump or for the boring of the well by the assignors of plaintiff.

Defendant's decedent, A. L. Hobbs, was the owner of a piece of land in Colusa County, part of which he had planted with trees and vines. In March, 1921, he made a contract with I. E. Florey, a well driller, under which Florey was to bore a 12-inch well upon this land so that a 9-stage, 90-foot pump of Western Well Works manufacture could be installed satisfactorily. The depth of the well was to be determined by Hobbs, who agreed to pay Florey seventy-five per cent of the money due him after the first one hundred feet had been drilled and seventy-five per cent of the amount due him after each additional fifty feet had been drilled and the balance in full when pump "is satisfactorily installed and operated." Florey also agreed to furnish "one twelve-inch number nine State Western Well Works Vertical Turbine pump with sufficient line shaft, line shaft couplings, discharge columns, oil conduits, etc. to place the bowls of the pump approximately 90 feet below the surface of the ground. . . . Pump to be delivered within thirty days." The price of the pump was to be $2,070 installed complete, less two and one-half per cent. 430 FARREN v. HOBBS. [200 Cal.

There is no dispute about the execution of the foregoing contract. It was in writing and signed by the parties. After signing this contract, Florey contracted with the Western Well Works of San Jose for a pump in accordance with the specifications of his contract with Hobbs. He then proceeded to bore the well. He bored it twelve inches in diameter to a depth of 370 feet and then engaged another well digger, Steele, to carry it down at a diameter of ten inches, this reduction of diameter being decided upon by Hobbs and the drillers because there was danger of a collapse in the twelve-inch casing. Steele carried the well down to 494 feet, according to his testimony, and at this point Hobbs, after consultation with the drillers, decided there might be water enough to suit his needs and ordered Steele to make the perforations to let the water into the well. Steele did so and cleaned the well of sand and gravel to the bottom. Presumably the well was now ready for the pump. At this point Hobbs measured the depth of the well and, according to his testimony and that of the man who assisted him, it measured only 472 feet in depth. The prior measurement of Florey, according to his testimony, had disclosed a greater depth by about twenty feet. There is some uncertainty about the record as to how this occurred—perhaps through a mistake of one or the other of the parties, or perhaps through the filling in of sand and gravel; but, however it occurred, the discrepancy caused a dispute over the amount due for boring the well. Because of this dispute Florey refused to install the pump.

There is some variation in the testimony as to the next phase of the transaction and we shall recite the evidence most favorable to the findings made by the trial court. Mr. Hobbs telephoned to the Western Well Works, personally, and ordered a change in the pump which they were to supply under their contract with Florey. He ordered it changed from a 9-stage 90-foot pump to a 12-stage 140-foot pump and the company agreed to change it at an additional price of $585. The company confirmed this new order in a letter appearing in the transcript which, in part, reads as follows: "This will confirm our receipt of your telephone order to change the depth of your pump on contract dated March 17, 1921, from a 9 stage 90 foot pump to a 12 stage 140 foot pump. The price of this additional Feb. 1927.] FARREN v. HOBBS. 431

material will be $585.00." This letter was dated June 20, 1921. A clerk in the office of the Western Well Works testified that she had a telephone conversation with Hobbs on or about July 1, 1921, in which Hobbs told her that his pump was on his land and that Florey refused to install it. He also stated that Mr. Lavendar was present and that Mr. Lavendar was the man who was to install the pump under the Florey contract, but that Lavendar did not wish to install the pump over Florey's objections unless instructed so to do by the Western Well Works. Lavendar and Hobbs were together at the telephone and after the situation had been explained to the Western Well Works the clerk representing that company consulted with its attorney, who happened to be present, and then asked Hobbs if he would pay the company directly for the pump if it ordered it installed. Hobbs stated that he would do so and in reliance upon this promise Lavendar was called to the telephone and instructed by the company to install the pump. Hobbs was also told that the pump would be billed to him f. o. b. San Jose, and he said he would pay the Western Well Works for it. Lavendar proceeded to install the pump. It was ascertained that more extensions were required, and from time to time Hobbs telegraphed to the Western Well Works for such extensions, which were furnished. The pump and extensions were shipped directly to Hobbs. A statement of his account was sent to Hobbs each month by the Western Well Works, to which he made no objection.

On September 2, 1921, Hobbs wrote to the Western Well Works as follows:

"Yours of the 30th just received and in reply will say that the pump you have in my well is not satisfactory. It is pumping 350 to 150 gallons per min. and using 55 H.P. Using the same amount of H.P. pumping 150 as it does 350. The water does not break. . . . I do not know [what] the pull down is so am not sure at this time whether the trouble is in the quantity of water or the pump. But I do know it is not satisfactory. It would seem to me that it would be well for you to determine the draw down of the water in the well—and why using power enough for 500 gal. and only getting 150—is it up to me to determine this or you. I 432 FARREN v. HOBBS. [200 Cal.
feel that it is up to you to prove the efficiency of the pump. So please let me hear from you."

Mr. Lavendar was delegated to collect from Mr. Hobbs the money due to the Western Well Works, but could not make the collection.

Nothing was said in the telephone conversation between Hobbs and the Western Well Works about the disposition of the contract between that company and Florey, and as a matter of fact, when Florey learned that the company had ordered the pump installed at the request of Hobbs, Florey telegraphed to the company as follows: "You ordered pump in over me wire release on contract at once." Florey also went to Hobbs about the matter and Hobbs told him he was dealing directly with the Western Well Works. So much for the formation of the contracts involved here.

Many practical difficulties developed. Quantities of sand and gravel poured into the well and went through the pump with the water and the water supply was inadequate. Hobbs, evidently, attempted to exhaust the sand and gravel through the pump and ran the pump at times during the months of July, August, and September, making no complaint other than the foregoing letter complaining about the amount of horse-power the pump was using, which was made after another demand for payment. In June, 1922, Hobbs had the pump taken out of the well and found it was badly cut and worn by sand and gravel passing through it.

Florey assigned his claim for services in boring the well and the Western Well Works assigned their claim for the pump and extensions to the plaintiff, and during the pendency of the action which followed Hobbs died and his executrix was substituted in his place and stead.

The trial court found that Florey had performed all the conditions of his contract so far as the drilling of the well was concerned and had drilled the well to a depth of 492 feet and completed the same on or about July 1, 1921; that Florey did not install the pump provided for in said contract for the reason that the defendant Hobbs prevented him from doing so; that the wearing out of the parts of the said pump was caused by an improper use thereof by the defendant Hobbs, and that it is not true that the materials or workmanship employed in constructing the said pump were faulty or defective; that it is not true that the Feb. 1927.] FARREN v. HOBBS. 433

Western Well Works were ever duly advised or at all advised concerning any defects of said pump, appliances, or equipment.

There are also specific findings against the special defenses interposed by defendant, although they are also negatived in the findings above set forth.

[2] The foregoing evidence justifies the finding that a contract was made between Hobbs and the Western Well Works for the purchase and sale of a pump and appliances. The objection of appellant that such contract was not in writing is met by the evidence in the record showing that the pump was shipped to Hobbs at Arbuckle; he received it at the station, paid the freight on it, had it hauled to his ranch, installed it and tried it out, found that it exhausted the water quickly and would have to be placed deeper, and ordered several extensions for this purpose; that he operated the pump for several months, made no objection to it except the letter from which we have quoted herein, and did not deny liability under the bills rendered to him until the action was brought. These facts and circumstances take the case out of the statute of frauds.

An attempt is made by appellant to fasten upon either Western Well Works or Florey the responsibility for the infiltration of sand and gravel which ruined the pump and made the well unsatisfactory. Assuredly, this was not a risk assumed by the Western Well Works, nor a danger against which they contracted. Florey has testified that he cleaned out the well when Hobbs directed that it be perforated for water and the court has found that Florey performed his contract in the matter of drilling the well. The subsequent danger of sand and gravel pouring into the well appears from the record to be one which might be anticipated perhaps for years after the well was completed and was one which the owner of the land must necessarily guard against.

The respondent claims, and the record and findings bear him out, that the pump was ruined by operation under improper conditions, and that its condition was not chargeable in any way to any defects for which Western Well Works would be liable under a manufacturer's warranties.

200 Cal.—28 434 MOTT v. CLINE. [200 Cal.

The appellant's argument is divided and subdivided, but many of the matters urged are merely attacks from different angles upon the same ultimate facts found by the court, and there is no necessity for discussing these subdivisions separately. The foregoing discussion of the findings and the evidence supporting them disposes of every objection made by appellant.

The judgment appealed from is affirmed.

R. B. MOTT, Respondent, v. J. W. CLINE, Appellant.

[1] ALIEN LAND LAW—APPLICATION TO CHINESE—TREATY WITH CHINA.—The Alien Land Law of this state (Stats. 1913, p. 206; Stats. 1921, p. lxxxiii), is applicable to subjects of China, and it does not violate any treaty agreement between the United States and that nation.

[2] Id.—CONSTRUCTION OF UNITED STATES—CHINESE TREATY.—The existing treaty between the United States and China does not guarantee to Chinese subjects the right to acquire, enjoy, or occupy agricultural lands; and the rights, privileges, and immunities accorded to them are such only as are specified by the treaty, to wit: personal security and protection in their property rights against spoliation.

[3] Id.—CONVENTION COVENANT OF 1894—CONSTRUCTION.—The convention covenant of 1894 (28 U. S. Stats. at Large, p. 1210) between the United States and China, prohibiting the immigration of Chinese for a certain period and providing that those then in the United States under the treaty of 1881 should have for the protection of their persons and property all rights accorded citizens of the most-favored nation, excepting the right to become naturalized citizens, did not confer the right to acquire real property upon such Chinese.

[4] Id.—RIGHT TO CARRY ON TRADE—RIGHT TO OWN OR LEASE HOUSES—AGRICULTURAL LAND.—The right to carry on trade or to own or lease and occupy houses, manufactories, warehouses, and shops, or to lease land for residential and commercial purposes, or to do anything necessary for trade, cannot be said to include Feb. 1927.] MOTT v. CLINE. 435

the right to own or lease, or to have any title to, or interest in, land for agricultural purposes.

[5] Id.—CONSTITUTIONAL LAW.—The Alien Land Acts of this state are not repugnant to any article of the federal or state constitutions.

[6] Id.—RETROACTIVE EFFECT OF STATUTE—INTENT OF LEGISLATURE—POLICE POWER—OPTION TO PURCHASE LAND.—Whether the Alien Land Acts are retroactive, so far as an option to purchase land executed before the passage of the acts is concerned, depends upon the legislative intent and whether the objects sought to be attained are within the police power of the state; and while there is no direct language in the acts on this point, the general language implies an intention to prevent an executory contract from ripening into a fee simple.

[7] Id.—NATURE AND SCOPE OF POLICE POWER.—The police power of the state, being in its nature a continuous one, must ever be reposed somewhere, and cannot be barred or suspended by contract or irreparable law; and it is to be presumed that parties contract in contemplation of the inherent right of the state to exercise the police power that the sovereign always reserves to itself for the protection of peace, safety, health, and morals, and its effect cannot be nullified in advance by making contracts inconsistent with its enforcement.

[8] Id.—EXERCISE OF POLICE POWER—ALIEN LAND ACTS.—The adoption of the Alien Land Acts by this state was a lawful exercise of the police power, as ownership of the soil by persons morally bound by obligations of citizenship is vital to the political existence of the state.

[9] Id.—CONSTRUCTION OF ACT.—Conspiring to effect a transfer of real property or an interest therein, in violation of the Alien Land Law, which section 10 of the Act of 1920 makes a crime punishable as a misdemeanor or felony, is the only act that is made a public offense and penalized by imprisonment or fine, or by both, the exaction imposed for all other violations of the act inhibiting transfers being that the conveyance is rendered void as to the state and the real property escheats to the state upon action brought by the attorney-general or district attorney of the county in which the violation occurs.

[10] Id.—OPTION TO PURCHASE LAND—EXECUTION BEFORE PASSAGE OF ALIEN LAND LAW—ABSENCE OF CONSPIRACY.—Where a lease of agricultural land, containing an option to purchase in favor of a Chinese who is ineligible to citizenship, was made prior to the adoption of the Alien Land Laws of this state, the assignment of said option after the passage of such laws to one eligible to exercise all the rights and privileges of citizenship and the exercise of the option by such person does not violate the conspiracy provisions of said law, for under statutes forbidding ownership of land by aliens an alien grantee takes a defeasible estate free 436 MOTT v. CLINE. [200 Cal.

from attack by anyone except the government in escheat proceedings, and if said alien before the power of the state is invoked in an escheat proceeding conveys the property to a person eligible to hold it the infirmity of title is removed.

[11] Id.—ASSIGNABILITY OF OPTION.—An option to purchase agricultural land contained in a lease of such land, where the contract contains no features of personal trust or confidence reposed in any of the parties and requires nothing more than a mere routine of paying money, is assignable, and the option provision is severable from all other provisions of the lease.

[12] Id.—SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE—TENDER OF RENT—INSUFFICIENCY OF—SECTION 1935, CIVIL CODE.—Under section 1935 of the Civil Code, where the holder of an option to purchase contained in a lease exercises the option between rent days a proportionate amount of rent must be tendered for the period of occupancy before exercise of the option or specific performance will not be decreed.

[13] Id.—WAIVER OF OBJECTION TO TENDER—BURDEN OF PROOF.—The burden is on the party asserting a waiver of objection to a tender to prove the same.

SEAWELL, J.—This action was brought by the assignee of a lessee who was also the holder of an option against the owner and lessor of the let premises to compel specific performance of the option provision contained in the lease providing for the purchase by said lessee of the demised premises at any time during the term of the lease. Said assignee, who relies solely upon the assignment of the option to purchase, made a tender between rent days of the purchase price as agreed upon by the owner and lessee and demanded the execution and delivery to him of a deed of the demised lands. The owner and lessor refused to comply with the demand to convey. The answer raised the question of the sufficiency of the tender. Judgment went for the plaintiff (assignee), hence this appeal.

The lands in suit are agricultural lands and are situate in the county of Madera, this state. On January 13, 1913, appellant, owner and lessor of said lands, entered into a written contract of lease with Ah Chue, a person of Mongolian blood and a subject of the Empire of China, and alleged to be within the inhibitory provisions of Statutes 1913, page 206, and other subsequent Alien Land Acts, all of which were adopted subsequent to the execution of the lease contract containing the option to purchase, the assignability of which is challenged.

The term of said lease was for a period of ten years, commencing February 1, 1914, almost one year after its execution, at an annual rental of $200 for the first two years and $250 a year for the remainder of the term, payments to be made on the twentieth day of December of each year, commencing with December 20, 1914. By the provisions of said lease all improvements placed on the demised premises by either party were to belong to the lessor, 438 MOTT v. CLINE. [200 Cal.

and if the lessee should be in default at any time in the payment of rent or in the performance of any other covenant of the lease the lessor reserved the right to terminate the lease and retake possession of the premises. The option provision is contained in the following paragraph of the lease:

"And the said party of the first part, his heirs and assigns, does hereby covenant and agree, that the said party of the second part, or his legal representatives, paying the rental herein provided for, and keeping and performing the several covenants herein provided for, shall at all times during the full term of this lease have, hold and fully enjoy the said premises with its appurtenances without let or hindrance of or by the said party of the first part, his heirs or assigns, or any other person whomsoever. First party agrees to sell said premises at any time during the term hereof to said second party for the sum of $4100."

The lessee, on February 1, 1914, went into possession and cleared some thirty acres of land during his tenancy and paid all installments of rent except the installment payable on December 20, 1923, which was not due at the time the complaint was filed, to wit, June 18, 1923. On May 26, 1923, said Ah Chue executed the following instrument:

"I, Ah Chue, . . . do hereby sell, assign, transfer, set over, grant, bargain, sell, convey and confirm unto R. B. Mott . . . all of my right and option to purchase said real property set forth in said lease wherein it is provided that the said J. W. Cline 'agrees to sell said premises at any time during the term' of said lease 'for the sum of $4100.' It is intended hereby to subrogate the said R. B. Mott to every interest which I have in the said option included in said lease and to grant and assign the said option to the said R. B. Mott."

No claim is made that the leasehold was assigned, and no attempt was made to put respondent in possession as a subtenant. The lessee, in fact, continued in possession of the premises under the lease. By a separate paper Mott and Ah Chue agreed as follows:

"I will, as soon as delivery of a conveyance thereof is made by the said Cline, endeavor to sell said property at a profit and in the event of a sale will pay over to you Feb. 1927.] MOTT v. CLINE. 439

[Ah Chue] one-half of my profit on such sale. It is understood that you are to consent to a cancellation of your lease of such property to any such purchaser, should such purchaser desire such cancellation . . . All expenses to be paid by R. B. Mott."

On May 28, 1923, Mott served notice upon appellant Cline of the assignment of said option and made a tender to him of the sum of $4,100 and demanded a conveyance of said premises. The grounds of Cline's refusal, if any were stated, do not appear in the record. The points that the rentals were not fair and reasonable, and that $4,100 was not the fair and reasonable market value of the lands at the time the lease and contract were executed are not tenable. It was stipulated at the trial that $6,700 was then the fair market value of the premises.

The lease contract was executed before the passage of any of the inhibitory Alien Land Acts subsequently adopted by this state and before there was any law interdicting the ownership of land or any interest therein by any class of aliens. The alienage of Ah Chue was put in issue by the answer and it is the contention of appellant that the option provision is in violation of the 1913 act, *supra*, and the initiative Alien Land Act of 1920 (Stats. 1921, p. lxxxiii) enacted pursuant to the police power of the state and is therefore void. This being so, it is further argued, the option was neither assignable by Ah Chue nor enforceable against him. It is further contended that the lease contract is not severable or divisible on equitable grounds and to so hold would tend to impair the rights of the lessor to the rentals reserved, as the title would be transferred out of the lessor. It is also made grounds of complaint that Ah Chue occupied the premises for a period of about four months immediately prior to the assignment of the option, for which period he paid no rent to the lessor and none has since been paid or tendered for such occupancy by him or anyone in his behalf. His occupancy seems to have continued undisturbed after the execution of the assignment. Aside from the assignability of the option, the sufficiency of the tender and a few questions of pleading, the case is one hinging largely upon the application of the police power of the state and the construction to be given the statutes germane to the subject. 440 MOTT v. CLINE. [200 Cal.

Laws affecting the status of aliens in California are not of recent origin. Long prior to the adoption of laws declaring certain races ineligible to own real property in this state, the constitution provided that no native of China was eligible to citizenship. By article II, section 1 of the constitution of 1879, it was provided that every native male citizen of the United States who should have acquired the right of citizenship by virtue of the treaty of Querataro, and every male naturalized citizen thereof who should have become such ninety days prior to any election, of the age of twenty-one years, and who should have resided within the state, county, and precinct for the periods of time therein prescribed, should be entitled to vote at all elections held therein, provided further that "no native of China shall ever exercise the privileges of an elector." The above provision prescribing ineligibility has never been removed from our constitution. By the statute of 1913 it is provided that all aliens eligible to citizenship under the laws of the United States may acquire, possess, enjoy, transmit, and inherit real property, or any interest therein, in this state in the same manner and to the same extent as citizens of the United States, except as otherwise provided. It is further provided that all aliens not eligible to citizenship may acquire, possess, enjoy, and transfer real property, or any interest therein, in this state in the manner and to the extent and for the purposes prescribed by any treaty then existing between the government of the United States and the nation or country of which such alien is a citizen or subject, and not otherwise, and in addition thereto lease lands in this state for agricultural purposes for a term not exceeding three years. If in any probate proceeding it should appear that any heir or devisee is barred by reason of the provisions of the act to take real property which said heir or devisee would have been entitled to take, but for the provision of said act, the court, instead of ordering distribution of such real property to said heir or devisee, shall order a sale thereof and the proceeds thereof shall be distributed to said heir or devisee in lieu of said real property. Any real property thereafter acquired in fee in violation of the provisions of the act shall escheat to the state of California upon a proceeding instituted by the attorney-general as by the act provided. The provisions Feb. 1927.] MOTT v. CLINE. 441

of the act do not apply to any real property acquired after its passage in the enforcement of any lien or in the satisfaction of any lien existing upon said real property at the time of the adoption of the statute so long as such real property remains the property of the alien acquiring the same by the enforcement of his lien. Any leasehold or other interest in real property less than the fee acquired in violation of the provisions of the act shall escheat to the state. It was but a short time before the act of 1913 became a law that the lease contract was executed. In fact, it was executed during a time when there was much public discussion in the state as to the wisdom of the passage of Alien Land Laws. The term of the lease did not commence until some months after the act of 1913 became effective.

[1] The applicability of the Alien Land Laws to subjects of China is challenged by respondent herein. We have not been cited to nor have we found any state or federal decision construing the Alien Land Laws with respect to the treaty with China. [2] It is contended that while the Alien Land Laws of the state do not violate any treaty agreement between the United States and the Empire of Japan, a different situation exists as to subjects of China by force of the language used in the treaty agreement with that power, it being different in phraseology from the treaty agreement with Japan. It is argued that by the provisions of articles II and III of the existing treaty between the two nations, proclaimed October 5, 1881 (22 U. S. Stats. at Large, p. 826), subjects of China cannot be brought within the inhibitory provisions of the Alien Land Laws of the state without effecting a violation of our treaty agreement. This argument is based mainly upon the clauses of said articles II and III, which accord to Chinese subjects, as therein classified, the rights, privileges, immunities, and exemptions which are accorded to "the citizens and subjects of the most-favored nation." Said articles in their order read:

"Article II.

"Chinese subjects, whether proceeding to the United States as teachers, students, merchants or from curiosity . . . , and Chinese laborers who are now in the United States shall be allowed to go and come of their own free will and accord, and shall be accorded all the rights, privi- 442 MOTT v. CLINE. [200 Cal.
leges, immunities and exemptions which are accorded to citizens and subjects of the most favored nation. (Italics supplied.)

"Article III.

"If Chinese laborers, or Chinese of any other class, now either permanently or temporarily residing in the territory of the United States, meet with ill treatment at the hands of any other persons, the Government of the United States will exert all its power to devise measures for their protection and to secure to them the same rights, privileges, immunities and exemptions as may be enjoyed by the citizens or subjects of the most favored nation, and to which they are entitled by treaty." (Italics supplied.)

A supplemental treaty concerning commercial intercourse and judicial procedure was ratified July 19, 1881 (22 U. S. Stats. at Large, 828), by the two nations, but it guarantees no rights to the subjects of China to own or occupy real property. The riotous conditions that existed in some of the states of the Pacific slope as a protest against Chinese immigration, which was pouring into this state and other coast states in menacing numbers, are matters of state history, and were considerations inseparably connected with our treaty agreements with China and were the motive of much subsequent legislation. Years prior to the ratification of said treaty the people of the state of California adopted a new constitution (1879), in which it was provided that no native of China could ever thereafter become an elector of this state. The adoption of statutes withholding from the Chinese rights and privileges granted to the subjects of other nations followed. Conflicts involving violence to the person were not infrequent. As residents of this state they were in disfavor. Their testimony in the earlier years of our statehood was not receivable in courts of justice in certain trials and proceedings. It was claimed by their government that they were denied the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the federal and state constitutions. At the time the treaty of 1881 was adopted they were not generally engaged in agricultural pursuits and were not landholders, but mainly contract laborers who had been brought into this country originally by the builders of the great transcontinental railroads to be used as laborers in the construction of said railroads. They settled in districts which Feb. 1927.] MOTT v. CLINE. 443

became greatly overpopulated and later engaged in the laundry business or mercantile pursuits. It was not until later that they engaged in the vegetable and garden truck business, or had any contact with the soil as producers for themselves, and there was no threatened menace by reason of their ownership of or dominion over the agricultural lands of the state until a much later period. The proclamation and preamble of the treaty very clearly show that it was meant as a purely immigration and labor treaty, and it must be construed with respect to the situation that existed at the time it was ratified and the difficulties sought to be corrected as shown by the treaty itself and by modifications that were agreed upon in supplemental treaties. The proclamation declares it to be a treaty for the modification of existing treaties between the two nations "by providing for the future regulation of Chinese immigration into the United States." The preamble, which is declaratory of the motive and object of the treaty, provides: "Whereas the Government of the United States, because of the constantly increasing immigration of Chinese laborers to the territory of the United States, and the embarrassments consequent upon such immigration, now desires to negotiate a modification of the existing treaties," etc. At this time Chinese subjects were expressly forever denied the privileges of citizenship and, as they claimed, the equal protection of the laws. The rights, privileges, and immunities accorded them by treaty were such only as were specified by the treaty, to wit, personal security and protection in their property rights against spoliation. The treaty is no more than it purports to be, and, aside from extending certain privileges and immunities to students, travelers, and other persons who were temporarily within our territory, was intended primarily for the protection of alien Chinese laborers. No rights as to the acquirement, enjoyment, or occupancy of agricultural lands were granted by the treaty. That subject was not germane to the purposes of the treaty. The subsequent exclusion of Chinese immigration into this country was foreshadowed by the proclamation of the treaty and eligibility as owners of the soil finds not the slightest guaranty in either the spirit or language of the treaty. Any other conclusion would be repugnant to the conditions that were terminated by the treaty agreement. 444 MOTT v. CLINE. [200 Cal.

[3] In 1894, "in view of the antagonism and much deprecated and serious disorders to which the presence of Chinese laborers has given rise in certain parts of the United States," the governments of China and the United States, by a convention covenant (28 U. S. Stats. at Large, p. 1210), agreed upon articles whereby it was provided that the coming, except under conditions not affecting the decision of the question before us, of Chinese to the United States should be absolutely prohibited for a period of ten years, and said agreement should continue for another like period unless either government should at the expiration of the first ten-year period give formal notice to the other of its termination. Said articles further provided that Chinese then in the United States under the treaty of 1881, "shall have for the protection of their persons and property all rights that are given by the laws of the United States to citizens of the most favored nation, excepting the right to become naturalized citizens." No right to acquire real property is conferred thereby. By consenting to the ineligibility of its subjects to become citizens, China also conceded the right of the United States to define or fix the status of its subjects as to the acquisition of agricultural lands. The "most-favored nation" clause is not used in a sense materially different from the language used in our treaty with Japan, entered into in 1911, which treaty has been construed as not giving to the subjects of that empire any right to own or lease agricultural land. [4] The right to carry on trade or to own or lease and occupy houses, manufactories, warehouses, and shops, or to lease land for residential and commercial purposes, or to do anything necessary for trade, cannot be said to include the right to own or lease, or to have any title to, or interest in, land for agricultural purposes. (Terrace v. Thompson, 263 U. S. 197 [68 L. Ed. 255, 44 Sup. Ct. Rep. 15], and cases therein cited; Webb v. O'Brien, 263 U. S. 313 [68 L. Ed. 318, 44 Sup. Ct. Rep. 112]; Porterfield v. Webb, 195 Cal. 71 [231 Pac. 554].) It may well be said here, as was said in Webb v. O'Brien, supra, construing the treaty with Japan, "The treaty gives no permission to enjoy, use or have the benefit of land for agricultural purposes. The privileges granted by the act are carefully limited to those prescribed in the treaty. The act as a whole evidences Feb. 1927.] MOTT V. CLINE. 445

a legislative intention that ineligible aliens shall not be permitted to have or enjoy any privilege in respect of the use or benefit of land for agricultural purposes. And this view is supported by the circumstances and negotiations leading up to the making of the treaty." In addition, it may be said that the interpretation which we have given the treaty has for many years been acquiesced in by the nation affected thereby.

[5] The Alien Land Acts are not repugnant to any article of the federal or state constitutions and do not impinge upon the treaty agreements existing between this nation and China.

We have set forth at some length the history of our treaty agreements and our commercial, industrial, and political relations with China and her subjects, together with the constitutional and statutory regulations bearing upon those subjects, to show that there is no substantial ground upon which a claim may be based that it was the intention of either the state or federal governments to grant to native-born subjects of China the right of acquiring the title to agricultural lands. The spirit and scheme of our state and federal regulations are repugnant to such a claim.

[6] We now come to a consideration of the question whether or not the Alien Land Acts are retroactive so far as the option is concerned. This question depends largely upon the legislative intent and upon whether or not the objects sought to be attained are within the police power of the state. There is no direct language upon this point, but there is general language which necessarily implies an intention to prevent an executory contract from ripening into a fee simple. Section 2 of the act of 1920 provides: "All aliens other than those mentioned in section one of this act may acquire, possess, enjoy and transfer real property, or any interest therein, in this state, in the manner and to the extent and for the purpose prescribed by any treaty now existing between the government of the United States and the nation or country of which such alien is a citizen or subject, and not otherwise." Section 7 provides: "Any real property hereafter acquired in fee in violation of the provisions of this act by any alien mentioned in section two of this act, . . . shall escheat to, and become and remain the property of the State of California . . ." 446 MOTT v. CLINE. [200 Cal.

(Italics supplied.) The treaty confers no right to acquire a fee in agricultural lands. An assumption of rights not granted by the treaty is a violation of the act. It was the purpose of the act to cut off *instanter* the right to thereafter acquire the fee. It is not to be presumed from a consideration of the evil to be remedied that the state so tied its hands as to be utterly helpless and unable to protect itself against the passing of large and fertile acreages of land into the hands of ineligible aliens, who, in anticipation of adverse legislation, should contract with respect to the exercise of an option to purchase said lands. If this were so, the fee of the state's best lands could have been acquired by the persons proscribed between the day the act was introduced in the legislature and the day on which it became effective. Surely sovereignty is not so impotent as to be unable to protect itself from a menacing situation.

[7] "The police power being in its nature a continuous one, must ever be reposed somewhere, and cannot be barred or suspended by contract or irrepealable law. It cannot be bartered away even by express contract." (5 Cal. Jur. 689; *Laurel Hill Cemetery v. San Francisco*, 152 Cal. 464 [14 Ann. Cas. 1080, 27 L. R. A. (N. S.) 260, 93 Pac. 70].) It is to be presumed that parties contract in contemplation of the inherent right of the state to exercise unhampered the police power that the sovereign always reserves to itself for the protection of peace, safety, health and morals. Its effect cannot be nullified in advance by making contracts inconsistent with its enforcement. (Freund on Police Power, sec. 556; 5 Cal. Jur. 778; *Louisville & N. R. R. v. Mottley*, 219 U. S. 467 [34 L. R. A. (N. S.) 671, 55 L. Ed. 297, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 265, see, also, *Rose's U.S. Notes*]; *Philadelphia, B. & W. Ry. Co. v. Schubert*, 224 U. S. 603 [56 L. Ed. 911, 32 Sup. Ct.

Shrader v. Steubenville etc. Co., 84 W. Va. 1 [99 S. E. 207].) Both Cline, the owner of the land, and Ah Chue, the optionee, entered into the contract charged not only with notice of what the state had the right to do in the exercise of the police power, but also with notice of what it had done by constitutional and statutory laws affecting ineligible persons and what in all probability it was most likely to do under a situation that was becoming acute as to alien ownership of land.

[8] It has been firmly settled by the decisions of both federal and state courts (Webb v. O'Brien, supra; Terrace v. Thompson, supra; Porterfield v. Webb, supra, and many others to the same effect) that the adoption of the Alien Land Acts was a lawful exercise of the police power. In fact, it is the exercise of that power in its highest and truest sense. The ownership of the soil by persons morally bound by obligations of citizenship is vital to the political existence of a state. It directly affects its welfare and safety. In Terrace v. Thompson, supra, the following observation is quoted approvingly: "It is obvious that one who is not a citizen and cannot become one lacks an interest in, and the power to effectually work for the welfare of the state, and, so lacking, the state may rightfully deny him the right to own and lease real estate within its boundaries. If one incapable of citizenship may lease or own real estate, it is within the realm of possibility that every foot of land within the state might pass to the ownership or possession of non-citizens." (Terrace v. Thompson, 274 Fed. 841, 849.) It is further declared by the high authority last cited that "the allegiance of the farmers to the state directly affects its strength."

"At common law, aliens, though not permitted to take land by operation of law, may take by the act of the parties; but they have no capacity to hold against the state, and the land so taken may be escheated to the state." (Webb v. O'Brien, supra; Doe v. Robertson, 11 Wheat. (U. S.) 332 [6 L. Ed. 488, see, also, Rose's U. S. Notes]; Suwa v. Johnson, 54 Cal. App. 119 [203 Pac. 414].)

[9] It is appellant's view that the option provision has been rendered void by section 10 of the act of 1920, which makes it a crime punishable as a misdemeanor or felony to conspire to effect a transfer of real property or an inter- 448 MOTT v. CLINE. [200 Cal.

est therein in violation of the law. This is the only act that is made a public offense and penalized by imprisonment or fine or by both. (In re Akado, 188 Cal. 739 [207 Pac. 245].) The exaction imposed for all other violations of the act inhibiting transfers is that the conveyance is rendered void as to the state and the real property escheats to the state upon action brought by the attorney-general or district attorney of the county in which the violation occurs. (People v. Cockrill, 268 U. S. 258 [69 L. Ed. 944, 45 Sup. Ct. Rep. 490].) Our statute follows the common law as to the escheat proceedings. [10] It cannot be said that Ah Chue violated any provision of the conspiracy section.

The acts are designed to keep agricultural lands in the control of citizens or such persons as are eligible to citizenship under the state and federal laws. The option agreement was entered into at a time when there was, and for a number of years prior thereto had been, a very general public demand for the adoption of laws rendering persons ineligible to citizenship incapable of owning, leasing, or occupying agricultural lands within this state. The act of 1913 was introduced in the legislature as a proposed law about the same day the lease containing the option was signed. It became a law within a few months thereafter, and before the ten-year term, as stipulated in the lease, commenced. Ah Chue occupied the lands nine years and four months before making an assignment of the option. Within this period the initiative act of 1920 was adopted. Had the assignment of the option been made to an ineligible person we would hold that the assignment violated the act of 1920 and consequently a court of equity would not compel specific performance of an act forbidden by law. Likewise we are of the opinion that the ineligible alien could not have compelled a conveyance to himself. (Ales v. Epstein, 283 Mo. 434 [222 S. W. 1012]; Case v. Kelly, 133 U. S. 21 [33 L. Ed. 513, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 216, see, also, Rose's U. S. Notes]; Suwa v. Johnson, supra.) The policy of the state forbade it. But here we have quite a different question presented. The ineligible person is not attempting to transfer any right or interest whatsoever to another who is likewise ineligible. The diverted stream is turned back into its legitimate channel. Respondent Mott, who is Ah Chue's assignee, is a person eligible to exercise all the Feb. 1927.] MOTT v. CLINE. 449

rights and privileges of citizenship. As a matter of fact, the assignment is in furtherance of the purposes of the law. The fact that Ah Chue may receive a portion of the proceeds of the transaction is not at all material to the question. All of the Alien Land Laws that have been passed provide that if an ineligible alien is an heir or devisee under a will the real property may not be distributed to him, but it must be sold and the proceeds distributed to such ineligible alien. The law does not mean to confiscate property, but to escheat it to the state in cases of violations of the acts in a proceeding brought for that purpose.

It was held in *Suwa v. Johnson, supra*, supported by a citation of authority from almost every jurisdiction of the nation, that under statutes forbidding ownership of land by aliens an alien grantee takes a defeasible estate free from attack by anyone except the government in escheat proceedings. (See, also, *Estate of Yano*, 188 Cal. 645, 650 [206 Pac. 995]; *In re Akado*, 188 Cal. 739, 742 [207 Pac. 245]; *Fairfax v. Hunter*, 7 Cranch (U. S.), 602 [3 L. Ed. 453]; *Phillips v. Moore*, 100 U. S. 208 [25 L. Ed. 603].) It is a governmental affair, a transfer made in violation of the act being defeasible as to the state only. It is quite well settled that in case title to real property is defeasible by reason of the alienage of the owner and said owner before the power of the state is invoked in an escheat proceeding conveys the property to a person eligible to hold it, as Mott unquestionably is, the infirmity of title is removed. (*Manuel v. Wulff*, 152 U. S. 505 [38 L. Ed. 532, 14 Sup. Ct. Rep. 651]; *State ex rel. Atkinson v. World Real Estate Commercial Co.*, 46 Wash. 104 [89 Pac. 471]; *Oregon Mtg. Co., Ltd., v. Carstens*, 16 Wash. 165 [35 L. R. A. 841, 47 Pac. 421]; 2 Cor. Jur. 1053.)

A case quite in point is *State ex rel. Atkinson v. World Real Estate Commercial Co. et al., supra*. There an ineligible alien conveyed real property to the World Real Estate Commercial Company in violation of the provisions of the constitution of the state of Washington. The court, in passing upon an objection similar to the one made here, held that an alien holding lands in that state by purchase under a defeasible title, subject to attack on the part of the state, might by deed transfer a good title to a third person entitled to receive and hold it, provided no pro-

200 Cal.—29 450 MOTT v. CLINE. [200 Cal.
ceeding had theretofore been taken by the state for the purpose of declaring a forfeiture or escheat. Numerous other cases are to the same effect.

[11] It is next contended that the option was nonassignable. Inasmuch as the contract contains no features of personal trust or confidence reposed in any of the parties and requires nothing more than a mere routine of paying money, it is assignable. (25 Cal. Jur. 509; 5 Cor. Jur. 852; *Prichard v. Kimball*, 190 Cal. 757 [214 Pac. 863].) The option provision is clearly severable from all other provisions of the lease and no injury could possibly come to the owner and lessor by receiving the cash purchase price, to wit, $4,100, from the optionee's assignee, rather than from the optionee. No features of trust or confidence, as pointed out in *Prichard v. Kimball*, *supra*, exist in the instant case. Under the laws of this state "property of any kind may be transferred, except as otherwise provided by this article [Article 2 of Div. 2, Pt. 4, Tit. 4, Ch. 1, Civil Code]." (Civ. Code, sec. 1044.) The assignability of an option in the exercise of a general property right is not made an exception to the general rule by any code provision.

[12] But we are of the opinion that respondent cannot prevail because of his failure to make a proper and seasonable tender. It is admitted that the only tender made by respondent was the amount stated in the option, to wit, $4,100. In other words, no proportionate amount of rent was tendered by either the lessee or his assignee for the use of the premises for a period of about four months, or one-third of the year 1923. "When the hiring of a thing is terminated before the time originally agreed upon, the hirer must pay the due proportion of the hire for such use as he has actually made of the thing, unless such use is merely nominal, and of no benefit to him." (Civ. Code, sec. 1935.) That the section of the code above cited has direct application to the instant case, there can be no doubt. (*Diepenbrock v. Luiz*, 159 Cal. 716 [Ann. Cas. 1912C, 1084, L. R. A. 1915C, 234, 115 Pac. 743].) Resolving all other controverted questions of law in favor of respondent, the failure to tender a proportionate amount of rent for the use made of the premises by the lessee for a period of about four months prior to the offer to purchase furnishes a complete bar and answer to his demand for specific per- Feb. 1927.] MOTT v. CLINE. 451

formance of the option provision. Section 1935 of the Civil Code is an innovation upon the common-law rule, which was to the effect that rent will not be apportioned in case of the termination of the lease before the rent is due. A number of the states of the Union have, however, adopted statutes similar to ours with reference to the apportionment of rent.

[13] Respondent further contends that appellant, Cline, by a failure to object to the insufficient amount of the tender must be deemed to have waived any objection he might have made on that ground. (Sec. 2076, Code Civ. Proc.; sec. 1501, Civ. Code.) An examination of the record, however, does not show that respondent sought to introduce any evidence of such waiver. The record is silent as to what actually took place when the insufficient tender was made. The burden is on the party asserting a waiver to introduce evidence of the facts constituting it (25 Cal. Jur. 932; 40 Cyc. 269), and respondent did not meet this burden. If Cline, in fact, waived the insufficiency of the tender, respondent had the right to seek from a court of equity a decree of specific performance directing a conveyance to him upon payment of the stipulated purchase price and the proportionate amount of rent due. (Bradford v. Fidelity Sav. & Loan Society, 177 Cal. 247 [170 Cal. 404]; Hixson v. Hovey, 18 Cal. App. 230 [122 Pac. 1097]; Colton v. Oakland Bank of Savings, 137 Cal. 376 [70 Pac. 225]; Shermaster v. California Bldg. etc. Co., 40 Cal. App. 661 [181 Pac. 409].) If Cline did not waive the insufficiency of the tender, respondent lost all rights under the option, and cannot be given the relief sought by a modification of the judgment of the trial court or in any other manner. The offer by its very terms was to continue only during the life of the lease, and since the insufficient tender of $4,100, in the absence of circumstances establishing a waiver, did not constitute an acceptance, the effect of holding that respondent now has the right to compel specific performance would be to extend the option beyond the time when it was to terminate by the express agreement of the parties.

Questions going to the sufficiency of the evidence and the findings and questions of pleading, more or less of a techni- 452 CALIFORNIA NAT. BANK v. LIME ETC. Co. [200 Cal.

The judgment is reversed.

APPEAL from an order of the Superior Court of Sacramento County denying a motion to set aside a default in the preparation and filing of a proposed bill of exceptions. George F. Buck, Judge Presiding. Reversed.

The facts are stated in the opinion of the court.

Thomas B. Leeper for Appellants.

Devlin & Devlin, Hinsdale & Pigott and T. A. Farrell for Respondent.

THE COURT.—This is an appeal by certain of the above-named defendants from an order of the superior court of the county of Sacramento denying a motion for relief under section 473 of the Code of Civil Procedure from a default in the preparation, service, and filing of a proposed bill of exceptions to be used on an appeal from the judgment entered in the above-entitled action.

The judgment herein was entered on May 20, 1925. An order denying a motion for new trial was made on July 1, 1925, and notice thereof served on the appellants on July 3, 1925. Thereafter and on application the trial court granted to the appellants certain extensions of time within which they might serve and present their proposed bill of exceptions. When read together the several orders of the court below extended the appellants' time approximately three months from the last day prescribed by statute (sec. 650, Code Civ. Proc.) for the preparation and service of a proposed bill of exceptions. On October 6, 1925, the proposed bill was served on the respondent, together with a notice of motion for relief from default in said service. The respondent had previously indorsed a reservation of all objections to service of the proposed bill upon a copy of the last order extending time to the appellants. 454 CALIFORNIA NAT. BANK v. LIME ETC. Co. [200 Cal.

A reading of the record and the briefs herein discloses that the appellants' delay in the service of the proposed bill of exceptions is traceable to their reliance upon the orders of the court below extending time therefor and to an asserted "physically impossible" task of completing the proposed bill within the statutory period.

[1] The rule of law is well settled that motions for relief from default under the remedial provisions of section 473 of the Code of Civil Procedure are addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court and an appellate court will not, in the absence of a clear showing of abuse in the exercise thereof, disturb the action of the court below. It is the policy of the law to favor, wherever possible, a hearing on the merits. (Waybright v. Anderson, ante, p. 374 [253 Pac. 148].) Moreover, an appellate court is much more disposed to affirm an order when the result is to compel a hearing upon the merits than it is when the default is allowed to stand. (O'Brien v. Leach, 139 Cal. 220 [96 Am. St. Rep. 105, 72 Pac. 1004].)

[2] Counsel for the appellants herein undoubtedly proceeded under the erroneous theory that the trial court's jurisdiction and power to grant extensions of time for the preparation and service of a proposed bill of exceptions was without statutory limitation. Section 1054 of the Code of Civil Procedure, however, expressly declares that the court below may not, without the consent of the adverse party, extend time for more than thirty days for the performance of certain acts. It has been repeatedly held by this court that the provision in section 650 of the Code of Civil Procedure providing that the draft of a bill may be prepared and served within ten days after notice of entry of an order denying a motion for new trial "or such further time as the court in which the action is pending, or a judge thereof, may allow" does not authorize the court to grant an indefinite extension of time for the preparation and service of the draft, but is to be read in connection with the restriction contained in said section 1054 upon the amount of time which may be allowed by the court. (Cameron v. Arcata R. R. Co., 129 Cal. 279 [61 Pac. 955].)

[3] The record herein is such as to indicate that the trial court was inclined to deny the appellants' motion to Feb. 1927.] CALIFORNIA NAT. BANK v. LIME ETC. Co. 455

set aside the default solely for the reason that said default was the result of a mistake of law upon the part of appellants' counsel, the lower court being of the opinion that it was not "within the power of the court to relieve against the situation that has been so created." In so concluding the trial court cannot be said to have exercised that discretion vested in it by section 473 of the Code of Civil Procedure. [4] While it was not within the power of the trial court to grant to the appellants herein, without the consent of the adverse party, an extension of time in excess of thirty days for the preparation and service of their proposed bill of exceptions (sec. 1054, Code Civ. Proc.), nevertheless, having exceeded its jurisdiction by extending the time therefor beyond the statutory limitation and the appellants having in good faith relied on such void orders extending time, the case would seem to fairly come within the remedial provisions of section 473 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The authorities indicate that a mistake of law may be availed of in support of a motion for relief under said code section for the provisions thereof are broad enough to include such mistakes within their scope. (*Waite v. Southern Pac. Co.*, 192 Cal. 467, 471 [221 Pac. 204].) In view of the appellants' reliance on the trial court's orders extending time for the preparation and service of the proposed bill and the apparent inability to complete and present the same within the statutory period and authorized extensions thereof, we are of the opinion that a case is presented which would require the lower court in the sound exercise of its discretion to grant the relief prayed for. This being so, the appellants' motion to be relieved from default in the preparation and service of their proposed bill of exceptions was improperly denied by the court below.

For the foregoing reasons the order appealed from is reversed, and the cause is remanded to the trial court with directions to grant the relief sought by the appellants herein. KNOCK v. INDUSTRIAL ACC. COM. [200 Cal.

CARRIE M. KNOCK et al., Petitioners, v. INDUSTRIAL ACCIDENT COMMISSION, etc., et al., Respondents.

[1] WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION ACT—OVEREXERTION IN HIGH ALTITUDE—COMPENSABLE INJURY.—Upon an application for compensation for the death of an employee, where the Industrial Accident Commission finds that the death was caused by acute dilatation of the heart and that said condition was due to a previous diseased condition being precipitated by the employee's situation in a higher altitude than that to which he had long been accustomed, and the evidence shows that such exposure was connected with a marked degree of overexertion at such higher altitude and was immediately attendant upon the occupation of the employee at the time of his heart attack, it is error to conclude that the injury is not compensable.

[2] ID.—"PRECIPITATION" OF CRISIS.—The term "precipitation" means to hasten the occurrence of an event; and where an employee's death, although arising from an existing heart trouble, is found to have been "precipitated" by overexertion in the course of his employment, an industrial liability exists.

[3] ID.—FINDINGS—EVIDENCE.—In such a case, if a finding of the Industrial Accident Commission that "said situation and precipitation did not constitute an injury arising out of the employment" is a finding of ultimate fact, it cannot be sustained under the undisputed evidence, and if it is a conclusion of law, it is not sustained under the authorities.

Warren H. Pillsbury for Respondent United States Fidelity and Guaranty Corporation.

G. C. Faulkner for Respondent Industrial Accident Commission.

RICHARDS, J.—This is a petition for a writ of review wherein the petitioners seek to have reviewed and annulled a decision of the Industrial Accident Commission. The petitioners were refused an award in their favor upon their application for such award against Montezuma Ranch Company, Inc., and its insurance carrier, United States Fidelity and Guaranty Corporation, the former of those having been the employer of one Malcolm A. Knock, deceased, at the time of his death, and who was alleged to have come to his death through injuries received while such employee of said corporation and in the course of his employment. The undisputed evidence presented before the Commission at the time of the hearing upon said application showed that said Malcolm A. Knock had for several years prior to the time of his death been an employee of the Montezuma Ranch Company, Inc., the principal place of his employment and activities thereunder being upon the properties of said corporation at Collinsville, along the lower reaches of the Sacramento River. During the month of June, 1924, he was required by his employer to go to McArthur, California, for the purpose of inspecting certain peat lands in that region in order to gain information as to the best methods of handling such lands in the interest and for the benefit of his employer. Mr. Knock, with a companion, reached McArthur on the afternoon of June 27, 1924, and proceeded immediately to make the investigation of the lands in question. The elevation of McArthur and of the region traversed by Mr. Knock in the course of such investigation is about thirty-three hundred feet above sea level, and the investigation which he was there to make required that he and his companions should walk over the peat lands in question for a distance of some miles. The walking was difficult and laborious, at times over rough country and at others wading through mud and water which frequently came over the tops of their high leather boots, or requiring them to jump over small sloughs, or travel lands trodden with cattle 458 Knock v. Industrial Acc. Com. [200 Cal.

tracks and trails, or walk along levees built of peat and volcanic ash material upon which it was difficult to maintain a footing. The party walked rapidly at first, but after going some distance it was observed that Mr. Knock was lagging behind and that he complained of feeling unwell. The party returned to the place where the night was to be spent and where Mr. Knock, still complaining of feeling unwell, retired early, but spent a bad night, and early the next morning, left by automobile for Klamath Falls, upon reaching which a doctor was sent for, who undertook to minister to Mr. Knock, and who advised that he be taken to a lower altitude. After another night, during which his condition grew much worse, the party left the following morning to take the train at Ashland, but on the way Mr. Knock died in the automobile, and his body was shipped from Ashland to his home for burial, no autopsy being held.

Upon the hearing before the Commission it was further shown in evidence that prior to taking said trip Mr. Knock had been to all appearances an unusually healthy and active man and that if he was afflicted with any heart trouble prior thereto that fact was unknown to himself, his friends, and his family. Upon the hearing before the Commission the only evidence bearing upon the existence of any previous disorder of that nature consisted in reports received from two physicians, resident in Honolulu, who had examined Mr. Knock several years previously, one of whom, whose examination was casual, thought he had been consulted as to some heart condition, but could give no details; and the other of whom, whose examination was thorough, stated that there were no indications of any heart affection at that time. The only other evidence upon that subject was that of Dr. Johnson, whose report upon the case of Mr. Knock as it came under his observation at Klamath Falls was submitted; of Dr. Lund, who had known the deceased personally and intimately for years, but who had never been consulted by him professionally, and who, after reading the report of Dr. Johnson, gave it as his opinion that the deceased had died from acute dilatation of the heart, probably caused by his overexertion at a high altitude, but that there may have been some previous heart trouble of which the deceased was not conscious and which the overstrain had brought out; of Dr. Walker, who had known the deceased in his lifetime Feb. 1927.] KNOCK v.

but had never attended him professionally, but who also, after reading Dr. Johnson's report, together with a statement of the agreed facts attending the presence of the deceased at McArthur and his sudden attack of heart illness there, gave it as his opinion that the cause of the latter's death was acute dilatation of the heart as the result of the high altitude and of his overexertion; of Dr. Kilgore, a medical expert appointed by the Commission, who, upon such report of Dr. Johnson and the statement of agreed facts, gave it as his opinion that the deceased must have been affected with a previous heart affection, with respect to which the altitude or exertion, or both together, may possibly have acted as the last straw to precipitate his collapse a few days, weeks, or months sooner than would otherwise have happened. Upon the foregoing state of the record the Commission made and filed its findings and decision, as follows:

"Findings of Fact.

"1. Malcolm A. Knock was employed as a ranch manager on and about June 27, 1924, at Collinsville, California, by defendant Montezuma Ranch Co., Inc. At said time said employer's insurance carrier was United States Fidelity and Guaranty Company, and both employer and employee were subject to the provisions of the Workmen's Compensation, Insurance and Safety Act of 1917 [Stats. 1917, p. 831]. 2. The said employee died on June 29, 1924, his death being caused by acute dilatation of the heart. 3. Said heart condition was due to a previous diseased condition being precipitated by the employee's situation in a higher altitude than that to which he had long been accustomed, but such situation and precipitation did not constitute an injury arising out of the employment. Exposure to a high altitude of a weakened heart, does not constitute an industrial injury.

"Award.

"It is ordered that the applicants take nothing herein."

A petition for rehearing was presented before the Commission and was granted, wherein Dr. Kilgore was called as a witness and repeated in substance the statements made in his former report. Dr. Harbaugh, assistant medical director of the Industrial Accident Commission, was also called and examined, after the submission to him of the same 460 Knock v. INDUSTRIAL ACC. COM. [200 Cal.

matters upon which the evidence of Dr. Kilgore had been predicated. He testified that, in his opinion, the cause of Mr. Knock's death was acute dilatation of the heart; that in his opinion the previous condition of the heart of the deceased could not have been normal, even though he was unaware of any existing heart trouble, and that it was his opinion that in view of such previous condition the over-exertion of the deceased was the direct and precipitating factor in causing his death. Upon resubmission a further rehearing was denied. Whereupon the petitioners herein applied to this court for a writ of review.

[1] We are of the opinion that the Commission, upon the undisputed evidence presented before it, as above set forth, was correct in its findings that the death of said decedent was caused by acute dilatation of the heart, and that "said heart condition was due to a previous diseased condition being precipitated by the employee's situation in a higher altitude than that to which he had long been accustomed"; but we are also of the opinion that the Commission was in error in its conclusion that "such situation and precipitation did not constitute an injury arising out of the employment." The further statement of the Commission that "exposure to a high altitude of a weakened heart does not constitute an industrial injury" must be read and understood in connection with the undisputed evidence in the case, which shows that such exposure was connected with a marked degree of overexertion at such high altitude, and that such overexertion was immediately attendant upon the employment and occupation in which the decedent was engaged at the time of his attack with said heart trouble.

[2] The term "precipitation" employed by the Commission in its foregoing findings is a term of well-known signification, meaning the act of precipitating or "to hasten the occurrence of" an event; "the causing to happen or come to a crisis suddenly, unexpectedly or too soon." (Webster's New International Dictionary, subject "Precipitation.") In other words, to precipitate is to accelerate a casualty. The foregoing finding of the Commission to the effect that the death of the decedent was precipitated by his situation in a higher altitude than that to which he had long been accustomed must therefore be read in the light of the foregoing definition, and also in the light of the undisputed Feb. 1927.] KNOCK v. INDUSTRIAL ACC. COM. 461

evidence in the case, and when so read the case, in our opinion, is brought directly within the principle declared by this court in the case of *G. L. Eastman Co. v. Industrial Acc. Com.*, 186 Cal. 587, 594 [200 Pac. 17, 20], wherein this court said: "If the disability, although arising from a chronic heart trouble, was brought on by any strain or excitement incident to the employment, the industrial liability still exists. Acceleration or aggravation of a pre-existing disease is an injury in the occupation causing such acceleration. [Citing cases.] It can hardly be doubted under this rule that if decedent's incapacity to drive his truck was caused by a heart attack brought on by exertion or sudden shock or excitement incident to his employment on the highway, recovery could be had." The cases from other jurisdictions which have similar statutes relating to industrial injuries are in full accord with the foregoing views. The case of *Patrick v. J. B. Ham Co.*, 119 Me. 510 [13 A. L. R. 427, 111 Atl. 912], is an illuminating case, wherein the applicant was stricken with a cerebral hemorrhage while lifting some bags of corn, and wherein it was shown that the decedent prior to the occurrence of his injury was suffering from diseased arteries, predisposing him to cerebral hemorrhage. The supreme court of Maine in such a case, and after much citation of authority, held that the fact that the employee was suffering from diseased arteries, predisposing him to cerebral hemorrhage, was of no consequence in the case, and that the fact that he might or would have died in a week or a year from cerebral hemorrhage was immaterial in view of the fact that his actual stroke occurred while he was directly engaged in the over-exertion which his immediate employment required. The case of *Peoria Co. v. Industrial Acc. Board*, 279 Ill. 352 [116 N. E. 651], is also much in point, the court in that case holding, after a review of many cases both in this country and in England, that "even where a workman dies from a pre-existing disease, if the disease is aggravated or accelerated under certain circumstances which can be said to be accidental, his death results from injury by accident," and is therefore compensable, citing 1 Bradbury on Workmen's Compensation, 385; Elliott on Workmen's Compensation, 7th ed., 9, and cited cases. [3] It is urged, however, on behalf of the respondents, that the further finding 462 Knock v. Industrial Acc. Com. [200 Cal.

of the Commission that "said situation and precipitation did not constitute an injury arising out of the employment" is a finding of ultimate fact and as such is sufficient to sustain its conclusion that the resultant death of the decedent did not constitute an industrial injury and that the applicants were not entitled to an award. If the foregoing finding of the Commission is to be held to be a finding of ultimate fact, it cannot be sustained in view of the undisputed evidence in the case as above set forth; and if the foregoing finding of the Commission is to be construed as being a conclusion of law it cannot be sustained under the foregoing authorities. The statement of the Commission that "exposure to a high altitude of a weakened heart does not constitute an industrial injury" may be conceded to be true; but when such exposure is directly attended with an overexertion on the part of the employee, which the undisputed evidence shows and which the findings when reasonably interpreted discloses, the case is taken out of the rule and becomes an industrial injury.

It follows from the foregoing that the conclusion and award of the Commission "that the applicants take nothing herein" was erroneous and that its decision to that effect must be and the same is hereby annulled. The application for an award is remanded to the Commission for further proceedings in accord with the views expressed in this opinion.

POSTAL TELEGRAPH-CABLE COMPANY, a Corporation, Petitioner, v. RAILROAD COMMISSION OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA et al., Respondents.

[1] TELEGRAPH COMPANIES—FEDERAL FRANCHISE—ACT OF 1866.—Under the act of Congress passed July 24, 1866, to "Aid in the construction of telegraph lines," etc. (14 Stats. at Large, 221, c. 230; Rev. Stats., secs. 5263–5268), where a telegraph company files its written acceptance of the restrictions and obligations of the statute, the rights and privileges conferred upon the company thereunder constitute a federal franchise and the company has the right to construct, maintain, and operate its lines over and along the public roads and highways of the United States, while kept up and maintained as such, irrespective of whether mail is actually being carried thereon, either by way of city letter-carriers or in rural delivery.

[2] Id.—AUTHORITY OF CONGRESS—AUTHORITY OF STATE.—As Congress has authority to say that a telegraph company may construct and operate its telegraph over public roads and highways of the United States, a state has no authority to say it shall not be done, and cannot, by a specific statute, prevent the company from placing its lines along the post-roads, or stop the use of them after they are placed there.

[3] Id.—GOVERNMENTAL FUNCTION.—By said act of Congress, and its acceptance by a telegraph company, the latter becomes an instrumentality of the United States in carrying out its governmental functions, and an agency of the federal government for the transaction of its postal business, and an agent of interstate and foreign commerce.

[4] Id.—RIGHT OF STATE TO REGULATE TELEGRAPH COMPANIES.—The state and its municipalities have the right to impose upon a telegraph company, under the police power, reasonable regulations with reference to the manner of the exercise by it of the rights conferred by the national government, but these powers are regulatory, and not prohibitory; and the state cannot so interfere with its operation, even under the assumed guise of the exercise of the

police power, as to work a prohibition of any part of its business; and the regulations of the state must not be arbitrary, unreasonable, nor such as have the effect of excluding the company from the state or forbidding it to carry on its business therein.

[5] Id.—AUTHORITY OF FEDERAL FRANCHISE—UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION.—The authority for a "federal franchise" possessed by a telegraph company which has accepted the provisions of the act of Congress of July 24, 1866, to "Aid in the construction of telegraph lines," etc., is the provision of the United States constitution giving Congress the power to establish postoffices and post-roads; and under this provision the power of the national government is exclusive, subject to the right of the state, under its police power, to make certain reasonable regulations as to the manner in which the business of the telegraph company shall be conducted.

[6] Id.—ORDER OF RAILROAD COMMISSION—SUSPENSION OF POWER OF TELEGRAPH COMPANY.—An order of the Railroad Commission that a telegraph company, which has accepted the provisions of the act of Congress of July 24, 1866, and which is maintaining an interstate telegraph business, cease and desist from the operation of its line for intrastate business unless and until it shall have secured a certificate from the Commission that the present and future public convenience and necessity require, or will require, such operation, does not find support in the exercise of the police power of the state to regulate, but amounts to an attempt to exercise a power to prohibit, which violates the company's rights under the federal constitution and said act of Congress.

[7] Id.—HIGHWAYS OF STATE—RIGHT OF TELEGRAPH COMPANY TO USE—SECTION 536, CIVIL CODE.—The rights acquired by a telegraph company, by accepting and availing itself of the provisions of section 536 of the Civil Code, are vested rights which the constitutions, both state and federal, protect; and they cannot be taken away by the state, even though the legislature should repeal the section, or by the people through a constitutional provision.

[8] Id.—ACCEPTANCE OF STATE'S FRANCHISE.—The finding of the Railroad Commission of the physical fact that a telegraph company is maintaining and operating its lines of telegraph over the roads and highways of the state establishes, as a matter of law and of fact, the proposition that it has accepted and owns a state franchise for that purpose, which was offered to it by section 536 of the Civil Code.

[9] Id.—CONSTRUCTION OF NEW LINES—PUBLIC UTILITIES ACT—CERTIFICATE OF PUBLIC CONVENIENCE AND NECESSITY.—The constitutional amendments of 1911 and the "Public Utilities Act" of 1911 cannot be held to have required a telegraph company, which had prior to the passage of said measures accepted the pro- Feb. 1927.] POSTAL TEL.-CABLE CO.

The facts are stated in the opinion of the court.

Willard P. Smith and Max Thelen for Petitioner.

Carl I. Wheat, Arthur T. George and Reginald L. Vaughan for Respondents.

WASTE, C. J.—The petitioner, Postal Telegraph-Cable Company, constructed a line from Niland, through Brawley, Imperial, and El Centro, to Calexico, known as its Imperial Valley extension, and opened offices in the places mentioned for the transaction of a general telegraph business. The respondent Railroad Commission, of its own motion, and assuming to act under the provisions of section 50, subdivisions (a) and (b), of the Public Utilities Act (Stats. 1915, p. 115; amended Stats. 1917, p. 168), instituted an investigation into the construction of the line and the business being carried on over it. After due hearing, it made an order that the Telegraph Company cease and desist from the operation of the line for intrastate business unless and until it shall have secured a certificate that the present and future public convenience and necessity require, or will require, such operation. This proceeding is brought to determine the validity of that order.

The Postal Telegraph-Cable Company, at times hereinafter referred to as the Telegraph Company, a California

200 Cal.—30 466 POSTAL TEL.-CABLE CO. v. RAILROAD COM. [200 Cal.

corporation, is one of several telegraph and telephone companies doing a competitive business in this state. It is part of the "Mackay System," which operates telegraph and cable companies throughout the United States and foreign countries. Its predecessors first entered California in 1886, by a telegraph line extending from the Canadian boundary south through the states of Washington and Oregon, and thereafter constructed and extended their lines generally throughout the state. In 1908 the predecessor companies conveyed all their property in California to this petitioner, and it has carried on all subsequent construction and operation in the state. Apart from the period during which the country was engaged in the World War, there has been a continual increase in the Telegraph Company's facilities, equipment, and lines in California. During 1924 a line from Los Angeles to Dallas, Texas, and running through Niland was completed. Prior to the construction of this interstate line, the petitioner's nearest point to the Imperial Valley was at Redlands, 124 miles away. The extension, which is physically connected with the line at Niland, is forty-six and a half miles in length. It is substantially constructed and, except for a distance of one and a half miles, runs along the county and state highways.

It is not now claimed by the respondent Commission that the line from Niland to Calexico was unlawfully constructed, and it is conceded that it was being lawfully operated for interstate business and the transmission of government messages. Respondent admits that neither it nor the state, whose agent it is, can demand a certificate of convenience and necessity as a prerequisite to the construction or operation of a telegraph line within the state for the doing of interstate business; and that any order of the Commission requiring such a certificate, or any statutory enactment purporting to require a certificate, would be violative of the commerce clause of the federal constitution. Respondent further concedes that the state cannot require a certificate of public convenience and necessity as a prerequisite to the construction of a line physically connected to an interstate line, even though potentially usable for intrastate purposes, for such line, regardless of where constructed, would also be potentially usable for interstate business. These con- Feb. 1927.] POSTAL TEL.-CADLE CO. V. RAILROAD COM. 467

cessions remove from any possible application to this proceeding the provisions of section 50 (a) of the Public Utilities Act, which require certificates from the Railroad Commission in certain cases of construction by specified classes of public utilities.

But, with so much conceded, the respondent contends that as to intrastate telegraph business, authority inheres in the state to require compliance with a proper and reasonable exercise of the state's police power. It therefore invokes the provisions of section 50 (b) of the Public Utilities Act, which provides that certain named types of public utilities, including telegraph corporations, shall not exercise "any right or privilege under any franchise or permit hereafter granted, or under any franchise or permit heretofore granted but not heretofore actually exercised, or the exercise of which has been suspended for more than one year, without first having obtained from the Commission a certificate that public convenience and necessity require the exercise of such right or privilege; provided, that when the Commission shall find, after hearing, that a public utility has heretofore begun actual construction work and is prosecuting such work, in good faith, uninterruptedly and with reasonable diligence in proportion to the magnitude of the undertaking, under any franchise or permit heretofore granted but not heretofore actually exercised, such public utility may proceed, under such rules and regulations as the Commission may prescribe, to the completion of such work, and may, after such completion, exercise such right or privilege; and provided, further, that this section shall not be construed to validate any right or privilege now invalid or hereafter becoming invalid under any law of this state."

By reason of the concessions of the respondent and its present contentions, the sole issue to be considered in this proceeding may be thus stated: Can the Postal Telegraph-Cable Company, after it has lawfully constructed its line from Niland to Calexico, for the construction of which no certificate from the Railroad Commission was necessary, be forced to let the line stand idle, in so far as California intrastate business is concerned, unless and until it secures a certificate of public convenience and necessity for the trans- 468 POSTAL TEL.-CABLE CO. v. RAILROAD COM. [200 Cal.

action of such business? In answer to this question, the petitioner contends that the provisions of the Public Utilities Act relied on by the respondent (if applied to it) and the order of the Commission violate its rights under the federal constitution and the statutes enacted by Congress pursuant thereto. In making this contention, it relies, first, upon the fact that it is lawfully within this state and carrying on its business under a "federal franchise," from which it contends that it is beyond the power of the state to in any way interfere with its operation. [1] That petitioner possesses a federal franchise is beyond question. Section 8 of article I of the constitution of the United States provides: "The Congress shall have power . . . to establish Post Offices and Post Roads." By an act to "Aid in the Construction of Telegraph Lines and to Secure to the Government the Use of the Same for Postal, Military, and Other Purposes," passed July 24, 1866 (14 Stats. at Large, 221, c. 230; Rev. Stats., secs. 5263–5268), Congress provided (sec. 1) that any telegraph company then organized, or which might thereafter be organized, under the laws of any state in the Union, "shall have the right to construct, maintain and operate lines of telegraph through and over any portion of the public domain of the United States, over and along any of the military or post-roads of the United States which have been or may hereafter be declared such by Act of Congress. . . ." It is further provided in the act (sec. 2) "that telegraphic communications between the several departments of the Government of the United States and their officers and agents shall, in their transmission over the lines of any of said companies, have priority over all other business, and shall be sent at rates to be annually fixed by the Postmaster-General." Before any telegraph company may exercise any of the powers or privileges conferred by the act, such company is required (sec. 4) to file its written acceptance with the postmaster-general of the restrictions and obligations thereby imposed. Petitioner filed its written acceptance of the act with the postmaster-general on August 4, 1908, since which time it has been entitled to all the rights and privileges granted thereby. These rights and privileges constitute its federal franchise. (Western Union Tel. Co. v. Hopkins, 160 Cal. 106, 110, 113 [116 Pac. Feb. 1927.] POSTAL TEL.-CABLE Co. v. RAILROAD COM. 469

557].) By a subsequent act, Congress declared that all public roads and highways, while kept up and maintained as such, are post-routes. (Act March 1, 1884, 23 Stats. at Large, 3, c. 9.) Petitioner, therefore, has the right to construct, maintain, and operate its lines over and along the public roads and highways of the United States, while kept up and maintained as such, irrespective of whether mail is actually being carried thereon, either by way of city letter-carriers or in rural delivery. This right cannot be denied to it. (Western Union Tel. Co. v. Hopkins, supra; Western Union Tel. Co. v. Lakin, 53 Wash. 326, 335 [101 Pac. 1094, 1098]; Town of Essex v. New England Tel. Co., 239 U. S. 313 [60 L. Ed. 301, 36 Sup. Ct. Rep. 102, see, also, Rose's U. S. Notes].) [2] As Congress has authority to say that a telegraph company may construct and operate its telegraph over these lines, the state can have no authority to say it shall not be done, and cannot, by any specific statute, prevent the company from placing its lines along the post-roads, or stop the use of them after they are placed there. (Western Union Tel. Co. v. Massachusetts, 125 U. S. 530, 548, 554 [31 L. Ed. 790, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 961].)

[3] The decisions appear to be uniform to the effect that, by the act of Congress, and its acceptance by petitioner, the latter became an instrumentality of the United States in carrying out its governmental functions. (Western Union Tel. Co. v. Visalia, 149 Cal. 744, 746 [87 Pac. 1023].) Having accepted the benefits and burdens of the act, it thereby became an agency of the federal government for the transaction of its postal business, and an agent of interstate and foreign commerce. (State v. Western Union Tel. Co., 43 Mont. 445 [117 Pac. 93].)

[4] The respondent seems to understand the petitioner as arguing that the effect of its "federal franchise" is to give it an absolute right to carry on its intrastate telegraph business, to the complete exclusion of the police power of the state. Petitioner makes no such contention, as, indeed, it cannot. It concedes the right of the state and its municipalities to impose upon a telegraph company, under the police power, reasonable regulations with reference to the manner of the exercise by it of the rights conferred by the 470 POSTAL TEL.-CABLE CO. v. RAILROAD COM. [200 Cal.

national government. (Town of Essex v. New England Tel. Co., supra; Carver v. State, 11 Ga. App. 22 [74 S. E. 556]; Western Union Tel. Co. v. Lakin, supra.) These powers are, however, regulatory, and not prohibitory, and this distinction renders tenable the contention petitioner is here making that the state cannot so interfere with its operation, even under the assumed guise of the exercise of the police power, as to work a prohibition of any part of its business. In Western Union Tel. Co. v. Lakin, supra, the court said: "The power of the city was limited to its right to regulate the use of the privilege granted by Congress. . . . Beyond this it had no power to go." Regulations of the state must not be arbitrary, unreasonable, nor such as have the effect of excluding the company from the state or forbidding it to carry on its business therein. A state cannot so exclude or prohibit either directly or indirectly. In Western Union Tel. Co. v. Superior Court of Sacramento County, 15 Cal. App. 679, 688 [115 Pac. 1091, 115 Pac. 1100], it was said that, notwithstanding the fact that the state has no power under the indicated circumstances to exclude such telegraph corporations from the right or privilege of carrying on the business for which they are formed within its borders, it may impose upon such corporations, "as it may upon all corporations of whatever kind or nature, organized and existing under the laws of another state, reasonable regulations, and to that end prescribe and require certain reasonable prerequisites to the exercise of the authority conferred on them by Congress to do business in such state," with the limitation, of course, that "no state will be permitted, whether under the guise of regulation or otherwise, to enact any legislation the effect of which would or might, practically, be to prevent them from doing business in such state, or in effect result in an attempt on the part of such state to regulate commercial intercourse between its citizens and those of other states, or to control the transmission of all telegraphic correspondence within its own jurisdiction."

When the act of Congress granting telegraph companies the right to construct, maintain, and operate their lines over the public domain (July 24, 1866, supra) first came before the supreme court of the United States, it was carefully Feb. 1927.] POSTAL TEL.-CABLE Co. v. RAILROAD COM. 471

examined by it in order to determine whether or not Congress had power to prevent the states from placing obstructions in the way of the usefulness of the telegraph. It was decided that the statute was a proper exercise of the power of Congress over interstate commerce, and the power to establish postoffices and post-roads, and that "the statute, in effect, amounts to a prohibition of all state monopolies in this particular. It substantially declares, in the interest of commerce and the convenient transmission of intelligence from place to place by the government of the United States and its citizens, that the erection of telegraph lines shall, so far as state interference is concerned, be free to all who will submit to the conditions imposed by Congress, and that corporations organized under the laws of one state for constructing and operating telegraph lines shall not be excluded by another from prosecuting their business within its jurisdiction." (Pensacola Tel. Co. v. Western Union Tel. Co., 96 U. S. 1, 11 [24 L. Ed. 708].) A statute of the state of Florida, which purported to grant a monopoly to a particular telegraph company in certain state territory, to the exclusion of all other telegraph companies, was held unconstitutional as to those telegraph corporations which had accepted the act of Congress of July 24, 1866, for the reason that it interfered with interstate commerce and with the transmission of intelligence from place to place by the government. The opinion of the court in the Pensacola case was cited in a comparatively recent decision of the same court as establishing beyond question the validity, and pointing out the general purposes of the act of 1866, and it was held that a state has no authority to say that a telegraph company may not operate lines constructed over postal routes within its borders. (Town of Essex v. New England Tel. Co., supra, p. 320.)

[5] We take it to be, therefore, conclusively settled that the authority for the "federal franchise" possessed by the petitioner is the provision of the United States constitution, supra, that "the Congress shall have power . . . to establish Post Offices and Post Roads." Under this provision, the authorities seem to as conclusively establish that the power of the national government is exclusive, subject to the right of the state, under its police power, to make cer- 472 POSTAL TEL.-CABLE Co. v. RAILROAD COM. [200 Cal.

tain reasonable regulations as to the manner in which the business of the telegraph company shall be conducted. [6] The order here sought to be annulled amounts to an injunction entirely suspending the doing of intrastate business over the Imperial Valley extension of the Telegraph Company's line. It does not, therefore, find support in the exercise of the police power to regulate, but amounts to an attempt to exercise a power to prohibit. For this reason, the order of the Commission and the provisions of section 50 (b) of the Public Utilities Act, if applied to the petitioner here, violate petitioner's rights under the federal constitution and the act of Congress which give effect to its provisions relating to postoffices and post-roads. (Western Union Tel. Co. v. Massachusetts, supra, p. 554.)

[7] For another reason the respondent may not now demand the certificate of public convenience and necessity from petitioner before it can carry on its intrastate business. Section 536 of the Civil Code provides: "Telegraph or telephone corporations may construct lines of telegraph or telephone lines along and upon any public road or highway, along or across any of the waters or lands within this state, and may erect poles, posts, piers, or abutments for supporting the insulators, wires, and other necessary fixtures of their lines, in such manner and at such points as not to incommode the public use of the road or highway or interrupt the navigation of the waters." This section constitutes a grant of a franchise which the state offered, and petitioner accepted by the construction of its lines. The rights acquired by the Telegraph Company, by accepting and availing itself of the provisions of the section, are vested rights which the constitutions, both state and federal, protect. They cannot be taken away by the state, even though the legislature should repeal the section, or by the people through a constitutional provision. (Western Union Tel. Co. v. Hopkins, supra, p. 119 et seq.; Postal-Telegraph-Cable Co. v. Los Angeles, 160 Cal. 129, 131 [116 Pac. 566]; In re Keppelmann, 166 Cal. 770, 773 [138 Pac. 346].) [8] The finding of the respondent Commission of the physical fact that petitioner was maintaining and operating its lines of telegraph over the roads and highways of the state establishes, as a matter of law and of fact, the proposition that Feb. 1927.] POSTAL TEL.-CABLE Co. v.

it has accepted and owns a state franchise for that purpose, which was offered to it by section 536, *supra*. (Postal-Telegraph-Cable Co. v. Los Angeles, 164 Cal. 156–160 [128 Pac. 19].)

[9] Respondent takes the position that, conceding that it may have been true when section 536 was enacted that the right to operate telegraph lines was implied as a necessary adjunct to the right to construct, the situation was changed by the adoption, in 1911, of amendments to the state constitution, and the enactment by the legislature of the "Public Utilities Act," which went into effect March 23, 1912 (Stats. 1911, Extra Session, pp. 18, 43), and which expressly added (sec. 50 [b]) a new requirement, i. e., a certificate of public convenience and necessity from the Railroad Commission as a condition precedent to the exercise by the public utility of its franchise rights. This statute, it admits, did not prevent the continuation of public utility facilities already in operation, without a certificate; but it contends that the continuing right to construct telegraph lines offered by the state, under section 536, did not give the petitioner an unexpressed, but nevertheless vested, right to operate new lines constructed after the Public Utilities Act went into effect. We cannot agree with this contention. Neither the constitutional amendments nor the passage of the Public Utilities Act worked the change contended for by the respondent. In view of the nature of the business of the Telegraph Company, and the broad and unrestricted terms of the offer contained in section 536, which has not been withdrawn or modified, we find no ground for the contention that each act of constructing a telegraph line, or an extension of service, was to constitute an acceptance *pro tanto*. The offer was intended to be, and was, accepted in its entirety as made. Petitioner has now exactly the same rights under its state franchise that it has had from the time it constructed and began to maintain and operate its first telegraph line within the borders of the state. The grant, resulting from the acceptance of the state offer, constituted a contract between the Telegraph Company and the state, secured by the constitution of the United States against impairment by any state legislation.

The conclusion we have reached renders it unnecessary to consider the other points made by the petitioner.

The order is annulled.

In the Matter of the Application of JAMES A. MAKINGS for a Writ of Habeas Corpus.

[1] FISH AND GAME—REGULATION OF SHIPPING OF CRABs—SECTION 626, PENAL CODE—CONSTITUTIONAL LAW—CRIMINAL LAW.—Section 626 of the Penal Code is not unconstitutional in permitting the shipment of crabs from one to other districts into which the state has been divided by said section, but prohibiting such shipment into the territory of the state outside said districts.

[2] Id.—SECTION 25½, ARTICLE IV, CONSTITUTION—PURPOSE OF.—The purpose of section 25½ of article IV of the constitution, providing that the legislature may divide the state into fish and game districts and enact such laws for the protection of fish and game therein as it may deem appropriate to the respective districts, was to remove the former restriction of article IV, section 25, subdivision 33, which prohibited the enactment of a local law where a general law could be made applicable; and it in nowise limits the sovereign power of the state over fish and game, or the legislature to legislate concerning the same, but, on the contrary, it increases the legislative discretion by authorizing local laws on the subject.

[3] Id.—DIVISION OF STATE INTO DISTRICTS—REGULATION OF CERTAIN DISTRICTS—POWER OF LEGISLATURE.—There is nothing in the language of section 25½ of article IV of the constitution to indicate that the legislature is not given power to make regulations applicable to two or more districts into which it is authorized by said section to divide the state, without making the same applicable to the state generally.

[4] Id.—REMEDIAL LEGISLATION—STATUTORY CONSTRUCTION.—Section 25½ of article IV of the constitution is remedial in character Feb. 1927.] IN RE MAKINGS. 475

and should be given a liberal construction; and in construing the section the court should consider the subject matter with which it deals in its endeavor to ascertain the true meaning of the language used.

[5] Id.—PURPOSE OF CONSTITUTION.—It was the purpose of the amendment of the constitution by the adoption of section 25½ of article IV to take from local authorities the right to regulate the fish and game of the state and to invest such power exclusively in the legislature, and it was designed to clothe the legislature with ample power to adequately protect the fish and game of the state.

[6] Id.—PURPOSE OF LEGISLATION—PROTECTION AND USE OF FISH AND GAME.—One of the purposes determining the legislature in the enactment of laws with reference to the fish and game of the state is to permit the largest use of fish and game compatible with the reasonable protection thereof.

APPLICATION for a Writ of Habeas Corpus to secure release of petitioner charged with unlawfully shipping crabs. Writ discharged.

The facts are stated in the opinion of the court.

Puter & Quinn and Marc F. Morrison for Petitioner.

B. D. Marx Greene, Ralph W. Scott and Henry C. Greer, District Attorney, for Respondent.

CURTIS, J.—Petition for writ of habeas corpus. The petitioner is in the custody of the constable of Sausalito township, county of Marin, under a warrant of arrest issued out of the justices' court of said township upon a complaint charging that on or about the twelfth day of March, 1926, he unlawfully transported and carried crabs from fish and game district number 1½ into the county of Marin, state of California.

Under the authority conferred upon the legislature by section 25½ of article IV of the constitution the state has been divided into some sixty-seven fish and game districts. By section 628 of the Penal Code it is provided: "(c) Every 476 IN RE MAKINGS. [200 Cal.
person who ships or offers for shipment or who transports or carries any species of crab from fish and game districts one and one-half, five, six, seven, seven 'A,' eight and nine, either to a point outside of the state or into any part of the state other than in districts one and one-half, five, six, seven, seven 'A,' eight and nine, or who holds any crabs in live cars within said fish and game districts, is guilty of a misdemeanor.

"For the purposes of this act a live car shall be any box, crate or pen in which live crabs are kept."

[1] The seven districts mentioned in said subdivision (c) are situated in the northwestern part of the state and they form one compact and contiguous body of land and water. No part of the county of Marin is in any of said districts. It is apparent, therefore, that the complaint against petitioner charges a violation of this subdivision (c) of section 628 of the Penal Code. It is the contention of petitioner that this section of the Penal Code, in so far as it attempts to prohibit the transportation or shipment of crabs from the fish and game districts therein enumerated into any other part of the state other than into said seven districts named in said section is unconstitutional and void. His contention is based upon the fact that a number of fish and game districts are grouped together in said section and a general prohibition as to shipment of crabs therefrom is made or attempted to be made applicable to the territory composed of all said districts, with the result that crabs from any one of said districts may be shipped into any or all of the other districts of said group, but cannot be shipped into any other part of the state. Petitioner admits that it is perfectly legal for the legislature to provide that crabs shall not be shipped from one fish and game district into any other part of the state, but contends that the legislature is without power, by grouping a number of districts together or in any other manner, to provide that crabs or any other kind of fish or game may be shipped from one district into another district or into a group of districts and prohibit their shipment into the remaining districts of the state.

[2] By section 25½ of article IV of the constitution, "The legislature may provide for the division of the state into fish and game districts, and may enact such laws Feb. 1927.] IN RE MAKINGS. 477

for the protection of fish and game therein as it may deem appropriate to the respective districts." This section was incorporated into the constitution by an amendment adopted by the people in 1902, and "The obvious purpose of this amendment was to remove the former restriction of article IV, section 25, subdivision 33, which prohibited the enactment of a local law 'where a general law can be made applicable,' and in nowise limits the sovereign power of the state over fish and game, or of the legislature to legislate concerning the same. On the contrary, it increases the legislative discretion by authorizing local laws on the subject." (*Paladini v. Superior Court*, 178 Cal. 369, 372 [173 Pac. 588]; *In re Marincovich*, 48 Cal. App. 474, 483 [192 Pac. 156].)

[3] Petitioner asserts that by this amendment to the constitution the legislature is given authority to divide the state into fish and game districts and make any other legislation applicable to any one of said districts, but that it has no power to make regulations applicable to two or more of said districts without making the same apply to the state generally. We find nothing in the language of this constitutional provision that would indicate that it should be given such a narrow construction. Neither is petitioner's contention supported by any of the authorities cited in the argument of counsel or in the briefs filed herein. The cases relied upon by petitioner for this purpose, in so far as this state is concerned, are *Paladini v. Superior Court*, 178 Cal. 369 [173 Pac. 588], *In re Cencinino*, 31 Cal. App. 241 [160 Pac. 167]; *In re Marincovich*, 48 Cal. App. 474 [192 Pac. 156], and *In re Mascola*, 25 Cal. App. 92 [142 Pac. 903]. The Paladini case, as we have before noted, decided, among other things, that the obvious purpose of section 25½ of article IV "was to remove the former restriction of article IV, section 25, subdivision 33, which prohibited the enactment of a local law 'where a general law can be made applicable,' and in nowise limits the sovereign power of the state over fish and game, or of the legislature to legislate concerning the same. On the contrary, it increases the legislative discretion by authorizing local laws on the subject." In the Cencinino case the court held that by this constitutional amendment the power theretofore exercised 478 IN RE MAKINGS. [200 Cal.
by counties and other local authorities to regulate fish and game had been transferred from such authorities to the legislature and the sole power to protect the fish and game of the state was now conferred upon the legislature. In *In re Marincovich, supra*, it was contended that section 636 of the Penal Code, which sought to prohibit the use of a certain kind of fishing net in fish and game district number 20 was unconstitutional as special and local legislation. It was held that section 25½ of article IV of the constitution, citing the Paladini case as authority, had removed certain restrictions against special and local legislation by specially authorizing local legislation for the protection of fish and game. In the Mascola case the petitioner was charged with a violation of the penal statute prohibiting the use of a trawl net for fishing in fish and game district number 6. This statute made it unlawful to use such a net in district number 6 and in the waters of Monterey Bay. It was claimed that the statute was illegal for the reason that it included not only district number 6 but the waters of Monterey Bay, which were included in and formed a part of district number 5. The court held that even conceding that that part of the statute referring to Monterey Bay was beyond the powers of the legislature to enact, as it was an attempt to legislate as to a part only of an established fish and game district, its illegality would not affect the provisions of the statute referring to district number 6, of which the petitioner was charged with a violation. Petitioner also relies upon a number of authorities of other jurisdictions, particularly the cases of *Jonesboro, etc., v. Adams*, 117 Ark. 54 [174 S. W. 527], and *State v. Higgins*, 51 S. C. 51 [38 L. R. A. 561, 28 S. E. 15]. The former of these cases was decided by the supreme court of Arkansas and the latter by the supreme court of South Carolina. These authorities are of little assistance to us for the reason that in neither of these states is there a constitutional provision similar to section 25½ of article IV of our constitution.

[4] This section of the constitution is remedial in character and should be given a liberal construction. "It is well settled that a remedial statute must be liberally construed, so as to effectuate its object and purpose. Although due regard will be given the language used, such an act Feb. 1927.] IN RE MAKINGS. 479

will be construed, when its meaning is doubtful, so as to suppress the mischief at which it is directed, and to advance or extend the remedy provided, and bring within the scope of the law every case which comes clearly within its spirit and policy. Clearly, the remedial effect of provisions should not be impaired by construction, . . . " (23 Cal. Jur. 801.) In construing this section of the constitution the court should consider the subject matter with which it deals in its endeavor to ascertain the true meaning of the language used. [5] As we have already seen, it was the purpose of this amendment to the constitution to take from local authorities the right to regulate the fish and game of the state and to invest such power exclusively in the legislature. In so doing the powers of the legislature to protect the fish and game of the state were increased over those previously entrusted to that body. As we read the section, we think it most apparent that its purpose was to clothe the legislature with ample power to adequately protect the fish and game of the state. This was to be accomplished by authorizing the legislature to divide the state into fish and game districts and to enact such laws for the protection of the fish and game as the legislature might deem appropriate for the respective districts. The fish and game of the state are made up of various kinds and species, differing from each other in so many respects that it would be difficult, if not impossible, to enumerate such differences. On account of this great variety of kind and species it was necessary that the regulations adopted by the legislature for the protection of the fish and game be in some measure commensurate with the various kinds and species of fish and game existing in the different parts of the state. Very often in a given territory there may exist a number of different varieties of fish and game, each requiring special legislation in order that they may be properly protected. It may be necessary on account of the peculiar and varied conditions under which the deer in this district are found to divide the area into a number of different game districts in order to properly protect the deer found therein. On the other hand, the conditions under which the quail in this territory are found appear to be the same in the several parts of this territory. It is necessary, however, on account of the deer therein, to divide 480 IN RE MAKINGS. [200 Cal.
this territory into a number of districts. Such a regulation would not be necessary when it comes to the protection of quail, but after the territory has been divided into the several districts for the protection of the deer, there is nothing in this constitutional provision which prevents the legislature from enacting one general regulation as to quail throughout said territory and make it applicable to all the districts therein. In our opinion a reasonable construction of section 25½ of article IV clearly implies that the power to pass such an enactment has been left to the discretion of the legislature.

[6] There are also other considerations which might determine the legislature in the enactment of laws, the purpose of which is to protect the fish and game of the state. One of such considerations is the desire on the part of the legislature to permit the largest use of fish and game compatible with the reasonable protection thereof. The legislature undoubtedly found it necessary to divide the territory comprising the seven districts enumerated in subdivision (c) of section 628 of the Penal Code into seven districts in order to adequately protect all the fish and game found therein. It further found that to permit the crabs taken from the waters within such territory to be shipped into and used in the several districts comprising the same would not endanger the permanent supply of crabs produced in said waters, but to permit the crabs of said territory to be shipped generally throughout all parts of the state would result in their depletion and possibly in their final destruction. Under such conditions it was undoubtedly within the power of the legislature to enact such legislation as would protect the crabs of said district and at the same time to permit the use of the crabs produced therein by the largest possible number of people of the state. It is conceded by petitioner that it would have been perfectly legal for the legislature to have provided that crabs caught in any one of said districts should not be shipped or transported out of the district in which they were caught. Under such a regulation petitioner would have had no right to transport crabs from said district number 1½, or from any of the other districts into the county of Marin. How is he damaged or injured by the present law which permits the crabs from district number 1½ to be used in the other dis- Feb. 1927.] IN RE MAKINGS. 481

tricts of said territory as well as in district number 1½? Petitioner claims that he is discriminated against by being denied the right to ship crabs out of said district number 1½, while the people in the other districts are given this right. He would be discriminated against to the same extent by a statute prohibiting the shipment of crabs out of district number 1½. He concedes that this would be legal because the legislature has the right to pass such legislation. As we have already shown, the legislature also has the right to prohibit the shipment of crabs from the territory comprising said seven districts. It follows, therefore, that such discrimination, if it can be called such, is not illegal.

It is well established in this state that the legislature has most extensive powers over the fish and game within its jurisdiction. As was said by this court in *Ex parte Maier*, 103 Cal. 476, 483 [42 Am. St. Rep. 129, 37 Pac. 402, 404]: "The wild game within a state belongs to the people in their collective, sovereign capacity; it is not the subject of private ownership, except in so far as the people may elect to make it so; and they may, if they see fit, absolutely prohibit the taking of it, or any traffic or commerce in it, if deemed necessary for its protection or preservation, or the public good. To this extent it is conceded that the state may go. But it is contended that to go further, and prohibit the sale of game lawfully killed elsewhere and brought here as private property is in effect to destroy private property, and that this is going beyond a proper exertion of the police power. While it is true that the power to regulate is not the power to destroy, in its absolute sense, it is, nevertheless, true that the right to regulate frequently and as a necessary sequence carries with it the right to so control and limit the use or enjoyment of private property as to amount to its destruction."

This language has been frequently referred to with approval (*People v. Haagen*, 139 Cal. 115 [72 Pac. 836]; *Ex parte Kennke*, 136 Cal. 527 [89 Am. St. Rep. 177, 69 Pac. 261]; *In re Phoedovius*, 177 Cal. 238, 241 [170 Pac. 412]; *Geer v. State of Connecticut*, 161 U. S. 519, 527 [40 L. Ed. 793, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 600, see, also, *Rose's U. S. Notes*]). In view of these considerations we are firmly of the opinion that the regulation enacted by subdivision

200 Cal.—31 482 ESTATE OF GRACEY. [200 Cal.
(c) of section 628 of the Penal Code does not contravene any provision of the constitution and that it is a legal and valid enactment of the legislature. It follows, therefore, that petitioner's imprisonment is legal and the writ should be discharged. It is therefore ordered that the petitioner be remanded and the writ discharged.

In the Matter of the Estate of R. GRACEY, Deceased. JAMES SHIELDS GRACEY, as Executor, etc., et al., Appellants, v. CITY OF MERCED (a Municipal Corporation), Respondent.

[1] ESTATES OF DECEASED PERSONS—HOLOGRAPHIC WILLS—CONFLICT OF LAWS—WITNESSES.—Although a holographic codicil to a will may be invalid under the law of the state where the testator was domiciled, by reason of the absence of witnesses to it, when offered for probate in this state its sufficiency is governed by the law here, which does not require witnesses to such document.

[2] ID.—PROBATE PROCEDURE—FOREIGN TESTATOR—PROPERTY IN THIS STATE.—Where a testator was domiciled out of the state and his estate is being probated in the place of his domicile, if his interest in the estate of another, consisting partly of real property being probated in this state, be determined, by the doctrine of equitable conversion, to be personal property, it should be delivered to his executor for distribution in accordance with the law of his domicile; but if it be determined that there is no equitable conversion, the property should be distributed under the laws of this state.

[3] ID.—EQUITABLE CONVERSION—INTENTION—SECTION 1338, CIVIL CODE. Whether an equitable conversion of real property into personal property is effected by the will of a deceased person depends upon the intent of the testator, as shown by the provisions of the will; and where there is no express direction, or intention so shown

3. See 6 Cal. Jur. 532; 6 R. C. L. 1069. Feb. 1927.] ESTATE OF GRACEY. 483

therefor, such conversion does not result, even though the executor is given a discretionary power to sell all or any of the real estate.

[4] Id.—CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION 1338, CIVIL CODE.—Section 1338 of the Civil Code, providing that when a will directs the conversion of real property into money, such property and all its proceeds must be deemed personal property from the time of the testator's death, is simply declaratory of the common law; and the doctrine rests on the principle that equity considers that as done which ought to have been done.

[5] Id.—CONSTRUCTION OF WILL—VESTING OF PROPERTY.—A provision of a will that "After the funeral expenses and bequests are paid, should there still remain any money or property of whatsoever nature I die possessed of, I give to" a named person, vests the title to real property of the estate in the person named at the moment of the death of the decedent.

[6] Id.—REAL ESTATE—SALE OF—CHARACTER OF PROCEEDS.—When it becomes necessary to sell a portion of the real property of a decedent to pay specific bequests, and the whole of such property is sold, the surplus beyond the amount required for the purposes mentioned retains its character as real estate for purposes of distribution.

[7] Id.—DOCTRINE OF EQUITABLE CONVERSION—PURPOSE.—The doctrine of equitable conversion is a device employed in equity to bring about equitable results, and it is invoked to accomplish the intention of the testator, and for the benefit of beneficiaries.

[8] Id.—CONSTRUCTION OF WILL.—A provision in a holographic codicil to the will of a deceased person that, "of all money or moneys derived from the sale of real estate to come to me from the estate of" a named decedent, "that is of all the net amount that may come to me from said estate, I bequeath" to certain named institutions, does not show an intent of the testator to accomplish an equitable conversion of the real property of the estate.

[9] Id.—USE OF WORD "BEQUEATH" INSTEAD OF "DEVISE."—The use of the word "bequeath" instead of "devise" in such codicil was sufficient to pass title to the real property where it appears that the codicil was holographic and that the testator was unacquainted with the technical meaning of the term "bequeath," and intended by its use that it should apply to the takers of real property as well as personal property.

[10] Id.—APPEAL ON JUDGMENT-ROLL ALONE—INTENDMENTS.—Where an appeal is on the judgment-roll alone and the evidence is not

7. See 6 Cal. Jur. 526; 6 R. C. L. 1066.
10. See 2 Cal. Jur. 691. 484 ESTATE OF GRACEY. [200 Cal.
before the appellate court, all intendments are in favor of the determinations of the trial court.

[11] ID.—CONSTRUCTION OF WILL.—A will should be so interpreted as to render it operative, if it be reasonably susceptible to such interpretation, to the end that the intention of the testator be given effect and that intestacy be avoided.

[12] ID.—BEQUEST TO CHARITIES—AMOUNT—VALUE OF ESTATE.—In fixing the amount of one-third of the estate of a decedent which may be distributed to charitable uses under section 1313 of the Civil Code, the aggregate estate, wherever situated, is to be taken into consideration; and where the evidence is not before the court on appeal, it will be assumed that the trial court in determining such question had sufficient competent evidence before it upon which to base its implied finding to the effect that the administration of the estate of the decedent in a foreign state had progressed to the point where no further costs of administration would accrue.

SHENK, J.—Robert Gracey died testate on the twenty-fifth day of September, 1913, in the state of Pennsylvania. At the time of his death he was and for many years prior thereto had been a resident of that state and left real and personal property therein. He also left property in California consisting of money in bank and other personal property

11. See 26 Cal. Jur. 883.
12. See 5 Cal. Jur. 14. Feb. 1927.] ESTATE OF GRACEY. 485

and an interest in the estate of Sarah Jane Thursby, then in course of probate in Merced County. Sarah Jane Thursby died testate in Merced County on the third day of February, 1913, leaving an estate in said county consisting of real and personal property. Her will, holographic in form, was admitted to probate in that county. After making provision for the payment of debts, expenses of last illness, and certain legacies, her will set forth the following residuary clause: "11th. After the funeral expenses and bequests are paid, should there still remain any money or property of whatsoever nature I die possessed of, I give to Robert Gracey of Pennsylvania." The will next contained the following provision: "12th. I appoint John Olcese of Merced, California, my executor, to carry out the provisions of this last will, and also give him power to sell all or any of my real estate or personal property without any order from court. . . ."

At the time of the death of Sarah Jane Thursby her estate consisted largely of real property, all situated in the state of California. During the course of the administration of her estate in Merced County it was determined that the personal estate, after payment of debts, funeral expenses, costs and expenses of administration, was insufficient to pay the bequests mentioned in her will and it was found necessary to sell a portion of the real estate in order to discharge said bequests. Instead of selling a portion of said real property for said purpose it was deemed for the best interests of the estate to sell the whole of said real property. After such sale a considerable sum of money, being the proceeds of the sale of said real property, remained for the benefit of the residuary legatee and devisee. The proper distribution to be made of this residuum forms the basis of this controversy.

On February 12, 1913, or nine days after the death of Sarah Jane Thursby, Robert Gracey, the said residuary legatee and devisee, while domiciled in the state of Pennsylvania, appended to his existing holographic will the following codicil, holographic in form: "Of all money or money[s] derived from sale of real estate to come to me from the estate of Sarah J. Thursby, deed. of Merced, California, that is of all the net amount that may come to me from said estate, I bequeath one-half thereof to the Public Library of Merced City, California, and the remaining one-half to be equally 486 ESTATE OF GRACEY. [200 Cal.
divided and distributed to Westminster College, mentioned in sec. 6 above, and the Boards of Home and Foreign Missions of the United Presbyterian [Church of North America] mentioned in secs. 2 and 5 above." The effect to be given to this codicil is the principal subject for determination on this appeal. Upon the death of Robert Gracey his last will was admitted to probate in the state of Pennsylvania and subsequently said will and codicil were admitted to probate in Merced County. James Shields Gracey was named executor in both jurisdictions. On proceedings to settle the final account and for distribution of the Gracey estate in Merced County the executor petitioned the court to turn over the entire California estate to the executor acting under the Pennsylvania administration. The City of Merced filed objections to said final account and also a cross-petition, in which it prayed that one-half of the amount of the estate in the hands of the California executor be paid to the City of Merced for and on behalf of its public library pursuant to the provisions of said codicil. After a hearing the court made an order in which the final account was settled and approved. The court found that the moneys on hand in the possession of the California executor were derived from the sale of the real estate in California devised to Robert Gracey, deceased, by the terms of the residuary clause contained in the will of Sarah Jane Thursby, deceased, and that the said moneys must be distributed as real estate in California according to the laws of California and not as personal property under the laws of Pennsylvania, the domicile of Robert Gracey, deceased. It was further found that the total net value of the estate of Robert Gracey, deceased, in California and elsewhere amounts to the sum of $65,509.59, and that under and pursuant to section 1313 of the Civil Code the sum of $21,836.53 is the total aggregate sum that can be bequeathed or devised to the said City of Merced, Westminster College, and the Boards of Home and Foreign Missions of the United Presbyterian Church. The court further found that the remainder of said property, to wit, the sum of $16,714.66 and certain other personal property not reduced to cash should be distributed to the executor under the Pennsylvania administration. The decree of final distribution was duly made and entered pursuant to the foregoing findings and determinations. From this decree the Feb. 1927.] ESTATE OF GRACEY. 487

executor under the Pennsylvania administration and the heirs of Robert Gracey, deceased, or their representatives, prosecute this appeal from that portion of the decree which orders distributed to the City of Merced in trust for the use and benefit of the public library of said city the sum of $10,918.27, to Westminster College the sum of $5,459.13 and to the Boards of Home and Foreign Missions of the United Presbyterian Church the sum of $5,459.13. The appeal is presented on the judgment-roll alone.

Two notices of appeal were filed, one on behalf of the executor under the Pennsylvania administration and the other on behalf of the heirs at law of Robert Gracey, deceased. By stipulation one record is presented and both appeals may be determined by one order. Rights of creditors are not here involved and all taxes and expenses of administration have been paid or provided for.

It is the contention of appellants that the court erred in holding that the assets which were on hand under the California administration were in legal effect real estate in the state of California at the time of the death of Robert Gracey, deceased, and in holding that the law of California was applicable to the distribution of the estate. It is their claim that the proceeds distributable under the California administration constituted personal property at the time of the death of Robert Gracey, deceased, by reason of an alleged equitable conversion of realty into personalty in both the wills of Sarah Jane Thursby and Robert Gracey and that the law of Pennsylvania should be applied to the distribution thereof. [1] The appellants alleged and proved the law of Pennsylvania to the effect that any holographic will or codicil devising or bequeathing property to charitable or public uses must be attested by at least two witnesses. The codicil here in question was not so attested and it is not questioned that tested by the law of Pennsylvania the said codicil would be invalid. But when the same was offered for probate in California its sufficiency as a valid codicil was governed by the law of this state (Civ. Code, sec. 1376). When so tested it was sufficiently proved, for in this state witnesses to a holographic will or codicil are unnecessary.

[2] The primary question for determination is whether an equitable conversion of the real estate in Merced County 488 ESTATE OF GRACEY. [200 Cal.
to personal property took place upon the death of either Sarah Jane Thursby or of Robert Gracey. It is conceded by the respondents that if it be held, contrary to the determination of the trial court, that the California estate of which Robert Gracey died seised was, in contemplation of law, personal property at the time of his death it would follow that all of said California estate should be delivered to the Pennsylvania executor to be distributed in accordance with the laws of Pennsylvania, with the inevitable declaration there that the said codicil is void. On the other hand, if it be determined that there was no such equitable conversion in either estate it would seem to follow that distribution should be made as ordered by the trial court. [3] It is the claim of the appellants that the will of Sarah Jane Thursby created an equitable conversion of all of her real property into personalty as of the date of her death pursuant to the provisions of section 1338 of the Civil Code, which provides that "When a will directs the conversion of real property into money, such property and all its proceeds must be deemed personal property from the time of the testator's death." It is conceded by the appellants that there is no express direction to the executor of the Thursby will to convert the real property into money, but it is insisted that from the whole scheme of the will it was the intention of the testatrix that the executor should do so. We do not so conclude. As necessarily conceded there was no such express direction, and we find nothing on the face of the will that imports an intention on the part of the testatrix that such conversion took place. It does not appear therefrom that such conversion was necessary in order that the intentions of the testatrix be carried out. [4] Section 1338 of the Civil Code is simply declaratory of the common law (Estep v. Armstrong, 91 Cal. 659 [27 Pac. 1091]) and the doctrine rests on the principle that equity considers that as done which ought to have been done. In Estate of Pforr, 144 Cal. 121 [77 Pac. 827], it was said at page 128: "Whether such conversion is effected depends upon the intention of the testator as gathered from the entire provision of his will. If it is apparent from its terms that it was his will that the estate be sold and the proceeds given to his beneficiaries, an equitable conversion results, even if the direction for the Feb. 1927.] ESTATE OF GRACEY. 489

sale is not imperative. (Dodge v. Pond, 23 N. Y. 69.) 'The question of conversion is a question of intention, and the real question is, Did the testator intend his land should be converted into money at all events before distribution?' (Wurtz v. Page, 19 N. J. Eq. 375.) Mr. Pomeroy (Equity Jurisprudence, sec. 1161) says: 'In fact the whole result depends upon the intention. If by express language, or by a reasonable construction of all its terms, the instrument shows an intention that the original form of the property shall be changed, then a conversion necessarily takes place.'" The doctrine of equitable conversion was invoked in the case of Janes v. Throckmorton, 57 Cal. 368, 382, and it was there said: "But the doctrine of equitable conversion is invoked by the defendant; and it is said, that as to the beneficiaries, the land, under the agreement, became personal estate, and their interest personal property. Dodge v. Pond, 23 N. Y. 69; Lynn v. Gephart, 27 Md. 547, and 2 Story's Eq. Jur., sec. 1214, are cited by defendant's counsel in support of this position. In Lynn v. Gephart, the Court cites the section from Story which reads thus: 'The inclination of courts of equity upon this branch of jurisprudence is not generally to change the quality of the property, unless there is some clear intention or act by which a definite character, either as money or as land, has been unequivocally fixed upon it throughout'; and, adds, that 'if this intention do not clearly appear, the property retains its original character.'" The citation of authorities to the same effect could be prolonged. From their consideration it cannot be said that under the Thursby will such conversion took place either by direction of the testatrix or by necessary or fair implication from the language used. The mere discretionary power to sell does not produce such result (White v. Howard, 46 N. Y. 162). [5] The language of the residuary clause in the Thursby will unquestionably had the effect of vesting the title to the real property in Robert Gracey at the moment of the death of Mrs. Thursby (Civ. Code, sec. 1341; Estate of Patterson, 155 Cal. 626 [132 Am. St. Rep. 116, 18 Ann. Cas. 625, 26 L. R. A. (N. S.) 654, 102 Pac. 941]; Estate of Benvenuto, 183 Cal. 382 [191 Pac. 678]).

[6] When it became necessary to sell a portion of said real property to pay specific bequests, and when the whole 490 ESTATE OF GRACEY. [200 Cal.
of said real property was sold, the surplus beyond the amount required for the purposes mentioned retained its character as real estate for purposes of distribution (2 Woerner on Administration, sec. 481; 24 C. J. 706).

[7] Nor do we think that any equitable conversion took place upon the death of Robert Gracey. As above indicated, the doctrine of equitable conversion is a device employed in equity to bring about equitable results. It is invoked to accomplish the intention of the testator and for the benefit of beneficiaries (6 Cal. Jur. 525, 526). There is no wording in the codicil appended to the Gracey will expressly directing the executor to convert said real estate into money, and we fail to discover from the language used by the testator any intent on his part by necessary or reasonable implication from the language used to require such conversion. Indeed, the plain intention is to the contrary, for if such conversion were intended and should be effectuated the entire California estate would be transmitted to the executor in the Pennsylvania administration and the benefactions under the codicil would be entirely defeated. We cannot ascribe such an intention to the testator. He must be held to have known that Mrs. Thursby had died before he executed the codicil and that the title to the real estate in California, or at least so much thereof as was not necessary to pay the funeral expenses and the bequests under the will of Mrs. Thursby, had vested in him and that the only way in which the beneficiaries under the codicil could receive their bounties would be by the probate of his will, including said codicil, in California, without an equitable conversion thereof into personalty. Otherwise his benefactions under the codicil would fail. Nor do we agree, as contended by appellants, that there was such a blending of personal and real estate by the testator as to show that he intended to create a fund and to make a testamentary disposition thereof in money. We conclude that the trial court did not err in refusing to apply the doctrine of equitable conversion to either the Thursby will or to the codicil of the Gracey will.

[8] It is next insisted by the appellants that if there was no equitable conversion under either will and if it be held, as we do hold, that the property in California was and is real estate for purposes of distribution, then Robert Feb. 1927.] ESTATE OF GRACEY. 491

Gracey died intestate as to such real estate. The contention is predicated upon the fact that in the codicil the word "devise" is not used and that the testator used the words, "I bequeath" one-half "of all the net amount that may come to me from said estate" to the "Public Library of the City of Merced," etc. It is argued that the use of the word "bequeath" was ineffectual to pass the title of said property as real estate. The contention appears to be that in order to effectuate the passing of title to real estate the word "devise" or other appropriate term applicable to real estate must be used. Section 1327 of the Civil Code provides: "Technical words in a will are to be taken in their technical sense, unless the context clearly indicates a contrary intention, or unless it satisfactorily appears that the will was drawn solely by the testator, and that he was unacquainted with such technical sense." In the application of the foregoing section of the Civil Code this court had under consideration, in Estate of Henderson, 161 Cal. 353 [119 Pac. 496], a question very similar to the one now presented with reference to the effect of the use of the terms "bequest," "legacies," "legatees," and "residuary legatees" in a holographic will as bearing upon the disposition of real property of the estate and where it appeared that the terms "devise" and "devisees" were not used. In that case it was said: "The primary purpose of all interpretation of wills is, of course, to ascertain the testator's intent, as disclosed by the language he has used. (Civ. Code, sec. 1317.) Of this class of questions it may be said, with more truth, perhaps, than of any other, that each case depends upon its own peculiar facts, and that precedents have comparatively small value. 'Except for the establishment of general principles, very little aid can be procured from adjudged cases in the construction of wills. It seldom happens that two cases can be found precisely alike, [citing cases] . . . The appellant argues, further, that, inasmuch as the estate (and the residue) included both real and personal property, such real property as was contained in the residue could not be covered by a gift over of 'legacies' given to 'legatees.' [9] But, while technical words in a will are ordinarily to be taken in their technical sense, they will not be so taken when it appears that they were used in another 492 ESTATE OF GRACEY. [200 Cal.
sense by a testator who drew his will without an acquaintance with the technical sense. (Civ. Code, sec. 1327; *Estate of Peabody*, 154 Cal. 172 [97 Pac. 184].) The will before us was, as we have said, holographic, and it is perfectly clear from its provisions that the testator was unfamiliar with the distinctions between terms appropriate to testamentary gifts of personal and those of real estate. Although the estate comprises realty, the will does not contain the words 'devise' or 'devisee.' The testator makes gifts of his interest in real estate, and then speaks of the residue, after paying all the 'bequests herein provided for.' He makes provision for 'residuary legatees,' but says nothing of 'residuary devisees.' It is plain, therefore, that the testator used the terms 'bequests,' 'legacy,' 'legatees' and 'residuary legatees' loosely, and without regard to their exact technical meaning. In order to give full effect to these expressions they must be read as referring to gifts to takers of realty, as well as of personal property." (*Estate of Henderson, supra*, pp. 357, 358; *Estate of Budd*, 166 Cal. 286 [135 Pac. 1131].)

[10] So in the case at bar it appears that the codicil was holographic in form. As the appeal is on the judgment-roll alone the evidence is not before us. All intendments are in favor of the determinations of the trial court and in the absence of a contrary showing on this appeal it must be assumed that it appeared that the codicil was drawn solely by the testator and that he was unacquainted with the technical meaning of the term "bequeath" and intended by its use that it should apply to the takers of real property as well as personal property. [11] A will should be so interpreted as to render it operative, if it be reasonably susceptible of such interpretation, to the end that the intention of the testator be given effect and that intestacy be avoided (Civ. Code, sec. 1317; *Estate of Phelps*, 182 Cal. 752 [190 Pac. 17]; *Estate of Wilson*, 184 Cal. 63 [193 Pac. 581]; *Estate of Franck*, 190 Cal. 28 [210 Pac. 417]; *Estate of McCurdy*, 197 Cal. 276 [240 Pac. 498]; 26 Cal. Jur. 899). On the record before us it must therefore be concluded that the word "bequeath" was used by the testator not in its technical sense but as applying to both real and personal property. Such interpretation is reasonable and intestacy is thereby avoided. Feb. 1927.]                                                                 Esate of Gracey.                                                                 493

[12] In determining the amount of the Gracey estate which it was competent for the testator to leave to the respondents for charitable and benevolent uses under section 1313 of the Civil Code the trial court fixed the net value of the estate in California and elsewhere and apportioned one-third of the total to the beneficiaries under the codicil. In this respect the appellants concede that the court followed the rule laid down in Estate of Dwyer, 159 Cal. 687. [115 Pac. 242], where it was held that in fixing the amount of the one-third of the estate which might be distributed to charitable uses under said section 1313 the aggregate estate wherever situated is to be taken into consideration. But it is insisted that the court erred in so fixing the aggregate of such estate for the reason that it appears that the administration of the estate of Gracey in Pennsylvania had not been closed and that additional costs of administration in that state may accrue. Here again the evidence is not before us, and in the absence of a showing to the contrary it must be assumed that sufficient competent evidence was before the trial court upon which to base its implied finding to the effect that the administration of the Pennsylvania estate had progressed to a point where no further costs would accrue. The burden was upon the appellants to show the insufficiency of the evidence to support the finding of the aggregate amount of said estate or to show some abuse of discretion on the part of the trial court and such showing has not been made.

We have examined the cases relied upon by the appellants and we find therein nothing inconsistent with the conclusions herein expressed as applied to the particular facts in this case.

The decree is affirmed.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Superior Court of Madera County. Stanley Murray, Judge. Affirmed.

The facts are stated in the opinion of the court.

Flint & MacKay, Robert B. Jackson, F. W. Henderson and Joseph Barcroft for Appellant.

Sherwood Green and John W. Maloy for Respondents.

WASTE, C. J.—A petition to have this cause heard in the supreme court after judgment in the district court of appeal, third appellate district, was granted in order that further argument might be had on the question therein involved. After further consideration of the case, we are of the view that the decision of the district court of appeal was correct. The following portion of the opinion by Mr. Justice Plummer is therefore adopted as the opinion of this court:

"The facts necessary to be stated are in brief as follows: The defendant Charles F. Silva, the owner of a band of cattle, made, executed and delivered to the plaintiff a chattel mortgage thereon. Thereafter, and on the first day of September, 1923, the defendant Silva placed said cattle in the possession of the defendants Donnelly and Clark, for pasturage purposes upon pasture lands belonging to said defendants. Said cattle were pastured by Donnelly and Clark until the first day of December, 1923, and they claim an agistor's lien for the value of the pasturage in the sum of $1890. The amount of this claim is not disputed. The only question involved is whether an agistor's lien takes precedence of a prior chattel mortgage.

[1] "Section 2897 of the Civil Code, in relation to priority of liens, reads as follows: 'Other things being equal, different liens upon the same property have priority according to the time of their creation, except in cases of bottomry and respondentia.' In order to determine whether a lien takes precedence under this section, it is necessary to determine whether other things are equal. Where the lien is created by contract, there is no difficulty whatever in determining the question of priority; it is only when a lien 496 FIRST NAT. BANK v. SILVA. [200 Cal.
is created by contract and a subsequent lien is created by reason of an existing statute. [2] In the latter case, the wording of the statutes or codes determines the question of priority, as the contract lien is presumed to have been created with knowledge of the law. If the statute exists providing for the creation of liens and determining their priority at the time of the creation of the contract lien, then no constitutional provisions are violated by giving precedence to a subsequently acquired statutory lien over a prior contract lien.

[3] "Some of the cases also distinguish between what are purely common-law liens and statute liens. In this case, however, whether formerly existing as common-law liens or otherwise, a large number of liens, including the lien of agisters, are grouped together and provided for in the same section of the Civil Code. Section 3051 of the Civil Code places agister's liens in the category which we have mentioned. We here quote: 'Every person who, while lawfully in possession of an article of personal property renders any service to the owner thereof, by labor or skill, employed for the protection, improvement, safekeeping, or carriage thereof, has a special lien thereon, dependent on possession, for the compensation, if any, which is due to him from the owner for such service; a person who makes, alters, or repairs any article of personal property, at the request of the owner, or legal possessor of the property, has a lien on the same for his reasonable charges for the balance due for such work done and materials furnished, and may retain possession of the same until the charges are paid; and livery or boarding or feed stable proprietors, and persons pasturing horses or stock, have a lien, dependent on possession, for their compensation in caring for, boarding, feeding, or pasturing such horses or stock; and laundry proprietors and persons conducting a laundry business, have a general lien, dependent on possession, upon all personal property in their hands belonging to a customer, for the balance due them from such customer for laundry work; and veterinary proprietors and veterinary surgeons shall have a lien, dependent on possession, for their compensation in caring for, boarding, feeding and medical treatment of animals; and keepers of garages for automobiles shall have a lien, dependent on possession, Feb. 1927.] FIRST NAT. BANK v. SILVA. 497

for their compensation in caring for and safekeeping such automobiles.' There seems to be no difference in the legal meaning of the language used in reference to the different liens there provided for, although there is some difference in the actual language used. In all but one instance, the lien given is 'dependent upon possession,' while, in one instance, the language reads, 'and may retain possession of the same until the charges are paid.' While the language differs, the meaning is the same, that is, the lien is dependent upon the possession of the article upon which the lien is claimed by the one asserting the lien, and may be maintained until the lien is discharged by payment.

[4] "Section 3052 of the Civil Code was amended in 1907, giving to every lienholder of a lien provided for in section 3051 [Stats. 1907, p. 86] of the Civil Code exactly the same rights and the same remedies. Prior to the amendment, section 3052 gave rights and remedies only to a person who had altered or repaired articles of personal property. Thus, a clear distinction was made by the legislature with regard to the remedies afforded lienholders. Since the amendment of section 3052, the right to sell the property upon which the lien is claimed is given to any one of the several classes of persons named in section 3051, with the same right and privilege to convert the personal property into cash, irrespective of the prior chattel mortgage, as might have been exercised by anyone claiming a lien for repairs or alterations prior to the amendment of the section. In the case of Wilson v. Donaldson, 121 Cal. 8 [66 Am. St. Rep. 17, 43 L. R. A. 524, 53 Pac. 404], the question involved was whether one who had harvested certain grain had a lien thereon for the charges and expenses of harvesting that would take precedence of a chattel mortgage. The court in that case, in holding that a harvester's lien did not take precedence, commented upon the character of lien which is involved in this case, and in its comments quoted from an Indiana case, there cited, the following language: 'As the agistor's lien depends alone upon the statute, it can have no greater force than the statute gives it, and as the legislature has, as we have said, manifested no intention of giving to it superiority over other liens, it can have none,' and then in relation to the lien involved in that case, further said: 'In the absence of the

200 Cal.—32 498 First Nat. Bank v. Silva. [200 Cal.

statute, the appellant would have no lien whatever. All his rights come from the statute, and therefore must be weighed and limited by the statute. If the legislature had desired to give such lien claimants a priority over contract liens, it was an easy thing to have said so.' This decision was rendered in May, 1898, since which date section 3052, Civil Code, relied upon in that case, has been amended, and the legislature has placed agistors' liens along with a number of other kinds of liens in the same class occupied by repairmen. This being true, if persons making repairs or alterations on articles of personal property, etc., have a preferential lien as against holders of chattel mortgages, and it has been so held by the courts of this state, then we can perceive no valid reason why other lienholders grouped with repairmen under section 3051, Civil Code, and given exactly the same rights and privileges by section 3052, Civil Code, should not also occupy the same preferential position, and chattel mortgages held to be executed with knowledge of the law and the possibility of statutory preferential liens in all of the cases specified in section 3051, Civil Code, as well as in one or two particular instances therein specified, especially when the language of the two sections of the code indicates that the legislature intended no such difference, and has, by the amendment of section 3052, Civil Code, explicitly placed all the lienholders there referred to upon an equality. In the case of Mortgage Securities Co. v. Pfaffmann, 177 Cal. 109 [L. R. A. 1918D, 118, 169 Pac. 1033], the Supreme Court of this state has held that, under sections 3051 and 3052 of the Civil Code, the statutory lien of one who makes repairs upon personal property is superior to the pre-existing lien of a chattel mortgage. In that case the court refers to the amendment to section 3052, Civil Code, giving the same rights and remedies to all the lienholders mentioned and provided for in section 3051, Civil Code. The case of Wilson v. Donaldson, supra, is also referred to and the fact pointed out that that decision was prior to the amendment, and also further states that the case of Wilson v. Donaldson cannot be treated as having been a thoroughly considered case. In neither the Wilson v. Donaldson case, nor in the case of Mortgage Securities Co. v. Pfaffmann, was the question of an agistor's lien involved. Feb. 1927.] FIRST NAT. BANK v. SILVA. 499

The former related to harvesting grain, and the latter referred to repairs made upon an automobile upon which a chattel mortgage had previously been given. Both cases, however, take up and discuss agistor's liens. The Wilson case refers to the case of Case v. Allen, 21 Kan. 217 [30 Am. Rep. 425], wherein an agistor's lien is held superior to a chattel mortgage, and commented adversely on this holding, while the court in the later case of Mortgage Securities Co. v. Pfaffmann refers to the Kansas decision as a well-considered case, and entirely approves the rule there laid down. After considering and mentioning the different kinds of liens, the court in the Mortgage Securities Co. case says: 'It remains to be added that the question of priority is wholly controlled by our statutory law. If by the fair intendment of that law these classes now enumerated in section 3051 of the Civil Code are given a preferential lien over the holder of an earlier chattel mortgage, we are not embarrassed in so declaring. We are well convinced that our law does with intention make the possessory lien of the improver and of the repairer superior to the lien of the pre-existing chattel mortgage. True, it is said in Wilson v. Donaldson that if the legislature had desired to give such lien claimants priority over chattel mortgage liens, it was an easy thing to have said so, but our conviction is that it has said so and that its declaration has the support of reason and justice. Did the legislature mean that every artisan and mechanic to whom might be delivered a chattel for improvement and repair must search the records to discover whether that article had been mortgaged and failing so to do, be at the peril of the impairment or total destruction of his lien, or did it mean that the money lender who took for security a chattel mortgage should take it with the understanding as part of his contract that improvements and repairs placed upon the article should be subject to a preferential possessory lien? Without hesitation we answer that the second alternative is sustainable as a just interpretation of the legislative enactments. Under the language of the two sections it seems most manifest that such is the true construction. Instancing but one consideration alone and that the right and power of the possessory lien claimant to sell the property, that right absolute is given him and he may exercise 500 FIRST NAT. BANK v. SILVA. [200 Cal.

it so far as the statute reads without regard to the existence of the chattel mortgage and without regard to whether or not the chattel mortgage is foreclosable. One would certainly look to see some limiting language in the law if these provisions as to the right of sale and disposition of the proceeds of the sale were to be subordinate to a preferential right on the part of the holder of a chattel mortgage, and it certainly makes more for the protection of society and for the conduct of its business to say that all of these classes of men who preserve, improve, or repair personal property should, like mechanics and artisans under the mechanic's lien law, have their liens declared preferential. Concerning the money lender who holds the chattel mortgage, two suggestions may be briefly advanced—one, that the possessory lien claimant has preserved, improved, or repaired the property upon which he has a lien, and, consequently, has added a value to the security commensurate with his just charge; the other, that the money lender desiring to take the security of a chattel mortgage can with much more readiness reduce the amount of his loan to protect himself against the possible liability of a possessory lien than can the work-a-day artisan take the time to inspect the records to see whether such chattel mortgage exists against the property.'

"If by section 3052, Civil Code, the legislature, in giving the right to a repairman to sell the property on which he has made repairs without reference to the chattel mortgage, indicated its intention to say that such lien shall take precedence, we do not well see how it can be argued that other lienholders provided for in section 3051, Civil Code, and given exactly the same rights and remedies by section 3052, Civil Code, are not likewise placed in the preferential class. If it is correct that the legislature intended to say that a repairman shall have a preferential lien as against chattel mortgages, then it certainly has said the same thing as to all other lienholders grouped with the repairman and given the same standing as to rights and remedies.

"The case of Guinn v. McReynolds, 177 Cal. 230 [170 Pac. 421], where a preferential lien was denied to the county of Tulare, under section 2322a of the Political Code as it then stood in giving liens for the extermination of squirrels and other pests, did not involve a construction of section 3052, Feb. 1927.] FIRST NAT. BANK v. SILVA. 501

Civil Code, and at the time of the [transactions involved in that case] there was nothing in the codes or statutes indicating that the county should have a preferential lien. It may be added that section 2322a of the Political Code has been amended and gives such lien. In Case v. Allen, 21 Kan. 217 [30 Am. Rep. 425], the Supreme Court of that state expressly held that an agistor's lien created by statute is paramount to a lien of a prior chattel mortgage upon the same cattle, and sets forth therein fully the reasons for so holding. This case, as we have shown, was approved by the Supreme Court of this state in the Mortgage Securities Company case, which practically overruled the Wilson case. It may also be mentioned that the Wilson case was a department decision, while the Mortgage Securities Company case was a decision en banc. The Mortgage Securities Company case was before the Appellate Court (47 Cal. App. 383 [190 Pac. 641]), after retrial, and the judgment therein upholds the priority of the lien of the repairman. Krantzhor v. Al. G. Faulkner Co., 43 Cal. App. 441 [185 Pac. 305], also upholds the priority of a repairman's lien over a chattel mortgage. Other cases holding that an agistor's liens take precedence may be cited as follows: Colquitt & Baggs v. Kirkman, 47 Ga. 555; Smith v. Stevens, 36 Minn. 303 [31 N. W. 55]. In line with the decision in Mortgage Securities Company case is that of Jesse A. Smith Auto Co. v. Kaestner, 164 Wis. 205 [159 N. W. 738]."

While it may be contended by appellant, the weight of authority in other jurisdictions is against giving precedence to any of the lienholders mentioned in section 3051 of the Civil Code, we are of the opinion that it is now the established rule in this state they are given preferential liens over holders of earlier chattel mortgages. It is eminently just that the rule should be applied to this case. As was said in Case v. Allen, supra, at *p. 220: "the lien of the agistor is not the mere creature of contract. It is created by statute from the fact of the keeping of the cattle. The possession of the agistor was rightful; and, the possession being rightful, the keeping gave rise to the lien; and such keeping was as much for the interest of the mortgagee as the mortgagor. The cattle were kept alive thereby; and the principle seems to be that where the mortgagee does not take the possession, 502 First Nat. Bank v. Silva. [200 Cal.

but leaves it with the mortgage, he thereby assents to the creation of a statutory lien for any expenditure reasonably necessary for the preservation or ordinary repair of the thing mortgaged. Such indebtedness really inures to his benefit. The entire value of his mortgage may rest upon the creation of such indebtedness and lien, as in the case at bar, where the thing mortgaged is live-stock, and the lien for food."

The conclusion we have reached makes it unnecessary to consider the further contention of the respondents that the appellant gave express or implied consent that the bill for pasturage should constitute a lien superior to that of the chattel mortgage.

The judgment is affirmed.

Curtis, J., Langdon, J., Preston, J., Seawell, J., and Richards, J., concurred.

SHENK, J., Concurring and Dissenting.—I concur in the judgment on the ground that the record discloses that appellant assented to the creation of a statutory lien preferment as against itself. The facts were stipulated. On the first day of September, 1923, the respondents Donnelly and Clark became the lessees of 13,760 acres of land in Madera County formerly held under lease by the respondent Silva. While in possession of the premises Silva had mortgaged some 700 head of cattle to the plaintiff's assignor with the usual provision in the mortgage that on the default of the mortgagor the mortgagee would have the right to take possession of the mortgaged property without notice. On September 1, 1923, Silva was in default and the cattle were on said premises. On that day Donnelly and Clark notified the appellant that they were informed that the appellant had an interest in said livestock and that from September 1, 1923, a charge of one dollar per head per month would be made against the appellant for pasturage. Under date of September 5th the appellant's representative notified Donnelly and Clark that the cattle would be removed in ten days. They were not removed and when on November 22, 1923, their possession was demanded by the appellant such possession was refused on account of nonpayment of pasturage charges. Under these circumstances the implied consent of the appellant that pasturage charges would accrue Feb. 1927.] FIRST NAT. BANK v. SILVA. 503

and the lien thereof attach would seem to have been satisfactorily shown.

But I cannot agree that under our law an agistor's lien has priority over a pre-existing recorded chattel mortgage. It is conceded that an agistor's lien did not exist at common law and the well-established rule is not questioned that under a statute which creates a lien which did not exist at common law such lien has no priority unless plainly authorized by the statute which creates it. Sections 3051 and 3052 of the Civil Code do not expressly create a preference as to the liens provided for in section 3051, and, in my opinion, such preference is not fairly implied from the language used. As to those which were liens at common law no difficulty is encountered, for under established rules they may be accorded priority. Such a lien was involved in *Mortgage Securities Co. v. Pfaffmann*, 177 Cal. 109 [L. R. A. 1918D, 118, 169 Pac. 1033], where it was declared that under the sections of the code referred to the possessory lien of the repairer of personal property was superior to the lien of a pre-existing chattel mortgage. One who made, altered, or repaired an article of personal property had a lien at common law and the Pfaffmann case was necessarily limited in its effect to a repairman's lien. Nothing else was there involved or decided. That case recognized that the agistor had no lien at common law. In commenting upon such a lien it was there definitely stated that "under statutes creating agistor's liens where questions of priority arose, all the reasoning which . . . goes to support the priority of the repairer's lien was wholly absent." This for the reason that the agistment does not fall within the principle of improving personal property. The main opinion recognizes that the weight of authority in other jurisdictions is against the preferment of the agistor's lien. The rule is stated in 11 Corpus Juris, at page 652, with a citation of some forty-two cases from twenty-one states and the respondents have cited no authority to the contrary except *Case v. Allen*, 21 Kan. 217 [30 Am. Rep. 425], which, in *Wilson v. Donaldson*, 121 Cal. 8 [66 Am. St. Rep. 17, 43 L. R. A. 524, 53 Pac. 404], was stated to be a well-considered case upholding the priority of an agistor's lien provided by statute. But the supreme court of Kansas in *Bank v. Brecheisen*, 65 Kan. 807 504 First Nat. Bank v. Silva. [200 Cal.

[70 Pac. 795], was at pains to limit the effect of Case v. Allen, and the supreme court of Utah (Grubb v. Lashus, 42 Utah, 254 [129 Pac. 1029]) correctly says that courts are practically unanimous in disapproving the views expressed in Case v. Allen. So it may properly be said that the overwhelming weight of authority elsewhere is that an agistor's lien has no priority over a pre-existing chattel mortgage unless given such by statute. The main opinion declares that it is now the established rule in this state that the lienholders mentioned in section 3051 of the Civil Code have preferential liens over prior chattel mortgages. In my opinion this may not rightly be said. Rather should it be said that only such liens provided for in said section as were liens at common law should have such preference. As has been pointed out, such a common-law lien confirmed by statute was involved in the Pfaffman case and the reasons for its priority were there declared to be wholly lacking in the case of an agistment. Fifteen days after the decision in the Pfaffmann case this court decided in Guinn v. McReynolds, 177 Cal. 230 [170 Pac. 421], that prior to 1917 section 2322a of the Political Code, which gave a lien and substantially the same right of foreclosure thereof as section 3052 of the Civil Code, did not prefer the lien therein created to a pre-existing chattel mortgage. Section 2322a was later amended to grant such preference. In Guinn v. McReynolds reference is made to many instances in which the statutes of this state have declared particular liens created to be prior and always with plain language to that effect. In neither section 3051 nor section 3052 is the priority of an agistor's lien declared and there is no case in this state and no well-considered case elsewhere granting such preferment in the absence of statutory authority.

[S. F. No. 12160. In Bank.—February 23, 1927.]

ANTHONY A. DWYER, Petitioner, v. CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF BERKELEY et al., Respondents.

[1] MUNICIPAL CORPORATIONS—ZONING ORDINANCE—BERKELEY CHARTER—INITIATIVE AND REFERENDUM—CONSTRUCTION.—An ordinance amending a zoning ordinance of the City of Berkeley is within the initiative and referendum provisions of the charter of that city.

[2] Id.—CONSTITUTIONALITY OF CHARTER.—Initiative and referendum provisions of a freeholder's charter adopted by a city in pursuance of the provisions of article XI, section 8, of the state constitution, are valid and constitutional.

[3] Id.—EXERCISE OF LEGISLATIVE PREROGATIVE—ORDINANCES.—Only ordinances of a municipality which involve an exercise of a legislative prerogative are subject to the initiative and referendum.

[4] Id.—ZONING ORDINANCES—POLICE POWER.—Zoning ordinances are police power enactments designed for the promotion and perpetuation of the moral and material welfare of the people.

[5] Id.—POLICE REGULATION—CONSTITUTIONAL LAW.—The power to enact police regulations is conferred upon cities by section 11 of article XI of the constitution; and municipalities are expressly authorized to establish districts or zones within which the use of property may be regulated by an act of the legislature passed in 1917 (Stats. 1917, p. 1419).

[6] Id.—BERKELEY CHARTER—INITIATIVE AND REFERENDUM—CONSTRUCTION.—Not only have the citizens of Berkeley in their charter failed to expressly exclude zoning ordinances from the operation of the initiative and referendum, but they have phrased the sections pertaining to these powers in such broad, general, and unambiguous language, as to impel the conclusion that it was intended that legislation on every municipal subject should, unless expressly or by clear and necessary implication excluded, be subject to a reference to the people for approval or rejection.

[7] Id.—ZONING ORDINANCE—REFERENDUM—EXCLUSION BY IMPLICATION.—A zoning ordinance passed as an amendment to the general and comprehensive zoning law of the City of Berkeley is not excluded from the referendum provision of the charter of that city by necessary implication.

3. See 18 Cal. Jur. 946.

4. Validity of zoning ordinances, notes, 43 A. L. R. 668; 38 A. L. R. 1496; 33 A. L. R. 287; 19 A. L. R. 1395.

5. See 18 Cal. Jur. 858. 506 DWYER v. CITY COUNCIL. [200 Cal.

[8] Id.—LOCAL ORDINANCE—GENERAL VOTE ON.—If it be conceded that a zoning ordinance is local in character and directly affects only a small proportion of the population of the city, there is nothing theoretically inconsistent in permitting the electorate of the entire city to pass upon it by a referendum election or to enact it by initiative proceedings.

[9] Id.—NATURE OF INITIATIVE AND REFERENDUM LAWS.—By the enactment of initiative and referendum laws the people simply withdraw from the legislative body and reserve to themselves the right to exercise a part of their inherent legislative power.

[10] Id.—APPLICATION OF REFERENDUM PROVISIONS.—Since the legislative body of a city exercises powers derived from the people, and the city council, the legislative body of the city, representing the electorate of the entire city, has authority to pass a zoning ordinance, no violence is done to principles of statutory construction in holding that the local character of the ordinance, if it be such, is not of itself sufficient to preclude an application of the referendum.

[11] Id.—GENERAL ZONING SCHEME—INTEREST OF ENTIRE MUNICIPALITY.—In view of the substantial interest which the electors of an entire municipality have in its zoning scheme, it cannot be held that because residents of a particular locality rezoned may be more immediately and apparently affected than are residents of other portions of the city, the broad initiative and referendum provisions of a city charter and the constitution do not apply to an amendment to the general zoning law which reclassifies a portion of the city's territory.

[12] Id.—AMENDMENT TO ZONING LAW—RIGHT OF PROTEST—APPLICATION OF INITIATIVE AND REFERENDUM.—Although an application of the initiative and referendum provisions of the charter of Berkeley to an ordinance amending the general zoning ordinance of that city may deprive the residents of a reclassified district and of the area of protest of rights accorded them by the zoning law, when an amendment to the zoning law is passed by the city council, the proponents and opponents are given all the privileges and rights to express themselves in an open election that a democracy or republican form of government can afford to its citizens, and the constitutional right reserved by the people to submit legislative questions to a direct vote cannot be abridged by a procedural requirement of a superseded municipal ordinance dealing with the same subject of legislation.

[13] Id.—RECLASSIFICATION—PASSAGE OF ORDINANCE—PROCEDURE.—An ordinance of the City of Berkeley providing that under ordinary conditions a majority vote of the council is sufficient to effect a reclassification under the zoning ordinance, but which further provides that in the event of protest filed representing twenty per cent or more of the area of the property included in the Feb. 1927.] DWYER v. CITY COUNCIL. 507

proposed reclassification, or twenty per cent or more of the frontage of property other than that proposed to be reclassified but within the area of protest, a reclassification may only be effected by a two-thirds vote of the council, affects only legislation by ordinance and has no influence upon direct legislation.

APPLICATION for a Writ of Mandate to compel the City Council of Berkeley to repeal or submit to referendum an ordinance amending the zoning ordinance of that city by reclassifying property. Writ granted.

The facts are stated in the opinion of the court.

J. E. Pemberton and Albert M. Hardie for Petitioner.

Earl J. Sinclair, City Attorney, and Calkins, Hagar, Hall & Linforth for Respondents.

SEAWELL, J.—Petition for writ of mandate to compel the City Council of the City of Berkeley to either repeal or submit to a referendum vote of the people an ordinance passed by said City Council reclassifying as a business and public use district of class IV certain property designated in the comprehensive zoning ordinance of said city as a residence district of class I, wherein only dwellings, flats, clubs, churches, railroad shelter stations, apartment houses without stores, and hotels without stores are permitted. It appears from a stipulation as to facts entered into by the parties, and from the petition for the writ and return to the alternative writ, that petitioner is a resident, taxpayer, and elector of the City of Berkeley who owns and resides upon property in the vicinity of the property described in the ordinance of reclassification, and who is also one of the signers of the petition by which the referendum is sought to be invoked. The City Council of Berkeley, the mayor, the respective members of said Council, and the city clerk are named as 508 DWYER v. CITY COUNCIL. [200 Cal.

respondents. The area reclassified comprises approximately a one five hundred and fiftieth (1/550) part of the city and is owned by the University of California, which, it is alleged, desires and intends to conduct a poultry farm and experiment station on said land, which project contemplates the raising of chickens on a large scale in connection with its courses in poultry husbandry. The intention of raising chickens on a large scale on said lands is denied, but it is admitted that it is the purpose of said university to use a portion of said land as "an experiment station in connection with instruction in poultry husbandry." It is alleged in the return to the alternative writ that the property is bounded on the west by a district classified in the general zoning law as an industrial district of class VI, in which factories not obnoxious, warehouses, including any business use, stables, feed and fuel yards, aviation fields and residences of any kind included in class I are permitted; on the north by a district of class IV, in which schools, public and semi-public buildings, playgrounds, green-houses, nurseries, and residences of any kind included in class I may locate, and on the east and south by a district classified as a residence district of class I.

The general comprehensive zoning ordinance of the City of Berkeley was adopted by the City Council on June 1, 1920, and is designated Ordinance No. 666, N. S. Ordinance No. 1190, N. S., which is under consideration in the instant case, was passed by said City Council on May 25, 1926, as an amendment to the general zoning ordinance, after proceedings for amendment had been duly and regularly taken in accordance with the provisions of Ordinance No. 1130, N. S., which is also an amendment to Ordinance No. 666, N. S., and provides the procedure to be followed in reclassifying property pursuant to Ordinance No. 666, N. S. Within thirty days after the passage of said Ordinance No. 1190, N. S., Albert M. Hardie, one of the attorneys for petitioner, pursuant to the referendum provisions of the Berkeley charter, appeared at the office of the city clerk for the purpose of filing a referendum petition and requested said city clerk to compare, examine, and verify the signatures and certify to the sufficiency of the petition. The city clerk refused to accept, receive, or file the same. There- Feb. 1927.] DWYER v. CITY COUNCIL. 509

after said Hardie appeared before the Council in regular session assembled as the representative of petitioner and others. A resolution was passed at said meeting wherein it was recited that the Council refused to accept the petition for the reason that it had been advised by its legal adviser, the city attorney, that said Ordinance No. 1190, N. S., was not a proper subject for referendum. The point that the petition was not duly presented will be considered hereafter.

[1] It is the contention of respondents that an ordinance such as No. 1190, N. S., which amended the general zoning law, is neither within the initiative and referendum provisions of the state constitution, nor the statutes of the state, nor the provisions of the charter of the City of Berkeley.

The City of Berkeley operates under a freeholder's charter which went into effect July 1, 1909 (Stats. 1909, p. 1208), and was adopted in pursuance of the provisions of article XI, section 8, of the state constitution. The provisions of said charter relating to the initiative and referendum are articles XIII and XIV. Section 92 (art. XIII) pertaining to the initiative power is as follows:

"Direct legislation.

"Sec. 92. (1) Any proposed ordinance may be submitted to the Council by a petition signed by registered electors of the City equal in number to the percentage hereinafter required." (Italics supplied.)

The subsequent sections provide that if the petition accompanying the proposed ordinance is signed by electors equal in number to fifteen per centum of the entire vote cast for all candidates for mayor at the last preceding general municipal election at which a mayor was elected, the Council shall pass the ordinance without alteration within twenty days after the attachment of the clerk's certificate of sufficiency to the petition, or call a special initiative election within twenty-five days. If electors equal in number to at least five per centum, but less than fifteen per centum, have signed the petition the ordinance is to be passed by the Council or submitted to a vote of the people at the next general election, rather than at a special election. The referendum provision (art. XIV, sec. 93), as amended in 1923 (Stats. 1923, p. 1548), is as follows: 510 DWYER v. CITY COUNCIL. [200 Cal.
"Mode of protesting against ordinances.

"Sec. 93. No ordinance passed by the Council shall go into effect before thirty days from the time of its final passage, except when otherwise required by the general laws of the State or by the provisions of this Charter respecting street improvements, and except the ordinance making the annual tax levy, and except an ordinance for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health or safety, which contains a statement of its urgency, and is passed by a seven-ninths vote of the Council. . . . If during said thirty days a petition signed by qualified electors of the City equal in number to at least ten per centum of the entire vote cast for all candidates for Mayor at the last preceding general municipal election at which a Mayor was elected, protesting against the passage of such ordinance, be presented to the Council, the same shall thereupon be suspended from going into operation and it shall be the duty of the Council to reconsider such ordinance, and if the same be not entirely repealed, the Council shall submit the ordinance, as is provided in Article XIII of this Charter, to the vote of the electors of the City, either at the next general municipal election or at a special election to be called for that purpose, and such ordinance shall not go into effect or become operative unless a majority of the qualified electors voting on the same shall vote in favor thereof. . . ." (Italics supplied.)

It is to be observed that these provisions were embodied in the city charter of Berkeley before the electors of the state had, by constitutional amendment (art. IV, sec. 1), reserved to themselves "the power to propose laws and amendments to the Constitution, and to adopt or reject the same, at the polls independent of the legislature," and also "the power, at their option, to so adopt or reject any act, or section or part of any act, passed by the legislature," and prior to the day they provided for the reservation of the initiative and referendum to the electors of each county, city and county, city and town of the state by the following provision:

"The initiative and referendum powers of the people are hereby further reserved to the electors of each county, city and county, city and town of the state, to be exercised under such procedure as may be provided by law. . . . Nothing Feb. 1927.] DWYER v. CITY COUNCIL. 511

contained in this section shall be construed as affecting or limiting the present or future powers of cities or cities and counties having charters adopted under the provisions of section eight of article XI of this Constitution. In the submission to the electors of any measure under this section, all officers shall be guided by the general laws of this state, except as is herein otherwise provided. This section is self-executing, but legislation may be enacted to facilitate its operation, but in no way limiting or restricting either the provisions of this section or the powers herein reserved." (Art. IV, sec. 1, amendment adopted October 10, 1911.)

Pursuant to said amendment the legislature enacted measures providing for direct legislation in cities other than those having a freeholder's charter containing provisions for direct legislation. (Stats. Ex. Sess. 1911, p. 131; amended Stats. 1915, p. 319; amended Stats. 1917, p. 655.) These measures prescribe a procedure similar to that outlined by the City of Berkeley charter.

[2] The constitutionality and validity of charter provisions resembling those contained in the Berkeley charter were upheld in the case of *In re Pfahler*, 150 Cal. 71 [11 Ann. Cas. 911, 11 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1092, 88 Pac. 270], in which amendments to the Los Angeles city charter providing for the initiative and referendum were under review. In earlier cases passing upon the application of the initiative and referendum to other types of municipal legislation it has been said that if the right of referendum can be invoked, the corollary right to initiate legislation must be conceded to exist. (*Chase v. Kalber*, 28 Cal. App. 561 [153 Pac. 397]; *Starbuck v. City of Fullerton*, 34 Cal. App. 683 [168 Pac. 583].)

[3] It is plain that only ordinances of a municipality which involve an exercise of the legislative prerogative are subject to the initiative and referendum. (*Hopping v. Council of the City of Richmond*, 170 Cal. 605 [150 Pac. 977].) [4] Zoning ordinances are police power enactments designed for the promotion and perpetuation of the moral and material welfare of the people. (*Miller v. Board of Public Works*, 195 Cal. 477 [38 A. L. R. 1479, 234 Pac. 381], and cases therein cited.) [5] The power to enact police regulations is conferred upon cities by section 11 of 512 DWYER v. CITY COUNCIL. [200 Cal.
article XI of the constitution, and municipalities are expressly authorized to establish districts or zones within which the use of property may be regulated by an act of the legislature passed in 1917. (Stats. 1917, p. 1419.)

[6] Not only have the citizens of Berkeley in their charter failed to expressly exclude from the operation of the initiative and referendum ordinances of the kind in question, but they have phrased the sections pertaining to these powers in such broad, general, and unambiguous language as to impel the conclusion that it was intended that legislation on every municipal subject should, unless expressly or by clear and necessary implication excluded, be subject to a reference to the people for approval or rejection. In the charter provisions concerning the initiative the people reserved to themselves the right to enact *any* proposed ordinance by initiative proceedings (art. XIII, sec. 92), while the corresponding sections authorizing the use of the referendum as a mode of protest against legislative action provide that *no* ordinance, with certain exceptions expressly excluded and not applying in the instant case, shall go into effect for thirty days after its passage, and that during such time referendum proceedings may be instituted. (Art. XIV, sec. 93.)

[7] Respondents contend that although a zoning ordinance passed as an amendment to a general and comprehensive zoning law is not expressly excluded from the referendum provisions of the charter, it is by necessary implication so excluded. They argue that such an ordinance is local in nature and directly affects only those within the district rezoned, and, perhaps, in addition, those within the "area of protest," as defined in the zoning ordinance, and, further, that to subject such an ordinance to the referendum would be to render nugatory certain provisions of the zoning law protecting those who own and control property within the district to be reclassified and within the area of protest. From these premises they draw the conclusion that it cannot be presumed that the people intended, in the absence of a clear declaration to that effect, that zoning ordinances of the kind in question should be subject to the referendum. With this argument we cannot agree. To do so would be to disregard the fundamental nature of the initiative and Feb. 1927.] DWYER v. CITY COUNCIL. 513

referendum powers and to ignore the theory underlying the enactment of zoning laws.

[8] If it be conceded that the ordinance in question is local in character and directly affects only a small proportion of the population, there is nothing theoretically inconsistent in permitting the electorate of the entire city to pass upon it by a referendum election or to enact it by initiative proceedings. It is a fundamental tenet of the American system of representative government that the legislative power of a municipality resides in the people thereof, and that the right to exercise it has been conferred by them upon their duly chosen representatives.

[9] By the enactment of initiative and referendum laws the people have simply withdrawn from the legislative body and reserved to themselves the right to exercise a part of their inherent legislative power.

[10] Since the legislative body exercises power derived from the people, and since the City Council, the legislative body of Berkeley, representing the electorate of the entire city, admittedly had authority to pass the ordinance in question, no violence is done to principles of statutory construction in holding that the local character of the ordinance, if it be of such character, is not of itself sufficient to preclude an application of the referendum. (Ex parte Ellsworth, 165 Cal. 677 [133 Pac. 272]; Crippen v. Farrier, 166 Cal. 69 [134 Pac. 1139].) There may be reasons or considerations of policy why the people might not wish to reserve for themselves powers of direct legislation in regard to certain ordinances affecting one portion of the city more directly than other portions, but that is not a consideration of sufficient moment to overthrow an important legislative prerogative. It is a characteristic of much legislation, especially in this age of intense specialization of occupations and interests, that it operates, to a greater or less degree, more directly upon one group or section of the population than upon another, and the distinction between zoning legislation and many other types of legislation lies not so much in the fact that a certain proportion of the population which will be less directly affected may be permitted by the operation of the initiative and referendum to establish the rule to be applied to those more vitally and immediately affected, but, rather, that this result becomes more apparent in the

200 Cal.—33 514 DWYER v. CITY COUNCIL. [200 Cal.

case of zoning legislation reclassifying a district, for the reason that the section of the population most directly affected may more easily be segregated, by virtue of ownership or control of land within a certain geographical area, than in the case of other types of legislation.

If the comprehensive zoning law districting all portions of the city were before us, it could not be successfully contended that the ordinance would not be subject to the referendum, for the reason that residents of the city might be more vitally concerned in and affected by the particular regulations relating to the district in which they owned property or resided than in the restrictions applying to other districts. The vice of respondents' argument consists in placing undue stress upon the sectional interest which residents of a particular district may be expected to have in restrictions more immediately affecting their district and in under-emphasizing the interest of the community as a whole in the existence of a comprehensive zoning plan. It must be presumed that the electorate will act in the interests of the entire city, and of the part to be affected by the proposed legislation. If the law operates more directly upon only a part of the citizens evil intent or design cannot be presumed. It is important to those who own property or reside within a certain district not only that the use to which property may be put in such district be controlled and regulated, but that zoning restrictions embracing the entire city and embodying a well-defined plan be adopted. This proposition is aptly stated in *Zahn v. Board of Public Works*, 195 Cal. 497, 513 [234 Pac. 388, 395], in which it is said:

"The power of the city to zone is not limited in our opinion to the protection of established districts. To so hold would be to defeat in a large measure the very purpose of zoning which is to control future development in the best interest of the city. Zoning in its best sense looks not only backward to protect districts already established but forward to aid in the development of new districts according to a comprehensive plan having as its basis *the welfare of the city as a whole*." (Italics supplied.)

The restrictions relating to any portion of the city are an integral part of an entire scheme and should be the expression of a definite policy. The people in each zone are interested not only in having a comprehensive zoning law, but in what Feb. 1927.] DWYER v. CITY COUNCIL. 515

that law shall be. A zoning ordinance as amended becomes in effect a different ordinance. Even if it be granted that a reclassification of an area as small as that involved in the instant case cannot be said to effect a new scheme, the same rule must necessarily be followed as would be applied if a larger area had been reclassified, and it may be observed that a piecemeal rezoning of small areas may result in a plan differing in vital particulars from that originally contemplated. [11] In view of the substantial interest which the electors of the entire municipality have in its zoning scheme, it cannot be held that because residents of the particular locality rezoned may be more immediately and apparently affected than are residents of other portions of the city, the broad initiative and referendum provisions of the charter and constitution do not apply to an amendment to the general zoning law which reclassifies a portion of the city's territory.

[12] It is next contended that an application of the initiative and referendum provisions to a zoning ordinance such as here involved will deprive the residents of the reclassified district and of the area of protest of rights accorded them by the zoning law. Proceedings for the reclassification of property described in the general zoning law may be commenced by written petition of a citizen, by the city planning commission, or by resolution of the City Council. Before final action may be taken by the Council, two hearings are held, the first before the city planning commission, and the final hearing before the Council. Notices of both hearings are posted within the district affected and the area of protest, and those within such districts may file written protests. The area of protest includes the property which is sought to be reclassified, and all frontages within two hundred feet of any part of the frontage of the property proposed to be reclassified, or within three hundred feet if the property sought to be reclassified consists of two or more blocks of land. At the hearing before the city planning commission, both petitioners and protestants must be given full opportunity to present their views and to be heard. At the hearing before the Council, the written report of the city planning commission, based on the hearing before it and upon its investigations, is read, and each side is allowed fifteen minutes to present arguments. The Council may then 516 DWYER v. CITY COUNCIL. [200 Cal.
proceed to vote upon the matter in the same manner and with the same effect as in the case of other ordinances except that a two-thirds vote is required in the event that a protest has been filed representing twenty per cent or more of the area of the property included in the proposed reclassification, or twenty per cent or more of the frontage of property other than that proposed to be reclassified, but within the area of protest. (Sec. 12, Ordinance 1130, N. S., City of Berkeley.)

Complaint is made that if the referendum be applied to the proposed amendatory zoning ordinance the persons most directly affected thereby shall have lost the opportunity to present their arguments for and against the proposed measure to the electorate in the manner provided by the ordinance. The answer to this contention is that all persons interested in the measure had to the moment of its adoption an opportunity to appear and oppose or advocate the passage of the proposed ordinance. So far as the adoption of the ordinance was concerned no right was denied them. By the petition for a referendum the matter has been removed from the forum of the Council to the forum of the electorate. The proponents and opponents are given all the privileges and rights to express themselves in an open election that a democracy or republican form of government can afford to its citizens upon any municipal or public affair. The ordinance procedure served its purpose and if there had been no referendum the adoption of the ordinance would have been complete. It is clear that the constitutional right reserved by the people to submit legislative questions to a direct vote cannot be abridged by any procedural requirement of a superseded municipal ordinance dealing with the same subject of legislation.

[13] No weight can be given to respondents' cause by reason of the provisions of section 12, Ordinance No. 1130, N. S., which provide that under ordinary conditions a majority vote of the Council is sufficient to effect a reclassification, but which further provide that in the event of protest filed representing twenty per cent or more of the area of the property included in the proposed reclassification, or twenty per cent or more of the frontage of property other than that proposed to be reclassified but within the area of protest, a reclassification may only be effected by a two-thirds Feb. 1927.] DWYER v. CITY COUNCIL. 517

vote of the Council. Said provisions affect only legislation by ordinance and have not the slightest bearing or influence upon direct legislation.

Doubtless amendments to the zoning ordinance will continue to be made by action of the Council without the intervention of the initiative or referendum, and we do not hold here that the ordinance may not be amended in the manner proposed by the City Council. The policy of giving to the public generally the right to invoke the initiative and referendum in matters of zoning when the effect may be more acutely felt in a given district than by the community at large may be questioned as the wisest exercise of power in such cases. But this is a question of political policy to be determined by the people. We see no dangers sufficiently imminent to warrant this court in holding that it was the intention of the framers of the law to exclude the ordinance in question from the operation of the initiative and referendum.

We have been cited by respondents to three cases upon which they chiefly rely as authorities sustaining their contention. We refer to them in the order in which they were filed: *Hopping* v. *Council of the City of Richmond*, 170 Cal. 605 [150 Pac. 977]; *Chase* v. *Kalber*, 28 Cal. App. 561 [153 Pac. 397]; *Starbuck* v. *City of Fullerton*, 34 Cal. App. 683 [168 Pac. 583]. The opinion in the first case above cited was written by former Justice Shaw. The question before the court in that case was whether a certain resolution adopted by the council of the city of Richmond accepting a proposition of the Harbor Center Land Company offering to donate the sum of four thousand dollars toward the cost of erection of a new city hall on a block of land given by said company to the city of Richmond, on condition that the city appropriate at least an equal amount for the construction of said city hall on said lot, and that when completed it should be occupied and used by the city as such hall, provided the deed was approved by the city attorney, was subject to referendum proceedings. The council held that it was not. The question was tested by the issuance of a writ of mandate. The court held that the resolution was a proper question to be submitted to the voters of the city. In his observations on the power of the referendum, Mr. 518 DWYER v. CITY COUNCIL. [200 Cal.
Justice Shaw in very guarded language, which is admittedly *dicta*, said:

"There may be grounds for excluding from the operation of these powers legislative acts which are special and local in their nature and in which the entire body of citizens who shall exercise the power of referendum and initiative is not interested, such as resolutions to make local improvements and the like. This question is not before us, for the matters determined by the resolution are not local to any particular part of Richmond but apply generally to, and interest all in the entire city. . . . Inasmuch as the question will doubtless be brought before us in the future, we desire to state here that we express no opinion on the subject and that what we have said must not be understood as having any bearing thereon."

There is nothing of an authoritative character in the case which aids respondents in the instant case.

The other two cases cited are street improvement cases, which were local in character and did not arise in cities governed by freeholders' charters. Street improvement laws must from the nature of the results to be attained operate upon districts or fractional parts of cities, and it was not within the contemplation or intention of the framers of the law that they should be treated as general, comprehensive schemes. In none of the street improvement cases cited was the question of an amendment affecting an ordinance that operated upon all portions of the municipality and had been adopted in its entirety touched upon. In the instant case the zoning law from the first was treated by the Council as a general, comprehensive plan, molded, fashioned, and balanced with reference to the city as a whole. In *Chase v. Kalber*, *supra*, Mr. Justice Hart, in a very learned and analytical discussion, points out the impracticable results that would follow if the street improvement acts were made subject to the operation of the initiative and referendum provisions of the law, and the serious hampering of the orderly administration of the public business that would follow. He arrives at the conclusion that, by reason of the chaos and disorder that would follow, it could not have been the intention of the people to apply the referendum and initiative to a law that was essentially local in character. No such argument can be applied to the situation confront- Feb. 1927.] DWYER v. CITY COUNCIL. 519

ing us. If the question was a doubtful one we would be required by the rules of statutory construction to resolve the doubt in favor of giving effect to the constitutional prerogative. It is interesting to here note that the charter provisions of the City of Berkeley (art. XIV, sec. 93) impliedly exempt street improvement ordinances from the operation of the referendum.

There is no merit in the claim that the petition by which the referendum was sought to be invoked was not presented to the clerk and Council in the time and manner provided by law. We have examined the stipulation of counsel, which sets forth all that was done by the representative of the petitioners in presenting the referendum petition, and are fully satisfied that respondents have no legal grounds upon which to base the claim that the petition was not properly and legally presented and offered for filing.

A peremptory writ of mandate will issue directing the city clerk of the City of Berkeley to indorse the date upon which the petition was presented to her, and to examine the same to ascertain whether it conforms with the requirements of the charter of the City of Berkeley, and, if found to conform to the provisions of said charter in such cases made and provided and particularly to the provisions of article XIV, section 93 and section 94, and the provisions of article III which affect the question, to file the same; and, further, directing the mayor and Council of said city, if said petition shall be found to be legal and sufficient in all respects, to either repeal said Ordinance No. 1190, N. S., or submit the same to the vote of the electors of the City of Berkeley, as in section 93, article XIV, provided, and to perform all other acts that may be meet and proper in the premises.

It is so ordered.

HUGH FAY, Petitioner, v. THE DISTRICT COURT OF APPEAL, SECOND APPELLATE DISTRICT, DIVISION TWO, et al., Respondents.

[1] COURTS—JUDICIAL COUNCIL AMENDMENT—CONSTRUCTION.—It sufficiently appears from the body of the "Judicial Council Amendment" to the constitution (article VI, sections 1a, 6, 7, and 8), when read as a whole, that it was intended to have application to the entire judicial system of the state of California, including the Supreme Court and the several District Courts of Appeal; second, that it was intended to confer upon the judicial council certain powers such as are enumerated in subdivisions 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 of section 1a of said amendment; and, third, that it was intended to confer upon the Chairman of the Judicial Council certain powers and duties having reference to whatever state of congestion he may find to exist in the calendars of the courts or judges of this state with a view to a speedy relief of such congestion, and "to expedite judicial business" by so doing.

[2] ID.—POWERS OF ASSIGNED JUDGES—CONSTRUCTION.—The phrase "to assist a court or judge whose calendar is congested," used in the "Judicial Council Amendment" to the constitution, because of its generality and absence of specific application and intendment, sheds but little light upon the proper interpretation to be given the particular provision of the constitution in which it is found, but the implication is clear from the subsequent provision of the amendment, which declares that the several judges thus assigned "to assist a court or judge whose calendar is congested" are to "sit and hold court as assigned," in other words, that said judges shall exercise judicial functions while operating under such assignment.

[3] ID.—ASSIGNMENT OF JUDGES—ACTING AS PART OF COURT.—Judges assigned to assist a court or judge whose calendar is congested, under the "Judicial Council Amendment" to the constitution, exercise their judicial functions under such appointment in the tribunal as constituted by the constitution.

[4] ID.—STATUTORY CONSTRUCTION.—In interpreting the "Judicial Council Amendment" to the constitution, it should be treated as a whole and considered in the light of previous interpretations of the provisions of article VI of the constitution, which it purports to amend; and it should be construed in the light of whatever evils or defects in the administration of justice it is found to have been designed to remedy. Feb. 1927.] FAY v. DISTRICT COURT OF APPEAL. 523

[5] Id.—CHANGE IN LAW—INTENT.—Whatever may have been the intent of the proponent of a particular change in a law must at the last analysis be derived from the language of the proposed enactment purporting to make such change.

[6] Id.—REPEALS BY IMPLICATION.—RULE.—Repeals by implication are not favored and are recognized only when there is an irreconcilable conflict between two or more legislative enactments.

[7] Id.—EXPRESS REPEAL OR MODIFICATION.—When in any enactment there appears an express modification or repeal of certain provisions in a former enactment, such express modification or repeal of the portions thus affected will be held to disclose the full intent of the framers of the later enactment as to how much or what portion of the former it was intended to modify or repeal.

[8] Id.—CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION 6 OF JUDICIAL COUNCIL AMENDMENT. By the terms of section 6 of the "Judicial Council Amendment" to the constitution, the previously existing provisions of the constitution respecting Superior Courts are expressly modified and to that extent repealed in so far as these related to the number of superior judges who might function in said court in the several counties of California.

[9] Id.—ASSIGNMENT OF JUDGES—NUMBER—POWER OF CHAIRMAN OF JUDICIAL COUNCIL.—The express provisions of section 6 of the "Judicial Council Amendment" to the constitution, read in connection with the language of section 1a of said amendment, renders fully applicable the rules forbidding repeals by implication.

[10] Id.—POWER OF CHAIRMAN OF JUDICIAL COUNCIL.—The power with which the Chairman of the Judicial Council is invested, by the "Judicial Council Amendment" to the constitution, is that of assigning judges or justices "to assist" the Supreme Court and the several District Courts of Appeal, as these courts were theretofore constituted under the terms of the constitution prior to said amendment, whenever the calendars of said tribunals have become congested.

[11] Id.—STATUS OF ASSIGNED JUDGES.—In making the assignment of any justice or judge or of any number of them "to assist" the appellate tribunals, the Chairman of the Judicial Council was empowered to invest the persons so selected and assigned with no other or different official relation to such courts than that held by the already regularly constituted members thereof, which

5. See 23 Cal. Jur. 726; 25 R. C. L. 961.
6. See 23 Cal. Jur. 694; 25 R. C. L. 918.
7. See 23 Cal. Jur. 712. 524 FAY v. DISTRICT COURT OF APPEAL. [200 Cal.

was merely that of blending into the group constituency thereof in order, in that relation, to exercise the judicial function.

[12] Id.—JUDGES PRO TEMPORE—CONSTRUCTION OF CONSTITUTION.—Under the "Judicial Council Amendment" of the constitution, it was not only the intention to retain the former constitutional provisions relating to the appointment of justices pro tempore, but to so broaden the former provisions as to authorize the selection of justices or judges pro tempore to assist the Supreme Court and District Courts of Appeal when their calendars were congested, although the regularly constituted justices of said courts who were thus, for the purpose of hearing particular causes or calendars, replaced were neither disqualified nor unable to act.

[13] Id.—STATUTORY CONSTRUCTION.—Between two apparently conflicting interpretations of a law equally adaptable, that one is to be preferred which will give effect to the entire language thereof, rather than that which would destroy any portion of it and to that extent defeat the legislative intent.

[14] Id.—ORDER ASSIGNING JUDGES—CONSTRUCTION OF.—An order made by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, acting ex officio as chairman of the Judicial Council, assigning certain Superior Court judges to assist a District Court of Appeal, if construed to refer to these judges in their individual relation to said court, is a proper exercise of power under the "Judicial Council Amendment" to the constitution.

[15] Id.—ORDER OF DISTRICT COURT OF APPEAL.—An order of the District Court of Appeal which in effect authorizes three Superior Court judges, assigned by the Chairman of the Judicial Council to said court to assist it, as a group, to sit as a court, and not to sit and act in that individual relationship to said court which each of them would otherwise have occupied as justices pro tempore under the terms of the constitution before the "Judicial Council Amendment," is invalid.

RICHARDS, J.—The petitioner herein applies for a writ of review whereby he seeks to have reviewed a certain order made by the District Court of Appeal in and for the Second Appellate District, Division Two, purporting to direct that a certain cause pending upon appeal in said court entitled "The People etc., Plaintiff and Respondent, vs. Fay et al., Defendants and Appellants," be placed upon a calendar of said division of said court for hearing and argument upon a certain date before Honorable Harry R. Archbald, Honorable Elliot Craig and Honorable C. W. Guerin, Judges of the Superior Court of the State of California, in and for the County of Los Angeles, to whom said cause was by the terms of said order assigned for hearing, determination, and judgment. The foregoing order of said court purports to be predicated upon another certain order made by Honorable William H. Waste, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of California, but purporting to act in making said order as chairman of the judicial council of the state of California, and which order reads as follows:

"In the Matter of the Assignment of Judges to Assist the District Court of Appeal, Second Appellate District, Division Two. 526 FAY v. DISTRICT COURT OF APPEAL. [200 Cal.

"It having been made to appear to me by the Honorable Lewis R. Works, presiding justice of the District Court of Appeal, Second Appellate District, Division Two, that the calendar of said court and division is congested:

"Now, therefore, in order to expedite the judicial business of said court, and in accordance with the provisions of that certain amendment to the Constitution of the state (Senate Constitutional Amendment No. 15), ratified and approved by the people of the state at the general election held on November 2, 1926, providing for a judicial council, and authorizing the chairman thereof to assign judges to assist a court or judge whose calendar is congested.

"It is ordered that Honorable Harry R. Archbald, Honorable Elliot Craig, and Honorable C. W. Guerin, judges of the superior court of the state of California in and for the county of Los Angeles, are hereby assigned to sit and hold court as justices of the said District Court of Appeal, Second Appellate District, Division Two, for the period of two weeks beginning Monday, December 20, 1926.

"Dated: San Francisco, California, December 14, 1926.

"WILLIAM H. WASTE,
"Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of California and
Chairman of the Judicial Council."

The petitioner herein also seeks for a writ of prohibition directed to the aforesaid three superior judges, who are also made respondents herein, commanding them and each of them to desist and refrain from acting as justices of the said District Court of Appeal in the said cause wherein the petitioner is one of the appellants; and for such other and further relief as may be meet in the premises.

The manifest purport of the foregoing application for these writs is that of presenting to this court for present determination the interpretation of that certain recently adopted amendment to the constitution of California known as the "Judicial Council Amendment." Said amendment purports to add to article VI of the constitution a new section to be numbered 1a and also to amend sections 6, 7, and 8 of said article VI. Section 1a thereof provides that "There shall be a judicial council," and provides for the constituent members thereof; and that "The chief justice or acting chief justice shall be chairman"; and that the clerk Feb. 1927.] FAX v. DISTRICT COURT OF APPEAL. 527

of the Supreme Court shall act as secretary of the council. It contains certain other provisions to be commented upon in the course of this discussion, but the particular provision requiring present interpretation is that portion of subdivision (6) of said section 1a which reads as follows:

"The chairman shall seek to expedite judicial business and to equalize the work of the judges, and shall provide for the assignment of any judge to another court of a like or higher jurisdiction to assist a court or judge whose calendar is congested, to act for a judge who is disqualified or unable to act, or to sit and hold court where a vacancy in the office of judge has occurred. . . . The several judges shall co-operate with the council, shall sit and hold court as assigned."

Before entering upon the discussion as to the scope and meaning to be given to that portion of section one $a$ of said amendment last above quoted as applied to the immediate situation before us, it may be well to take note of the fact that nowhere in the body of said entire amendment are the designations "Supreme Court" or "District Court of Appeal" made use of as conveying the express intendment of its framers that these appellate tribunals, or either or any of them, should come within its terms. The inference that such was in part its purpose is to be drawn, if at all, from two sources, first, from the fact that the constituent membership of the judicial council is to be made up in part by the designation of the chief justice or acting chief justice of the Supreme Court as its head, and by the selection of one associate justice of said court and of three justices of the District Court of Appeal as part of the membership of said body; and, second, from the very general phraseology of the several provisions of said amendment indicating that its purpose was that of "simplifying and improving the administration of justice," "the expedition of business"; the adoption or amendment of "rules of practice and procedure for the several courts," and the making and receiving of reports "respecting the condition and manner of disposal of judicial business." Notwithstanding this paucity of direct reference in the body of this amendment to the appellate tribunals of this state, it is urged upon us by certain of the proponents thereof, appearing in aid of the respondents to this application, that the main object and purpose of this amendment to the constitution was that of its application to these appellate 528 FAY v. DISTRICT COURT OF APPEAL. [200 Cal.

tribunals, with a view to relieving an existing, and to the minds of some of these an alarming state of congestion in the calendars and judicial business of these tribunals; and that for the attainment of these objects and purposes a most liberal, if not revolutionary, interpretation should be given to its terms. It is further to be noted in this immediate connection that the word "congested" in its application to court calendars is employed but once in the body of said amendment and that in the portion thereof above quoted defining the powers and duties of the chairman of the judicial council in his effort "to expedite judicial business." The extent of such congestion, the tribunals wherein it exists and the precise nature, extent, and duration of such remedial measure as to the framers of this amendment intended the judicial council or its chairman to inaugurate are nowhere dealt with therein outside of the brief paragraph above set forth. Notwithstanding these obvious deficiencies in the way of preciseness of statement as to the tribunals to which its provisions were intended to be applied and also as to the nature and scope of its remedial procedure for the relief of whatever congestion exists in the disposal of judicial business in the courts of last resort, we have arrived at certain preliminary conclusions. [1] They are, first, that it sufficiently appears from the body of his amendment, when read as a whole, that it was intended to have application to the entire judicial system of the state of California, including the Supreme Court and the several District Courts of Appeal; second, that it was intended to confer upon the judicial council certain powers such as are enumerated in subdivisions (1), (2), (3), (4) and (5) of section one $a$ of said amendment; third, that it was intended to confer upon the chairman of the judicial council certain powers and duties having reference to whatever state of congestion he may find to exist in the calendars of the courts or judges of this state with a view to a speedy relief of such congestion, and "to expedite judicial business" by so doing. What is the measure and exercise of these powers and duties by the official to whom they are entrusted is the immediate problem presented in the proceeding before us.

[2] As we have already seen, the language employed in this amendment, "To assist a court or judge whose calendar is congested," because of its generality and absence of spe- Feb. 1927.] FAY v. DISTRICT COURT OF APPEAL. 529

cific application and intendment, sheds but little light upon the proper interpretation to be given to this particular provision thereof under review in the instant proceeding. The phrase "to assist a court or judge whose calendar is congested" is, to say the least, an unfortunate expression in view of the meaning which had already been assigned by this court to a similar phrase in a statute having a similar object. In the case of *People ex rel. v. Hayne*, 83 Cal. 111, 118 [17 Am. St. Rep. 211, 7 L. R. A. 348, 23 Pac. 1], this court construed the phrase "to assist the court" as conferring no judicial functions upon the commissioners provided for by the act of 1889 (Stats. 1889, p. 13); but merely invested the commissioner to be appointed under said act with power to perform such preliminary service in the way of examining causes, searching libraries or even drafting such opinions and conclusions as were preparatory to the order or judgment of the court which could only properly be held to constitute the exercise of its judicial power. It is true that in that case the construction put upon said phrase was constrained by the fact that the legislature had no constitutional power to invest the commissioners provided for in said act with judicial functions, and for that reason the interpretation compelled in that case is not controlling here; but the fact that it was in that earlier case given the foregoing limited interpretation compels us to look beyond its own phrasing for a broader meaning. We find this broader meaning implicable from a succeeding sentence in the same provision, wherein it is declared that the several judges thus assigned "to assist a court or judge whose calendar is congested" are to "sit and hold court as assigned." The implication is thus clear that such judges as are thus assigned shall exercise judicial functions while operating under such assignment.

[3] Having reached this conclusion, we are next brought to the consideration of the tribunal or tribunals wherein the judicial functions of such assigned judges are to be exercised under their said appointment pursuant to the provisions and purposes of this amendment. This brings us to the individual case before us; and while the determination of this cause involves, strictly speaking, only the validity of the order of the Chief Justice, acting as *ex-officio* chairman of the judicial council, and the further order of the presid-

ing justice of Division Two of the District Court of Appeal in and for the Second Appellate District, it also involves a consideration of those sections of article VI of the constitution which relate to the establishment and constituent nature and powers both of the Supreme Court and of the several District Courts of Appeal and of the membership of each; and for this reason we deem it advisable to deal with the problem before us in its present or possible application to the judicial system of California as a whole. The Supreme Court of California was reorganized by the constitution of 1879 and by the incorporation therein of article VI of said constitution. Section 2 of said article provided that "The Supreme Court shall consist of a chief justice and six associate justices." The section further provided for the division of the Supreme Court into departments, with power in the Chief Justice to assign three of the associate justices to each department and to change such assignments from time to time; and that the presence of three justices shall be necessary to transact any business in either of the departments except such as may be done at chambers, and the concurrence of three justices shall be necessary to pronounce a judgment; any four justices may, either before or after judgment by a department, order a case to be heard in bank. The chief justice may convene the court in bank at any time and shall be the presiding justice of the court when so convened. The concurrence of four justices present at the argument shall be necessary to pronounce a judgment in bank; but if four justices so present do not concur in a judgment, then all of the justices qualified to sit in the cause shall hear the argument, but to render a judgment the concurrence of four judges shall be necessary. In case of the absence of the chief justice from the place at which the court is held the associate justices shall select one of their own number to perform the duties and exercise the powers of the chief justice during such absence or inability to act. The foregoing section of article VI of the constitution has remained unchanged in form to the present time and it is to be noted that in said section and also in section 4 of the same article as originally framed there was no provision for the selection of justices or judges pro tempore to act in the place of a justice of the Supreme Court disqualified or unable to act in a cause pending before it. Section 4 of article Feb. 1927.] FAY v. DISTRICT COURT OF APPEAL. 531

VI referred originally to the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and remained in its original form until the year 1904, when said section was so revised as to provide for the organization and jurisdiction of District Courts of Appeal. Three District Courts of Appeal were then created and the jurisdiction of these defined. The jurisdiction of the Supreme Court was also therein redefined in view of the creation of these intermediate tribunals. These District Courts of Appeal as to their constituency and method of action were framed upon the model of the Supreme Court. One of the justices elected or appointed as such to each was to be the presiding justice thereof. The presence of three justices in each was made necessary for the transaction of any business by such court, except such as might be done at chambers, and the concurrence of three justices was made necessary to pronounce a judgment. This amendment to the original section further provided that whenever any justice of the Supreme Court was for any reason disqualified or unable to act in a cause pending before it, the remaining justices might select one of the justices of a District Court of Appeal to act pro tempore in the place of the justice so disqualified or unable to act. The section as amended also contained the provision that whenever any justice of the District Court of Appeal was for any reason disqualified or unable to act in any cause pending before it, the Supreme Court might appoint a justice of the District Court of Appeal of another district or a judge of the superior court to act pro tempore in the place of the justice so disqualified or unable to act. This section as amended also provided for the granting of hearings before the Supreme Court in causes heard and determined by District Courts of Appeal. Section 4 of article VI of the constitution as thus amended remained in the above form until the year 1918, when it was again amended so as to provide for the creation of two additional divisions to be added to the District Courts of Appeal, similarly constituted as to membership and powers, one of which was to form Division Two of the District Court of Appeal in and for the First Appellate District and the other of which was to form Division Two of the District Court of Appeal of the Second Appellate District. This later amendment also provided that in case of the appointment of a justice or justices pro tempore for the Supreme Court such justice 532 FAY v. DISTRICT COURT OF APPEAL. [200 Cal.

or judge *pro tempore* might be selected from among the judges of the superior court as well as from the District Court of Appeal. The section was further amended so as to provide that the presence of two justices should be necessary for the transaction of business in the District Courts of Appeal and the concurrence of two justices in such courts should be necessary to pronounce a judgment. The foregoing sections of article VI of the constitution have since remained in their original or thus amended form up to the time at least of the adoption of the recent amendment to article VI of the constitution here under review.

Before proceeding to consider the provisions of the foregoing sections of article VI of the constitution in the light of the recent amendment it may be timely to take note of certain decisions of the Supreme Court which have an important bearing upon their interpretation. The first of these is that of the very early case of *People v. Wells*, 2 Cal. 198, wherein the question arose as to the power of the legislature to declare that a vacancy existed in the constituent membership of the Supreme Court by reason of the fact that one of its duly elected justices was temporarily absent from the state; and also as to the power of the Governor to appoint a justice to fill such declared vacancy. Chief Justice Murray in a remarkably well-reasoned opinion declared the act of the legislature to be unconstitutional and the appointment by the Governor to be invalid. In so doing he quoted the language of the constitution of 1849, which stated that the Supreme Court of California "shall consist of a chief justice and two associate justices," and held that these words "limit the number and *ex vi terminorum* forbid the possibility of there being more than three." Another case bearing upon the subject is that of *In re Jessup*, 81 Cal. 408, 459 [6 L. R. A. 594, 21 Pac. 976, 22 Pac. 74, 1028], wherein in certain of the later stages of that somewhat famous case this court had occasion to consider the effect of a clause which had been added to section 45 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which provided in substance that the concurrence of five justices of the Supreme Court should be required in order to the granting of a rehearing after a department decision. Chief Justice Beatty, in delivering the opinion of the court upon this question, declared that this provision of the code was invalid as an attempt to Feb. 1927.] FAY v. DISTRICT COURT OF APPEAL. 533

change the constitutional number of the membership of the Supreme Court required to concur in a judgment or order. The case of *Reeve v. Colusa Gas etc. Co.*, 151 Cal. 29 [91 Pac. 802], has also a bearing upon the subject in hand. In that case the matter of the interpretation of the provision which was added to section 4 of article VI of the constitution in 1904, authorizing the substitution of a justice of the District Court of Appeal in the place of a justice of the Supreme Court disqualified or unable to act in a cause pending before it, came up for consideration. The above-entitled case had been decided in department. A rehearing was granted by the court in bank and the cause was placed upon the calendar of the full court for further hearing. In the meantime Justice Sloss had become a member of the court, and, deeming himself disqualified through interest, declined to sit in the case. Justice McFarland was ill and unable to be present at the hearing in bank. Accordingly the court selected Justices Cooper and Harrison of the District Court of Appeal in and for the First Appellate District to act pro tempore, the former in the place of Justice Sloss and the latter in the place of Justice McFarland. The records of this court disclose that said cause was placed upon the calendar of the court in bank for hearing, and was argued upon the twenty-third day of February, 1906, before the court thus constituted; and was decided upon June 21, 1906, by a four to three decision, Justices Shaw, Angellotti, Harrison, and Chief Justice Beatty joining in the main opinion and Justices Henshaw, Lorigan, and Cooper dissenting. A petition for rehearing was filed on July 10, 1906. When such petition came on for judicial action Justice McFarland, having recovered from his illness, was able to function and did so by joining the minority in an order granting a rehearing, on July 19, 1906, in which action Justice Harrison did not participate, but Justice Cooper did, Justice Sloss as to that cause being still disqualified. Thereupon the respondents moved the court to set aside its order granting such rehearing upon the ground that Justice Harrison, sitting pro tempore for Justice McFarland as to that cause, should, and Justice McFarland should not, have acted in the premises. The court, without going deeply into the merits of the matter, on April 4, 1907, decided that the order should stand. The case is interesting not so much on ac- 534 FAY v. DISTRICT COURT OF APPEAL. [200 Cal.

count of what was expressly decided but because of the incidental light which it casts upon the operations of the Supreme Court under the amendment providing for the selection of justices *pro tempore* when one or more of the regularly constituted members of the court were disqualified or unable to act in respect to any cause or matter requiring the exercise of judicial functions. Our records disclose that between February 23, 1906, when Justices Cooper and Harrison were selected to act as justices *pro tempore* in said cause, and April 4, 1907, when the decision of the court upon the motion to set aside its order granting a rehearing was handed down, the Supreme Court functioned as a judicial tribunal frequently with Justices Sloss and McFarland participating in the calling of calendars and decisions of causes other than the Reeves case; and that, in fact, upon the very day, viz., June 21, 1906, upon which the Reeves case was originally decided by the four to three decision of the court in bank above referred to, the Supreme Court in bank decided the case of *People v. Weber* (149 Cal. 325 [86 Pac. 671]), in which decision Justice Sloss participated and Justice Cooper acted as justice *pro tempore* for Justice McFarland, who was still unable to act, but for whom Justice Harrison was still acting in the Reeves case as a justice *pro tempore*. We thus arrive at a cotemporaneous interpretation of the scope and effect of the constitutional provisions permitting the selection of justices *pro tempore* in the Supreme Court and in the District Courts of Appeal prior to the adoption of the most recent amendment here under review. The importance of the foregoing cotemporaneous interpretation of the constitutional provisions relating to justices *pro tempore* becomes apparent when we consider more closely the constituent nature and method of functioning of these two tribunals under the constitution as it stood prior to its recent amendment. Section 2 of article VI provided that "The Supreme Court shall consist of a chief justice and six associate justices." Section 4 of the same article as amended in 1918 provides that the Courts of Appeal for the First and Second Appellate Districts shall each consist of two divisions of three justices each. The court of the Third Appellate District shall consist of three justices. Section 2 of said article defines how the Supreme Court shall perform its judicial functions. The court may sit in departments Feb. 1927.] FAY v. DISTRICT COURT OF APPEAL. 535

and in bank. When the court sits in its departments each of its said departments shall have three associate justices and each of said departments shall have the power to hear and determine causes. The presence of three justices shall be necessary to transact any business in either of the departments, and the concurrence of three justices therein shall be necessary to pronounce a judgment. When the court sits or acts in bank the concurrence of four justices shall be necessary to order a case, heard and decided in department, to be heard in bank; and the concurrence of four justices shall be necessary to pronounce a judgment, provided that if a cause is orally argued in bank the concurrence of four justices who have heard such argument shall be necessary to pronounce a judgment therein. In the creation of the several District Courts of Appeal the same general plan and procedure for the functioning of these courts were followed and the same powers granted with regard to pro tempore justices. It would thus appear that an individual justice of the Supreme Court or of the District Court of Appeal possessed, as such, no power to perform any judicial function other than that to be performed by him as a component member of a group acting either in department or in bank in the Supreme Court or functioning in a like group relation in an appellate court. The persons who were selected to act as justices pro tempore of either court blended into the already constituted entity of which for the time being they were to form a part, and in so doing replaced those individual members of that entity who in relation to particular causes or calendars were disqualified or unable to act. In so doing they "assisted the court"; and it is interesting to note that the plan of calling in pro tempore justices as adopted in 1904 was evidently intended to be one of the ways then devised to relieve "congestions"; since the same amendment which created the District Courts of Appeal for that then much needed relief also provided for the maintenance of the man power of both courts by the selection of justices pro tempore in each as the emergency required. It has, however, never been considered, nor is it now contended, that the power then reposed in the justices of the Supreme Court or of the District Courts of Appeal to make selections of justices or judges to act in the stated emergencies as justices pro tempore, however flexible its operation as disclosed 536 FAY v. DISTRICT COURT OF APPEAL. [200 Cal.

in the Reeves case, could be so indefinitely expanded as to permit either of these tribunals to so far replace its constituent membership as to create or constitute a Supreme Court or a District Court of Appeal so far composed of justices *pro tempore* as to exercise the judicial functions of the regularly constituted tribunal. It has never, for example, been considered, nor is it now contended, that under the terms of the amendments of 1904 or 1918 of the constitution relating to *pro tempore* justices that the members of the Supreme Court or District Courts of Appeal were thereby invested with the power to substitute for themselves, acting as a group in the performance of the judicial function, another body of men composed of justices *pro tempore* and as such empowered to exercise the functions of a Supreme Court or District Court of Appeal. In other words, it was never intended to provide for the creation of *a court pro tempore*. To so interpret these provisions in said amendments, evidently intended to afford temporary and emergency relief, would be to encourage the violation of a very vital principle of popular government which is none other than that of the right of the people of a commonwealth to have their essential rights, liberties, and interests in respect to person and property heard and determined by courts of last resort, the constituent membership of which is composed of public servants of their own selection. That the people might transfer the direct exercise of this selection to those whom they may have chosen to administer the functions of our representative scheme of government is undoubted, but the text of such transfer, whether embodied in a constitution or a statute, should be plain and unambiguous.

[4] Having thus far interpreted the several provisions of article VI of the constitution as these existed prior to the recent amendment of said article known as the "Judicial Council Amendment," we now arrive at the interpretation of said amendment. In so doing we are to treat said amendment as a whole and are to consider it in the light of our foregoing interpretation of the provisions of said article VI of the constitution which it purports to amend. We are of course to endeavor to construe it in the light of whatever evils or defects in the administration of justice we shall find it to have been designed to remedy. In this latter effort we Feb. 1927.] FAY v. DISTRICT COURT OF APPEAL. 537

have not found ourselves greatly aided by considerations supposed to have preceded or even attended the formulation of this measure; nor by suggestions made to the electors through whatever propaganda accompanied its proffer for adoption or rejection by said electorate. [5] Such aids to the interpretation of a written document while available to the courts are not at all to be considered as controlling, since whatever may have been the intent of the proponents of a particular change in a law must at the last analysis be derived from the language of the proposed enactment purporting to effect such change. (Tynan v. Walker, 35 Cal. 634 [95 Am. Dec. 152]; Estate of Young, 123 Cal. 337 [55 Pac. 1011], and cases cited.) When we examine this amendment as a whole we discover that it embodies two main purposes, the first of which in the order of expression is that portion of section one *a* thereof which proceeds to create a judicial council and to invest that body with certain powers and duties chiefly administrative in character, and, in the main, similar to provisions in the statutes of several other states relating to judicial councils. The other purpose disclosed by an inspection of this amendment is that expressed in subdivision (6) thereof which purports to invest the chief justice of the state, acting *ex officio* as chairman of the judicial council, with certain powers and functions through the exercise of which he is to "seek to expedite judicial business and equalize the work of the judges." It is with the scope and method of the exercise of these powers and functions that we are, in the instant proceeding, chiefly, if not wholly, concerned. In entering upon this inquiry we do not feel ourselves bound to choose between the rules defining the divergent paths of strict and liberal interpretation; but if we were so bound we would feel constrained to follow the path of liberality in interpreting and applying the terms of this amendment with a view to aiding in the achievement of its avowed object, viz., that of "expediting judicial business," since as a court of last resort we are more vitally concerned than any other official or unofficial organization in this state in achieving that result. We are not, however, for that reason to neglect or minify those other certain canons of interpretation which should guide and control the courts in determining the extent and limitations of proposed changes in established laws and especially in the organic law. One 538 FAY v. DISTRICT COURT OF APPEAL. [200 Cal.

of the most important of these is that relating to repeals by implication. [6] It is a doctrine of universal acceptation that repeals by implication are not favored in the interpretation of laws. No higher authority for this doctrine need be cited than that of Judge Cooley in his great work on Constitutional Limitations, wherein he thus states the rule and outlines its application: "Repeals by implication are not favored; and the repugnancy between two statutes should be very clear to warrant a court in holding that the later in time repeals the other when it does not in terms purport to do so." (Cooley's Constitutional Limitations, 7th ed., pp. 216, 217, and cases cited.) The rule is even more strongly stated by the latest utterance of this court upon the subject wherein it is declared: "Repeals by implication are not favored and are recognized only when there is an irreconcilable conflict between two or more legislative enactments." (Railroad Com. v. Riley, 192 Cal. 54, 57 [218 Pac. 415, 417], and cases cited.) The older authorities supporting this rule are fully collated in 23 Cal. Jur., pp. 694, 695. [7] The application of this principle to the instant problem is attended with another principle of interpretation of almost equal importance, which is that when in any enactment there appears an express modification or repeal of certain provisions in a former enactment, such express modification or repeal of the portions thereof thus affected will be held to disclose the full intent of the framers of the later enactment as to how much or what portion of the former it was intended to modify or repeal. This upon the principle *expressio unius, est exclusio alterius*; and in such a case an implied modification or repeal of such portions of the former law as are not expressly referred to as being repealed or modified is to be all the more avoided in determining the intent and effect of the latter enactment. (Crosby v. Patch, 18 Cal. 439, 441.) [8] The application of the foregoing principle to the instant situation is this: By the terms of section 6 of said amendment the previously existing provisions of the constitution respecting Superior Courts are expressly modified and to that extent repealed in so far as these related to the number of superior judges who might function in said courts in the several counties of California. [9] This was accomplished by the provision in said section 6 of the amendment stating that "There may be Feb. 1927.] FAY v. DISTRICT COURT OF APPEAL. 539

as many sessions of a superior court at the same time as there are judges elected, appointed or assigned thereto." This express provision read in connection with the language of section one *a* of said amendment would expressly authorize the chairman of the judicial council to increase the number of those who could exercise the judicial function in the superior courts; but there is no such express provision with relation to the appellate courts; and the absence thereof renders fully applicable both of the foregoing rules forbidding repeals by implication. Bearing in mind these salutary rules and bearing in mind also the interpretation which has already been given to the several provisions of article VI of the constitution as they read prior to the recent amendment, we apply ourselves to the specific language of the amendment itself. Subdivision (6) of section one *a* thereof, as we have seen, provides that the chairman of the judicial council in his effort to expedite judicial business "shall provide for the assignment of any judge to another court of like or higher jurisdiction to assist a court or judge whose calendar is congested." The phrase "to assist a court" in the above quotation is the only one with which we are presently concerned, since as to the Supreme and Appellate Courts, it is only such courts which, in their group constituency, as distinguished from the judges or justices thereof, have calendars which could be congested. [10] The power with which the chairman of the judicial council is therefore invested by the foregoing clause in said amendment is that of assigning judges or justices "to assist" the Supreme Court or the several District Courts of Appeal as these courts were theretofore constituted under the terms of the constitution prior to said amendment, whenever the calendars of said tribunals had become congested. It was these courts as thus constituted which were to be thus "assisted"; and the assistance thus to be rendered was to be that supplied through the assignment of a justice or judge not already a constituent member of the court to be thus assisted to be and to act as one of the members thereof; and in the language of a later clause in said section of said amendment to "sit and hold court as assigned." The authority of the judge or justice thus assigned "to sit and hold court" must, however, be interpreted in the light of the already existing provisions of the constitution relating to the 540 FAY v. DISTRICT COURT OF APPEAL. [200 Cal.

constituent nature of each of said tribunals; and since section 2 of article VI had already provided that "The Supreme Court shall consist of a chief justice and six associate justices"; and since section 4 of said article had, as amended in 1904 and 1918, similarly provided that the several District Courts of Appeal or their divisions should consist of three justices each; and since, as we have already seen, these respective tribunals under said constitutional provisions could only function in certain defined groups composed of the individual justices thereof, it would result irresistibly that the judge or justice so assigned by the chairman of the judicial council "to sit and hold court as assigned" could only do so as a member of one or the other of such groups and could only exercise a judicial function in such relationship to the already constituted membership of said courts respectively as would not change or increase the designated number of the constituent membership thereof as fixed by the terms of sections 2 and 4 of said article VI of the constitution as these read prior to said recent amendment; for were it otherwise, necessarily these prior sections of the constitution would to that extent have been by implication repealed. In obedience to the above-stated rule against repeals by implication we should therefore diligently seek for an interpretation of the foregoing clauses in the recent amendment as would not have such effect; and for the like reason we should earnestly endeavor to so construe the same as not to effect any change in the groupings of either of said tribunals or in the number of the departments or divisions thereof as fixed by the provisions of sections 2 and 4 of said article VI of the constitution as these read prior to said recent amendment. From these considerations certain deductions would seem logically to follow. [11] The first of these is that in making the assignment of any justice or judge or of any number of such "to assist" the appellate tribunals the chairman of the judicial council was empowered to invest the persons so selected and assigned with no other or different official relation to such courts than that held by the already regularly constituted members thereof, which, as we have seen, was merely that of blending into the group constituency thereof in order, in that relation, to exercise the judicial function. In other words, the individual justice or judge so assigned was to occupy substan- Feb. 1927.] FAY v. DISTRICT COURT OF APPEAL. 541

tially the same relationship to the already constituted group denominated "the court" as that occupied by justices pro tempore under the terms of article VI of the constitution as it stood prior to such amendment. [12] In stating this conclusion we are not, however, to be understood as holding either that the former provisions of article VI of the constitution relating to justices pro tempore has been repealed or that the change in the constitution wrought by this amendment has not broadened the conditions which, under the constitution as it formerly stood, were a limitation upon the power of appointment of justices pro tempore. As to the first of these suggestions, it would seem to be apparent that it was the express purpose of the framers of this amendment to retain unchanged in their terms, except in one regard, the former constitutional provisions relating to the appointment of justices pro tempore, since by the succeeding sentence of the paragraph of section one *a* immediately under review, the chairman of the judicial council is given power to assign a justice or judge "to act for a judge who is disqualified, or unable to act." When we read this express transfer of power to the chairman of the judicial council to assign justices and judges pro tempore under the precise conditions which attended their selection prior to said amendment and when we consider the same in the light of the preceding clause authorizing the assignment of justices or judges "to assist" these courts, we must assume, in order to give effect to both, that it was the intention of the framers of this amendment to so broaden the former provision as to authorize the selection of justices or judges pro tempore to assist said courts when their calendars were congested, although the regularly constituted justices of said courts who were thus, for the purpose of hearing particular causes or calendars, replaced were neither disqualified nor unable to act. It may be argued against this interpretation that the phrase "to assist a court or judge whose calendar is congested" if given this broader meaning removes the necessity for the succeeding phrase "to act for a judge who is disqualified or unable to act." This argument, it must be conceded, brings us face to face with the following dilemma: If the first above-quoted clause is not to be given the broader meaning above assigned to it, then it becomes merely waste and idle words, since the power to make use of pro tempore 542 FAY v. DISTRICT COURT OF APPEAL. [200 Cal.

judges under the former terms of the constitution would be in nowise changed; on the other hand, as is argued, if said first quoted provision is to be given such broader meaning, then the succeeding clause becomes waste and idle, since it is fully covered under the broader meaning of the preceding grant of power. Confronted with this situation we are reminded that between Scylla and Charybdis the wise Ulysses found safety in a middle course and that we may profit by the ancient example. [13] Between two apparently conflicting interpretations of a law equally adaptable, that one is to be preferred which will give effect to the entire language thereof rather than that which would destroy any portion of it and to that extent defeat the legislative intent. (Civ. Code, sec. 3541; Cuthbert v. Woodman, 185 Cal. 43, 45 [195 Pac. 673].) It is possible to preserve in its entirety the foregoing paragraph in subdivision one $a$ of said amendment with the aforesaid broader significance assigned to the first above-mentioned clause thereof by assigning to the succeeding clause thereof an intent on the part of its framers to transfer the pre-existing power of selecting pro tempore judges, to serve in cases of disqualification or inability to act on the part of those whom they were to replace, from the courts formerly invested with the exercise of such power, to the chairman of the judicial council in the interest of the unification of action in that regard; and that in order to clarify such intent, the particular clause referring to such emergencies and providing for such transfer was inserted in said amendment. Such an interpretation enables us to give effect to the entire provision without the violation of any of the foregoing canons of interpretation. That such an interpretation of the foregoing provisions of the recent amendment, when read as a whole, would be susceptible of practical application we entertain no doubt; and that such an interpretation would involve no necessary repeal by implication or otherwise of the former provisions of the constitution relating to the constituent membership or functioning of either the Supreme Court or District Courts of Appeal we are equally sure. And we would go further and say that such a plan, if put into practical operation, would materially assist said courts in relieving congested calendars, wherever such exist, through increasing the man power of such courts without disturbing either their essential constituency or method Feb. 1927.] FAY v. DISTRICT COURT OF APPEAL. 543

of operation in the dispatch of their judicial business. A case and an illustration may make this more clear. In the matter of *People v. Ruef*, 14 Cal. App. 576 [114 Pac. 48, 54], Chief Justice Beatty in the opinion touching a rehearing in the Supreme Court referred interestingly to the methods of work and of the activities of the members of such court preparatory to the final exercise of the judicial functions of the court itself. In addition thereto it may be said with reference to both the Supreme Court and the several District Courts of Appeal that only a small portion of the time of the individual membership of each of said courts is, during any period, occupied in such group action as that of hearing calendars or handing down opinions. During the greater portion of the year the individual members of these courts are occupied in chambers; in examining briefs and records; in library research; in preparing opinions or reviewing those of their associates similarly prepared. These essential labors may be and frequently in the past have been performed by individual justices in cases in which they were qualified to act while their associates with the aid of justices *pro tempore* sitting in their places were occupied in calling calendars or hearing arguments in which they were disqualified to act, or in which for one reason or another they were unable to be present in court session. The case of *Reeve v. Weber*, *supra*, well illustrates the flexibility of the provisions of the constitution relating to justices *pro tempore* prior to the recent amendment; and we can see no serious obstacle in the way of so far enlarging that flexibility as to permit justices or judges, sitting and acting in a *pro tempore* relation to the regularly constituted courts, performing similar functions when the regularly elected or appointed members thereof are neither disqualified nor unable to act. The putting into operation of such a plan would seem to be merely a matter of routine and as such within the entire control of the members of these courts using the same for the more efficient dispatch of judicial business and the relief of congested calendars, without in any way disturbing the constituent organization of such courts as ordained by the constitution prior to the adoption of said amendment.

[14] When this much has been concluded it would seem to logically follow that the order made by the chief justice acting *ex officio* as chairman of the judicial council in assign- 544 FAY v. DISTRICT COURT OF APPEAL. [200 Cal.

ing Superior Judges Archbald, Craig, and Guerin "to assist the District Court of Appeal, Second Appellate District, Division Two," may be upheld as a proper exercise of his powers under the terms of said amendment. It is contended that the use in said order of the phrase to the effect that the judges so assigned "are hereby assigned to sit and hold court as justices of the District Court of Appeal" goes beyond the granted powers of that official under the terms of said amendment as the same has been herein interpreted; but this phrase, if construed to refer to these judges in their individual relation to said court, is subject to no such objection. The difficulty with this proceeding springs not from the order of the chairman of the judicial council above referred to, but from the interpretation sought to be placed thereon by the division of the District Court of Appeal to which these judges have been so assigned. [15] Pursuant to such assignment the said Second Division of said District Court of Appeal made an order that the particular cause wherein the petitioner herein is an appellant be placed on the calendar of said division for hearing and argument before the aforesaid three superior judges, to whom, as said order reads, "the said cause is hereby assigned for hearing, determination and judgment." It thus appears as the necessary effect of the foregoing order that the three superior judges so individually assigned to assist said division of the District Court of Appeal are to sit and act not in that individual relationship to said court which each of them would otherwise have occupied as justices pro tempore under the terms of the constitution as it formerly read and as we have herein construed it to mean, but in an entirely different relationship, viz., that of a group of justices pro tempore sitting as a court, performing all of the judicial functions of a court and particularly performing all of the judicial functions of a division of said Court of Appeal. It would seem plain that in thus setting up what is in effect a new group of justices who are to thus sit and act as a court and in effect as a division of said court, the District Court of Appeal, so attempting to do, could be upheld in such action only upon the theory that the provisions of section 4 of article VI of the constitution, as amended in 1918, have by implication been repealed in so far as those provisions declare that there shall be but two divisions of said District Feb. 1927.] FAY v. DISTRICT COURT OF APPEAL. 545

Court of Appeal. Again referring to the principle that repeals by implication are not favored and to the special application of such principles to cases wherein the suggested and altogether implied repeal is revolutionary in its character and effect, we have earnestly sought for an interpretation of the provisions of section one *a* of said amendment which would entail no such extreme consequences, and which would yet enable said provision to be given such operation and effect as would suffice to accomplish the purposes which prompted its adoption. Such an interpretation is the one already herein declared, which involves no material repeal or alteration in the previous provisions of the constitution; and which, if given operation in the spirit of liberality and flexibility with which the previous changes in the organic law relating to justices *pro tempore* have been construed and applied, but with the broader scope in one respect which we think this amendment in its application to appellate tribunals permits, would in our opinion be productive of the desired result. This result would be to permit assigned justices or judges under the amendment to function as justices or judges *pro tempore* functioned under the provisions of the constitution as they existed prior to the amendment, with the added right to so function in causes wherein the regular justices so replaced were neither disqualified nor unable to act. The assistance so afforded would seem to meet the necessity for added man power in such courts as is contended for by counsel for respondents and at the same time not disturb the operations of the regularly constituted court, as contended for by counsel for petitioner.

We therefore hold that the order of Division Two of the District Court of Appeal in and for the Second Appellate District in so far as it undertakes to authorize Judges Archbald, Craig, and Guerin to sit and act in the group relation of a court and of a division of said District Court of Appeal and in such relation and capacity to hear, determine, and adjudge the case of the appellant and petitioner herein pending upon appeal in said District Court of Appeal is invalid; that such order of said division of said court should upon this application for a writ of review be annulled; and that a writ of prohibition should issue enjoining and prohibiting the respondents Archbald, Craig, and Guerin from exercising the judicial functions of a court and from hear-

ing, determining, and adjudging the cause of the appellant and petitioner herein in that capacity and under the direction of said invalid order.

The said order is annulled and a writ of prohibition is ordered to issue accordingly.

THE PEOPLE ex rel., Appellant, v. TURLOCK HOME TELEPHONE AND TELEGRAPH COMPANY (a Corporation), Respondent.

[1] MUNICIPAL CORPORATIONS—TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES—ACTION TO FORFEIT FRANCHISE—ISSUES.—In a proceeding by the state, upon the relation of a municipality, to forfeit a franchise granted by the municipality to erect and operate over its streets poles, masts, and other structures upon which to suspend wires and other appliances for the construction and maintenance of a telephone and telegraph system, the question of what the rights of the defendant are under section 536 of the Civil Code, if that section is still in force, and whether that section has been repealed by section 19 of article XI of the constitution as amended in 1911, is not involved.

[2] ID.—PLEADING—FORFEITURE.—It is elementary that forfeitures are never favored by the courts, and in order to declare a forfeiture the allegations of the complaint and its proof in support thereof must be positive and explicit.

[3] ID.—FAILURE TO PAY TAX—INSUFFICIENCY OF COMPLAINT.—In such a case, where a forfeiture is sought to be declared by reason of the defendant's failure to pay a franchise tax on certain of its gross earnings, the complaint is fatally defective in failing to show that the defendant has received earnings, and a general demurrer to the complaint was properly sustained for that reason; but as the defect may be overcome by amendment, the

Samuel V. Cornell for Respondent.

Pillsbury, Madison & Sutro, *Amici Curiae*, for Respondent.

CURTIS, J.—This is a proceeding instituted in the name of the People of the State of California upon the relation of the City of Turlock, a municipal corporation, for a judgment declaring forfeited a certain franchise held by the defendant. The amended complaint alleges that the franchise involved herein was granted by said City of Turlock on the sixteenth day of March, 1909, to J. L. Randolph, his successors and assigns, for a term of fifty years, to erect and operate over the streets of said city poles, masts, and other structures upon which to suspend wires and other appliances for the construction and maintenance of a telephone and telegraph system; that Randolph at some time subsequent to January 1, 1912, assigned and transferred said franchise to defendant; that defendant is the owner, holder, and user of said franchise; and that defendant at all times since the expiration of the five-year period subsequent to the granting of said franchise has paid to the City of Turlock its annual two per cent franchise tax on its gross earnings, except that portion of its gross earnings derived from performing switch service for the farmers' telephone lines that connect with the lines of the defendant at the corporate limits of said city. It is also alleged that said two per cent tax is a tax provided for and required by section 3 of the act known as the Broughton Act. A general demurrer to this amended complaint was sustained by the court without 548 PEOPLE v. TURLOCK HOME TEL. ETC. Co. [200 Cal.

leave to amend, and judgment was entered in favor of defendant. From this judgment the plaintiff has appealed. [1] The principal argument advanced by respondent before the trial court in support of its demurrer, and the one mainly relied upon before this court to sustain the judgment herein, is that by virtue of the provisions of section 536 of the Civil Code telephone corporations are given the right to construct telephone lines along and upon the streets and highways of the municipalities of the state; and that under the provisions of said section of the code respondent is given the right to operate and maintain its telephone system over the streets and highways of the City of Turlock independent of any right it may have acquired under the Randolph franchise. Appellant replies to this argument of respondent by contending that section 536 of the Civil Code has been repealed by section 19 of article XI of the constitution as amended in 1911. Much of the briefs of the parties is taken up with a discussion of the merits of these respective contentions. We question whether the validity of section 536 of the Civil Code is material to any issue involved in this proceeding. This action was not brought to exclude the respondent, the Telephone Company, from the use of the streets and highways of the City of Turlock, but simply to declare forfeited the Randolph franchise, which, it is alleged in the amended complaint, the respondent now owns and holds and is using in said city. It may well be that the respondent, under section 536 of the Civil Code, if said section is still in force, has a right to maintain its telephone system in said city, but this right, whatever it may be, as respondent contends, is entirely apart from, and independent of, any right acquired by it by virtue of the ownership of the Randolph franchise. Conceding, therefore, that the rights of respondent under section 536 of the Civil Code are sufficient to protect it in the maintenance and operation of its telephone system in said city, still that fact presents no reason sufficient to defeat appellant's claim to have the Randolph franchise, an entirely different right, forfeited, if it can be shown that the respondent has failed to comply with the law under which the latter franchise was granted, and which failure worked a forfeiture thereof. Section 3 of the Broughton Act provides: "In the event said payment (2 per cent of the gross annual receipts) is not made, said Feb. 1927.] PEOPLE v. TURLOCK HOME TEL. ETC. Co. 549

franchise shall be forfeited; . . . " (Stats. 1905, p. 777.) If section 536 of the Civil Code is held to be still in force, the difference between the rights which respondent is granted by the terms thereof and those which it has under the Randolph franchise may be very slight. As the Randolph franchise is not set out in the amended complaint and the reference thereto in said pleading is quite brief, we have no means of knowing its exact provisions. We hardly think, however, we would be justified in assuming that the rights acquired by respondent thereunder are the same as those given under the code section. On the other hand, it appears from the amended complaint that respondent is now not only the owner but the user of said franchise and that it is paying to the City of Turlock by reason of its ownership and use thereof a franchise tax of two per cent on certain of its gross earnings. Of course, if respondent were exercising no rights under the Randolph franchise, other than those given to it by the Civil Code, provided said code section is still in force, it would be an idle act to declare a forfeiture of the franchise and it would be useless to prolong this litigation, but the facts, as they are set forth in the amended complaint, do not justify us in drawing any such conclusion. We must assume, therefore, that the facts as pleaded show that the respondent is claimed to be exercising some rights under said Randolph franchise in addition to those acquired by it under section 536 of the Civil Code. Whatever those rights are, the appellant seeks to have declared forfeited, and that is all appellant can recover in this proceeding, should it be successful.

[2] Under these circumstances, if the pleadings were otherwise sufficient, the judgment of the court should be reversed and the trial court directed to overrule the demurrer. There is, however, another question presented by the pleadings which we think cannot be passed by without notice. This proceeding is one to declare a forfeiture. It is elementary that forfeitures are never favored by the courts and in order to declare a forfeiture, the allegations of the complaint and the proof in support thereof must be positive and explicit. [3] Appellant seeks to have the Randolph franchise forfeited by reason, we may surmise, of respondent's failure to pay the two per cent franchise tax on certain of the gross earnings, that is, on the gross earn- 550 HERSHEY v. RECLAMATION DISTRICT No. 108. [200 Cal.

ings received by respondent for performing switch services for the farmers' telephone lines that connect with respondent's lines at the corporate limits. But there is no allegation whatever to be found in the amended complaint that any earnings have ever been received by respondent for such switch services. We cannot even infer from the allegation that the respondent has paid the tax on all earnings received by it except on earnings received for switch services that any earnings whatever have been received by respondent for such switch services. The amended complaint is fatally defective in failing to show that the respondent has received earnings for said switch service and the general demurrer thereto was rightly sustained, but as it is a defect that may be overcome by amendment, appellant should have an opportunity to further amend the complaint. In justice to the trial court we would say that as far as the record shows this defect was not called to its attention at the time of the argument on the demurrer. The parties, it appears, addressed themselves exclusively to the question as to whether section 536 of the Civil Code has been repealed.

It is ordered that the judgment be reversed and appellant be given ten days after the going down of the *remittitur* to further amend the complaint.

CORNELIA A. HERSHEY, as Administratrix, et al., Appellants, v. RECLAMATION DISTRICT No. 108 et al., Respondents.

[1] RECLAMATION DISTRICTS—ASSESSMENT FOR RECLAMATION AND IRRIGATION—APPLICATION OF SECTION 3455, POLITICAL CODE.—Section 3455 of the Political Code, as amended in 1917 and 1919 (Stats. 1917, p. 1197, and Stats. 1919, p. 604), is applicable to proceedings taken by the trustees and officers of a reclamation district, which is within the Sacramento and San Joaquin Drainage District, for the levying of an assessment for reclamation and irrigation purposes. Feb. 1927.] HERSHEY v. RECLAMATION DISTRICT No. 108. 551

[2] Id.—PLEADINGS—FRAUD.—Fraud is never to be presumed, but it must be affirmatively pleaded and proved, or the facts from which it is to be inferred must be of such character that no other reasonable conclusion may be reached but the single one of evil design on the part of the person or entity whose acts are attempted to be impugned.

[3] Id.—OBJECTION TO ASSESSMENT—SECTION 3462, POLITICAL CODE.—Section 3462 of the Political Code requires an objector to an assessment for reclamation and irrigation to specify the grounds of objection to the assessment, and unless this be done the decision of the board of supervisors becomes final, and the assessment list is conclusive evidence that said assessment has been made and levied according to law.

[4] Id.—PLANS FOR RECLAMATION—APPROVAL BY STATE RECLAMATION BOARD—SECTION 3455, POLITICAL CODE.—Under section 3455 of the Political Code, the action of the state board of reclamation in approving, modifying, or rejecting any original, supplementary or new plan of reclamation, after a hearing as therein provided, is final, and thereafter the sufficiency of such plans cannot be attacked either before the reclamation board or in any court.

[5] Id.—CONSTITUTIONAL LAW.—The provisions of section 3455 of the Political Code deny to the property owners no constitutional right.

[6] Id.—STATUTES—CONSTITUTIONAL OBJECTIONS—WAIVER—ESTOPPEL. The right to question the constitutionality of a statute may be waived; and it is a general rule applicable in civil cases that a constitutional question must be raised at the earliest opportunity or it will be considered as waived. One who receives a benefit from an unconstitutional law is estopped from asserting its unconstitutionality.

[7] Id.—CREATION OF RECLAMATION AND IRRIGATION DISTRICTS—POWER OF LEGISLATURE.—The legislature has the power to create, by special acts, reclamation or irrigation districts; and it has the power to merge or consolidate into a unified system two established systems of bringing arid and swamp and overflowed lands into a state of cultivability and productiveness.

[8] Id.—RECLAMATION DISTRICT No. 108—CREATION AND POWERS OF.—Reclamation District No. 108 exists as a creature of special statutory enactments, and it is given broad powers in addition to the powers conferred by general laws.

[9] Id.—AMENDMENT OF 1917—APPLICATION OF POLITICAL CODE.—All reclamation districts existing in this state at the time of and

prior to the 1917 amendment formed under any statute of the state were subject to the provisions of the Political Code relating to reclamation districts just as though such districts had been formed by or created under the provisions of the code relating to swamps and overflowed, salt marsh, and tide lands.

[10] Id.—SECTION 3455, POLITICAL CODE—TITLE OF ACT AMENDING.—The title of the act amending section 3455 of the Political Code was expressive of the subject of the act if the term "reclamation" can be said to be sufficiently comprehensive to include irrigation.

[11] Id.—RECLAMATION AND IRRIGATION—STATUTORY CONSTRUCTION.—The two methods to reclaim land, to wit, draining overflowed lands and supplying water to dry and arid lands, are germane to a general purpose and in accord with the policy of the government; and the term "reclamation" in a statute is sufficiently broad and comprehensive to include the irrigation of lands which are rendered excessively dry and arid in the summer season by reason of the shutting out of the storm and flood water of winter.

[12] Id.—ASSESSMENTS—INTEREST—APPEAL.—It will be presumed on appeal in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that the officers of a reclamation district in computing interest on past expenses to be included in an assessment, computed it on a basis not exceeding its legal rate; and the trial court having heard the evidence addressed to the issues and having found thereon, its finding will not be interfered with on appeal unless, as a matter of law, it appears to be erroneous.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Superior Court of Colusa County. George H. Thompson, Judge Presiding. Affirmed.

The facts are stated in the opinion of the court.

Clark, Nichols & Eltse for Appellants.

Thomas Rutledge and Devlin & Devlin for Respondents. Feb. 1927.] HERSHEY v. RECLAMATION DISTRICT No. 108. 553

SEAWELL, J.—Ella L. Hershey, one of the original plaintiffs, having died, Cornelia A. Hershey and Davidella Hershey, as administratrices of her estate, have been substituted in her place and stead. This is an attack made by plaintiffs upon assessment No. 5 levied upon land situate within Reclamation District No. 108, located in Yolo and Colusa Counties, the easterly boundary line of which is the Sacramento River. The district comprises approximately 60,000 acres of land. [1] Said Reclamation District being within the Sacramento and San Joaquin drainage district, section 3455 of the Political Code, as amended (Stats. 1917, p. 1197, and Stats. 1919, p. 604), is made applicable to the proceedings taken by the trustees and officers of the district, which proceedings constitute the basis of the assessment sought to be invalidated by this proceeding. Plaintiffs' lands included within the limits of the district consist of approximately 2,500 acres and were assessed for both reclamation and irrigation purposes. The lands were assessed in two parcels, and were designated as tracts number 9 and 10, respectively. Tract number 9 contains 2,377 acres and was assessed in the sum of $163,175.55; number 10 contains approximately 123 acres and was assessed in the sum of $467.25. The two parcels are contiguous. The action was brought against said Reclamation District and its officers and two hundred other owners in the district, numbered from 1 to 200, both inclusive.

The report to the board of supervisors upon which the assessment proceedings are based is dated March 1, 1923, and was filed with the board of supervisors of the county of Colusa on March 31, 1923. It contains the plan of reclamation and the estimates upon which the assessment is asserted. Judgment in the court below went against the plaintiffs and this appeal is from the judgment as entered.

In addition to the formal allegations of the complaint it is alleged that on March 1, 1923, the trustees of said district made an alleged order purporting to adopt certain plans and new, amendatory, supplemental, and additional plans for the reclamation and irrigation of lands within Reclamation District No. 108, together with alleged estimates of the cost of past and contemplated reclamation and irrigation works of the district, including incidental expenses and al- 554 HERSHEY v. RECLAMATION DISTRICT No. 108. [200 Cal.

leged maintenance and repairs thereof, and that said plans and estimates contained statements that the improvements made were necessary to the reclamation and irrigation of the lands of the district. The complaint alleges the filing by the board of trustees of the requisite number of copies of the original plans and estimates with the board of supervisors of the county of Colusa, the certification and transmission of copies thereof to the state reclamation board and the making of a purported order by the latter board approving the same and the subsequent making of a purported order by the board of supervisors of the county of Colusa appointing three commissioners of assessment to levy an assessment and apportion the same according to the benefits that would accrue to each tract of land; the making up of the assessment lists showing the amounts stated in said estimates; the fixing of the time when objections would be heard; the publication of notice thereof and the levying of the final assessments against plaintiffs' lands, which aggregated the sum of $163,642.80. Proceeding, the complaint alleges the filing of written objections to said assessments and the overruling of the same by the board of supervisors of the county of Colusa, which body then and there made an order approving and affirming said assessments. Thereafter the original list was filed with the county treasurer of the county of Colusa and a certified copy was filed with the county treasurer of the county of Yolo. The objections to the assessment alleged to have been filed by plaintiffs with the board of supervisors are set forth in the complaint and constitute practically the balance of the pleading. First, a repudiation of any liability springing from the assessment was made upon the ground that the costs and expenses of the reclamation and irrigation project were not apportioned according to the benefits that had accrued or would accrue, but that said apportionment was, as to plaintiffs' lands, unequal, excessive, and unfair as compared with the assessments imposed upon the lands of others similarly subject to taxation. The assessment is also contested upon the grounds that the commissioners imposed upon plaintiffs' land charges amounting to about $20 per acre for costs and charges theretofore incurred in the construction, operation, and maintenance of irrigation works and incidental expenses incurred in connection with such works and charges for Feb. 1927.] HERSHEY v. RECLAMATION DISTRICT No. 108. 555

interest on indebtedness incurred in constructing, maintaining, and operating said works and about $10 additional per acre for the construction of additional irrigation works and the maintenance thereof and for additional expenses to be incurred in connection with future works and the operation and maintenance thereof, which works have not benefited and will not benefit plaintiffs' lands. It was also made a ground of objection that the whole of said expenses incurred or to be incurred were for the benefit of lands other than the lands of plaintiffs and that plaintiffs' lands do not in any sense need irrigation; that the charges imposed upon said lands for irrigation works and irrigation expenses are disproportionate to the benefits that have or will accrue to the same; that said plans and estimates purport to show estimates of amounts expended and to be expended upon (a) the back levee of the district; (b) drainage works, including pumping plants; (c) power plants; (d) irrigation works and an irrigation system and the expenses of the construction, maintenance and incidental expenses thereof; (e) incidental expenses of such works. It is also made a ground of written objection that said estimates were and are excessive and untrue and relate to things and represent and include expenses which were not made for the work of reclamation or the irrigation of the lands of said district, and therefore there was no authority to incur the same. The court found that the foregoing objections pleaded were not filed with the board of supervisors, but others, less elaborate and specific, which are hereafter summarized, were filed. Concluding this subject, the complaint proceeds by alleging that the plans and estimates do not, upon the face of either, show such invalid charges, but they were known to the defendants and unknown to plaintiffs and can only be ascertained by bringing the defendants into court; that said plans and estimates as to certain items of reclamation and irrigation fail to show with any degree of certainty the nature of the work done or where the work, if done, was in fact done; that the commissioners in levying the assessment could not, in the case of the estimates or statements of expenditures relating to certain items [(a) to (e), inclusive], determine from said plans and estimates the nature or purpose of large amounts of expenses that were included in the total estimates for work done or to be done and said commissioners 556 HERSHEY v. RECLAMATION DISTRICT No. 108. [200 Cal.

were compelled to ascertain from the engineer of the district the nature of work done or to be done in order to make said estimates; that said facts were not ascertainable from an inspection of the plans and estimates by the land owners and could only be known by a full and careful accounting and hearing in a court action; that the expenses complained of and charged against plaintiffs' lands are not shown in any plans or estimates showing the nature of the work; that plaintiffs' lands were assessed with large sums on account of interest accrued or thereafter to accrue on expenses incurred. It is claimed that it is impossible to ascertain from the face of the plans and estimates what periods of time are covered by said estimates of expenses on account of interest accrued or to accrue or to determine the amount that should have been included in said assessment as accrued or unaccrued future interest. It is alleged that large amounts of the various sums which go to make up the assessment consist of expenses that were not for maintenance or repair, but were expenses upon new, supplemental, and additional plans of reclamation and irrigation that were never adopted or made the plans of the district prior to the time said expenses were incurred; that large expenses were charged on plaintiffs' lands without being segregated or separately stated in said plans, and are mixed and confused with expenditures laid out on plans and estimates previously adopted, and that a large portion of the expenses contained in said estimates were incurred without the prior making, adopting, approving, or filing of any plans and estimates for said contemplated expenditures. This, it is alleged, applied particularly to the Knight's Landing power plant built and equipped at a cost of about $200,000, which was never of any benefit or use to plaintiffs' lands and which has since been discontinued. In general language objection is made to every item of reclamation and irrigation included in the estimated costs of construction, estimated maintenance costs, estimated drainage operation costs, estimated irrigation costs and incidental expenses and all charges for maintenance or repair of such work. Large sums of money are alleged to have been expended and heavy expenses incurred on new, supplemental, and additional plans without the prior adoption, filing, or approving of the same and said plans and estimates contain no showing as to when warrants were is- Feb. 1927.] HERSHEY v. RECLAMATION DISTRICT No. 108. 557

sued or the purpose thereof or as to the times of incurring said expenses. It is complained that the incidental expenses mentioned in the reports and estimates are grossly excessive and those claimed to have been incurred were not described and, it is charged, the estimate was made in a lump sum for the purpose of concealing expenditures of moneys made in a manner not authorized by law. It is alleged that the plans and estimates were adopted by the trustees of the district pursuant to a purpose and plan to compel the commissioners of assessment to relieve the lands of the River Farms Company, a corporation, and others of heavy burdens that had been imposed upon their lands by reason of the adoption of plans of reclamation and irrigation that had proven unwise and had failed and which far exceeded in cost the estimate of the district engineer; that pursuant to said plan of favoritism said River Farms Company's lands were relieved of a large amount of said expense which was superimposed upon plaintiffs' lands; that one of the trustees who voted to adopt the plans was president or manager of and a stockholder in said River Farms Company. Finally it is alleged that neither the board of trustees of said district, nor the state reclamation board, nor the board of supervisors of the county of Colusa had jurisdiction to make any order or orders of any kind with respect to the plans and estimates referred to in said complaint and said commissioners of assessment were without jurisdiction to make any assessment upon said lands of plaintiffs.

The prayer is that the court shall make and enter its decree setting aside, canceling, and annulling and holding to be invalid the assessment so made. The foregoing is a full and fair résumé of the material allegations of the complaint.

By their answer defendants aver the adoption by the board of trustees of said district, on or about May 1, 1923, of plans for the reclamation and irrigation of land in Reclamation District No. 108, together with estimates of the cost of the work to be done, and already done, including maintenance and repair thereof. They aver that said plans and costs were necessary in the reclamation and irrigation of said lands. The approval of the plans and estimates by the reclamation board of the state of California and the acceptance of the same, the order of the board of supervisors 558 HERSHEY v. RECLAMATION DISTRICT No. 108. [200 Cal.

approving the assessment and the taking of the necessary steps in all stages of the proceedings required to give validity to the assessment are pleaded. They deny that prior to the date of the hearing of the objections to said assessment the objections were made as alleged by plaintiffs, and allege that many objections set forth in the complaint were not contained in the written objections. Defendants aver that the commissioners in assessing plaintiffs' land apportioned the cost of reclamation works, including irrigation works, in proportion to the benefits accrued or that would accrue upon each tract of land, and that the assessment levied upon plaintiffs' lands was not excessive or unequal as compared with other lands. They aver that no amount or sum was imposed upon plaintiffs' lands for or as charges theretofore incurred in the construction or operation or maintenance of irrigation works, or incidental expenses in connection therewith, or for interest on indebtedness incurred in constructing, maintaining, or operating such works, or any sum for the construction of additional irrigation works or the maintenance thereof or for incidental expenses to be incurred in connection with the future operation or maintenance of the same. It is averred that plaintiffs need irrigation and will be benefited by the works set forth in the plans. It is alleged that the plans and estimates were taken by the commissioners as an entirety and that the assessment was assessed against each tract of land in proper proportion to the benefits that have accrued or will accrue to the same, and that said assessment against each tract of plaintiffs' lands was made in one entire sum. They deny that any invalid charges were included in said assessment and aver that said plans and estimates set forth with certainty the work done, its nature, and the cost and expenses of each piece of work, and that said commissioners and all other persons could determine from said plans and estimates all things and matters of whatsoever kind necessary to the making of the assessments and which were included therein. They deny that the commissioners were compelled to or did rely upon the engineer for the information as to the nature of the work to be done, and deny that plaintiffs' lands were assessed with any sum on account of interest then accrued or to accrue on any expenses which had theretofore accrued. Uncertainty as to the period of time covered by interest Feb. 1927.] HERSHEY v. RECLAMATION DISTRICT No. 108. 559

charges, the rate charged, accrued, or to accrue is denied. It is averred that no estimate was made on plans or works of reclamation or irrigation which were adopted before the expenses were incurred and that all the work done as set forth in the plans and estimates was necessary and was done in accordance with the requirements of the same and was for the benefit of plaintiffs' lands. Favoritism shown or extended to the River Farms Company, or any land owner whatsoever, or unwise or improper action or conduct on the part of the district or its officers is likewise denied. As a second defense the order of the state reclamation board made April 24, 1923, approving the plans and estimates of said Reclamation District No. 108, and which has not since been vacated, annulled or modified, is pleaded. For a third defense the order of the board of supervisors of the county of Colusa made December 6, 1923, approving the assessment attacked by the complaint is set up as an estoppel against all objections not specifically made by the plaintiffs in their written objections filed with said board of supervisors.

The trial court made elaborate findings upholding the validity of the assessment. The proceedings, beginning with the plans adopted by the board of trustees of the district March 2, 1923, are set forth in chronological order. The written objections to the assessment of plaintiffs, as actually made, are set out in their numerical order. The first five objections challenge the jurisdiction of the board of supervisors, trustees of the district, and commissioners of assessment, respectively, to make the preliminary orders and perform the acts and duties necessary to lay the foundation of a valid assessment. No. 6 attacks the plans and estimates on the ground that they do not represent a fair or reasonable scheme of reclamation and were so devised as to prevent a fair apportionment of costs and expenses in proportion to benefits accruing to each tract of land. No. 7 protests against an attempt to impose upon plaintiffs' lands charges for an irrigation system, and complaint is made that no system had been devised for the irrigation of their lands and said lands had not been irrigated, and, further, the assessment was an effort to charge their lands and the lands of others with an expense due to the mistakes of those who originated the irrigation works and canal system. No. 8 rests upon the assertion that the plans are insufficient and 560 HERSHEY v. RECLAMATION DISTRICT No. 108. [200 Cal.

do not adequately describe the work done or proposed to be done. The same objection is made as to the estimates of expenses. Objection is also made that the assessment contains large amounts imposed upon plaintiffs' lands for work done under plans that were never adopted or approved, and that neither the plans for reclamation or irrigation have been adequately adopted or sanctioned. Objection No. 9 insists that the assessment was not made or spread in proportion to the entire amount raised by the levy, and was unfairly and inequitably levied, and plaintiffs' assessment is, therefore, greater than their proportionate share should be. No. 10 avers that the value of plaintiffs' land will not be enhanced in proportion to the amount of the assessment; that the alleged improvements have not improved said lands; that the tracts of land on behalf of which the scheme of irrigation was proposed and originated and which are benefited thereby should be charged with the costs and expenses of irrigation construction and maintenance and the "lands which never desired irrigation and the owners of which never sought irrigation" should not be loaded with the vast unforeseen expenses since sought to be avoided or lessened by the original projectors of the scheme, by bringing in plaintiffs and others as burden bearers.

The court found that the proceedings leading up to and including the levy and assessment were regular and legal; that said lands were assessed in proportion to the benefits to be derived from the expenditures of money set forth in said plans as the estimated cost of the work; that the commissioners did not impose any separate sum or charge whatever upon plaintiffs' lands or any part thereof for charges theretofore incurred in the construction or operation or maintenance of irrigation works or incidental expenses or interest on indebtedness incurred in the construction, maintenance, or operation of such works, or for the construction of additional irrigation works or for the maintenance or incidental expenses thereof in connection with future works. As to the estimates for interest, the following is taken from said plans and estimates as incorporated in the findings:

"Estimates of Costs.

"In the following tabulation is given the total estimated cost of all works included in these plans of Reclamation District No. 108 to be completed or acquired after July 27, Feb. 1927.] HERSHEY v. RECLAMATION DISTRICT No. 108. 561

1917. This total estimated cost as shown for each item includes interest estimated on the outstanding expenditures for such item and the expenditures to be hereafter made in connection with such item up to the date of the estimated time that will be required to levy, equalize and collect upon the assessment to be hereafter made in accordance with these plans and estimates, the District having no funds available for the payment of the outstanding warrants or warrants to be hereafter issued until collection can be made on said assessment to be hereafter made."

It is found that no amount was included in said plans and estimates of said assessment for expenses which were not for maintenance or repair; that each expense was segregated or separately stated as required by law; that each piece of work referred to in the complaint was done for the benefit of said district and the lands therein, including plaintiffs', and the assessment was in all respects and as to all lands within the district fairly and lawfully made and levied. The court, in short, found against plaintiffs and in favor of defendants upon every material issue made by the pleadings.

[2] The complaint makes no charge of felonious misappropriation or embezzlement of the funds of the district and the allegations of improper application of the funds of the district, if, indeed, they may be regarded as sounding in fraud, rest upon doubtful implications flowing from the general language of the pleading rather than upon direct and positive allegations. Fraud is never to be presumed, but it must be affirmatively pleaded and proved, or the facts from which it is to be inferred must be of such character that no other reasonable conclusion may be reached but the single one of evil design on the part of the person or entity whose acts are attempted to be impugned. We conclude from the pleadings that it is not the claim of the plaintiffs that the moneys which came into the hands of the officers of the district were feloniously misappropriated by them or were not applied to the payment of reclamation and irrigation works and the maintenance and repair of the project and on account of interest, but that certain of the expenditures made were not authorized by law. Favoritism is alleged to have been shown to the River Farms Company, but no satisfactory evidence was adduced at the trial to sustain the allegation and the court found against plaintiffs on that

issue. The written objections actually filed by plaintiffs with the board of supervisors are not specific, but are set forth in the most general terms.

[3] Plaintiffs at no time, either by the complaint herein or the written objections filed with the board of supervisors, requested a modification or amendment of the assessment in any particular or a reapportionment of the entire assessment as by section 3462 of the Political Code provided, or for general relief. A direct attack is made upon the validity of the assessment in its entirety by reason of the acts, omissions, and failures of the district and its officers to comply with the statutory procedure in such cases provided and for want of jurisdiction on the grounds set forth in the written objections. Said written objections filed with the board of supervisors as prescribed by section 3462 of the Political Code, being ten in number, and which constitute the foundation of the action, assumed to state the specific grounds of objection, but not one of them questioned the validity or sufficiency of section 3455 of the Political Code, but each objection was placed on jurisdictional grounds because of alleged infirmities therein pointed out. "Jurisdiction" is a comprehensive term. A court or judicial body may lack jurisdiction to render a judgment, order, or decree, although the act under which the proceedings are prosecuted is invulnerable to attack on strictly constitutional grounds. Section 3462, supra, requires the objector to specify the grounds of objection to the assessment, and unless this be done the decision of the board of supervisors becomes final and the assessment list is conclusive evidence that said assessment has been made and levied according to law. "No objection to such assessment shall be considered by the board of supervisors, or allowed in any other action or proceeding, unless such objection shall have been made in writing to the board of supervisors as above specified." (Pol. Code, sec. 3462.) "As above specified" relates to the clause which prescribes the grounds of the objections to be stated in writing. The purpose of this provision obviously is to save the assessment from subsequent attack upon some ground which would compel a court to invalidate the entire assessment, thereby entailing a heavy loss or waste which could have been avoided had the attention of the board of supervisors been timely called to the Feb. 1927.] HERSHEY v. RECLAMATION DISTRICT No. 108. 563

error, omission or defect. Had the objection been made on the ground that section 3455, *supra*, as amended in 1917, was invalid for any reason and the objectors were relying upon such invalidity as a ground of attack that would be urged against any assessment that might be levied under it, it may be that the irrigation project would have been abandoned or postponed to such time as the question of its validity should have been determined, thereby avoiding a heavy loss which must be sustained by someone or deferred to such time as the legislature should, by re-enactment, cure such defects as are now urged against the plan of improvement by reason of the defective title of the act or any objection that might be made upon the due process clauses of the state or federal constitutions. [4] Again, it is provided by subdivision 4, section 3455, *supra*, that after the board of supervisors has approved the plans a hearing must be held by the state reclamation board to consider such objections as may be offered with respect to said plans and it shall thereafter approve, modify, amend, or reject the same. Subdivision 5 of said section further provides that when the state reclamation board shall have taken action approving, modifying, or rejecting any original, supplementary, or new plan of reclamation, after a hearing as therein provided, "such action shall be final and thereafter the sufficiency of said plans shall not be subject to attack either before the reclamation board or in any court. . . ." No appearance was made or objection filed or taken by any of the plaintiffs against the proposed plan of reclamation, including irrigation. [5] The foregoing provisions deny to the property owners no constitutional right. They are served with notice to appear and state in writing their objections, and defaulting therein they are concluded by statutes of repose. *O'Dea v. Mitchell*, 144 Cal. 374 [77 Pac. 1020], involved the failure of parties in a street assessment case to avail themselves of the remedy provided by the statute by filing written objections as to the extent or area of the district within the time required by statute, and it was held to constitute a waiver of all objections. The question of the invasion of a constitutional right was disposed of as follows:

"Appellants contend that the assessment here involved is in conflict with the fourteenth amendment to the Constitution of the United States, because lots which should have been 564 HERSHEY v. RECLAMATION DISTRICT No. 108. [200 Cal.

assessed were not included in the district, and therefore excessive and unjust burdens were placed upon the lots which were assessed—thus violating the principle of equality; but for the reasons above stated, if for no other, this contention cannot be maintained; appellants having failed to invoke the remedy provided by the statute, are now in no position to assert rights, if any they have, which could have been secured by that remedy."

[6] The right to question the constitutionality of a statute may be waived. "It is a general rule applicable in civil cases that a constitutional question must be raised at the earliest opportunity or it will be considered as waived." (12 C. J. 785.) "And where parties have failed to invoke a remedy provided by statute they are in no position thereafter to assert rights which could have been secured by that remedy, by endeavoring to invoke the aid of the Constitution." (5 Cal. Jur. 627.) One who receives a benefit from an unconstitutional law is estopped from asserting its unconstitutionality. (Vickery v. Board of Commrs., etc., 134 Ind. 554 [32 N. E. 880].) As to the necessity of pointing out specifically the grounds of protest against inclusion of lands in a drainage district or being thereafter estopped from objecting on jurisdictional grounds not set forth in the protest, see Mackay et al. v. Hancock County, 137 Iowa, 88 [114 N. W. 552].

[7] It cannot be doubted in view of the well-settled law upon the subject that the legislature has the power to create, by special acts, reclamation or irrigation districts. It could have established Reclamation District No. 108 as a separate irrigation district, notwithstanding its organization as a reclamation district, in which case the district area would have had a dual existence. That the legislature holds the power to merge or consolidate into a unified system two established systems of bringing arid and swamp and overflowed lands into a state of cultivability and productiveness there can exist no reasonable doubt. The effort of the legislature in adopting the amendment here questioned was to effect such a result.

Section 3455 of the Political Code, amended in 1917, under which amended act Reclamation District No. 108 asserts authority to exercise the powers and functions of an irrigation district, provides: Feb. 1927.] HERSHEY v. RECLAMATION DISTRICT No. 108. 565

"3455. (a) Within Sacramento and San Joaquin drainage district. If, and when any such district is located, in whole or in part, within the Sacramento and San Joaquin drainage district; (1) The board of trustees of such reclamation district must report to the board of supervisors of the county within which the district, or the greater part thereof, is situate, by filing, with the county clerk of said county, three copies of the original plan or plans of the works of reclamation and three copies of every new, supplemental, or additional plan, if any, together with the estimates of the cost of the contemplated works of the district, including incidental expenses, maintenance and repair necessary for the reclamation of the lands of the district in pursuance of any such plan or plans. The term 'works of reclamation' as used in this chapter shall include not only such public works and equipment, as are necessary for the unwatering of lands in reclamation districts, but shall also include such like works as may be necessary to water or irrigate the same lands in such districts."

The portion of the subdivision above quoted provides that "the term 'works of reclamation' as used in this chapter shall include not only such public works and equipment, as are necessary for the unwatering of lands in reclamation districts, but shall also include such like works as may be necessary to water or irrigate the same lands in such districts." (Italics supplied.)

The act consolidating and reorganizing Reclamation District No. 729 with Reclamation District No. 108 and fixing and establishing the boundaries of the consolidated district to be known as Reclamation District No. 108 went into effect in August, 1913. Its management and control was made subject to the provisions of the Political Code of the state and to other laws of the state relative to reclamation districts. (Stats. 1913, p. 62.) An act approving, confirming, and declaring valid the creation, formation, and organization of said consolidation was adopted in 1915. (Stats. 1915, p. 559.) The act amending section 3455 of the Political Code to its present form and amending a number of other sections of the Political Code "relating to swamp and overflowed, salt marsh and tide lands" by reference to the numbers of the sections amended went into effect July 17, 1917. (Stats. 1917, p. 1197.) An amendment of a code sec- 566 HERSHEY v. RECLAMATION DISTRICT No. 108. [200 Cal.

tion may be made by reference to the number of the section to be amended. (Estate of Elliott, 165 Cal. 339 [132 Pac. 439].) The same legislature passed an approval and confirmation act of the district as defined in 1915, which provided that in the control and management of the affairs of the district it is subject to the provisions of the Political Code and to all laws of the state, except as therein provided, in connection with the issuance and payment of warrants and payment of assessments and conferred jurisdiction upon the board of supervisors of Colusa County as to all matters concerning said district and provided also for the management, control, and administration of the affairs of said district. (Stats. 1917, p. 1219.) By an act approved in 1919 it was again provided that the management and control of the affairs of the district are subject to the provisions of the Political Code and to all other laws of the state, except as provided in said act, in the issuance and payment of warrants and payment of assessments; also provided for the deposit of moneys of the district with the treasurer of Colusa County and conferring jurisdiction upon the board of supervisors of the county of Colusa as to all matters concerning said district; providing for the management, control, and administration of the affairs of the district and ratifying the incorporation of certain lands in said district; authorizing the trustees to make equitable settlements with the owners of land so incorporated as to the cost of any work theretofore done before the act became effective; declaring Reclamation District No. 108 to be the successor in interest of Reclamation District No. 108 as defined and approved by the several acts of 1913, 1915, and 1917. By an act of the legislature of 1921 another section was added to the Political Code. The title of said act is expressive of the subject and follows:

"An act to add to the Political Code a new section, to be numbered three thousand four hundred sixty-seven, relating to the power of trustees of reclamation districts to make rules and regulations for furnishing water for the irrigation of lands in the district, fixing charges and rates for the same, collection of the same, levying assessments for the same on the lands in the district, providing for a special fund kept by the county treasurer in which sums collected for irrigation shall be kept, and providing for the paying out said Feb. 1927.] HERSHEY v. RECLAMATION DISTRICT No. 108. 567

fund on orders or warrants by the trustees for the costs of irrigation." (Stats. 1921, p. 1590.)

[8] From the foregoing reference to statutes it will be seen that Reclamation District No. 108 exists as a creature of special statutory enactments, and it is given broad powers thereunder in addition to the powers conferred by general laws. Large sums of money for irrigation construction were expended, beginning with July, 1917, before the act of 1919 was adopted. [9] All reclamation districts existing in the state at the time of and prior to the 1917 amendment formed under any statute of the state were subject to the provisions of the Political Code relating to reclamation districts just as though such districts had been formed by or created under the provisions of the code relating to "swamp and overflowed, salt marsh and tide lands." [10] The title of the act amending section 3455, in addition to making specific reference to the number of the code section, incorporates as a part of its title the language last above placed within quotation points. We think the title was expressive of the subject of the act if the term "reclamation" can be said to be sufficiently comprehensive to include irrigation. Certainly every land owner within District No. 108 and every person interested in reclamation in the state was, by the title of the act, put upon notice that the reclamation laws of the state were the subject of amendment by the state legislature. Owners of land within the district subject to reclamation could not have read the title of the proposed act without understanding that a change was to be made in the law. Upon reading the act the proposed change becomes manifest. And this is so whether the term "reclamation" should be deemed not ordinarily sufficiently broad as to include "irrigation." What we mean to say is that the nature, purpose, and scope of the amendment of 1917 could not have escaped the attention of the owners of reclamation lands which were to be made subject to irrigation. There is authority holding that an irrigation district possesses independent powers necessary to drain its overflowed lands and to protect its land owners from seepage and overflow waters as well as to supply water to the dry and arid lands of the district. (Pioneer Irr. Dist. v. Stone, 23 Idaho, 344 [130 Pac. 382]; Nampa etc. Irr. Dist. v. Petrie, 28 Idaho, 227 [153 Pac. 425]; United States v. Ide, 277 Fed. 373.) 568 HERSHEY v. RECLAMATION DISTRICT No. 108. [200 Cal.

[11] The conclusion reached in the above cited cases must rest upon the theory that the two methods employed to reclaim land are germane to a general purpose and in accord with the policy of the government. If the conclusion in the above cited cases be correct, there appears to be no reason why the converse of the situation is not true and that it may with equal soundness of reason be argued that the more ancient method adopted by the individual or the state for the enlargement of cultivable areas, to wit, "reclamation," is sufficiently broad and comprehensive to include the irrigation of lands which are rendered excessively dry and arid in the summer seasons by reason of the shutting out of the storm and flood waters of winter. Reclamation includes irrigation in its general, ordinary sense and, as a matter of fact, the term is quite generally applied to the reclaiming of arid lands as well as the shutting out of overflow waters. The primary purpose in each case is to regulate or control waters to the extent that lands may be brought into a state suitable for cultivation. Reclamation and irrigation of lands are cognate subjects and in many instances one would be futile and useless without the other. The same principle of law which sanctions the construction of drainage works as a necessary adjunct to an irrigation system is at least persuasive here in addition to other features of the case which have received consideration.

On July 27, 1917, said reclamation district was reorganized and the area was increased by adding 3,180 acres, making a total of 57,280 acres. The plans as prepared and adopted include an irrigation system. The estimated cost of said works was $1,231,255 and as summarized consisted of a back levee, without maintenance; irrigation, without maintenance; drainage and irrigation, and drainage laterals, without maintenance; incidental expenditures of the district; total estimated cost, without maintenance; maintenance of back levee; maintenance and operation of irrigation system. The estimated cost and expense of each item was set out. In 1919 the district was again reorganized and enlarged so as to include an additional 700 acres of land. The plans were unaffected by reorganization. On August 19, 1920, a report of the engineer covering "amended, new, supplemental and additional plans of reclamation and estimates of cost" was adopted by the trustees as the plea of the district. This Feb. 1927.] HERSHEY v. RECLAMATION DISTRICT No. 108. 569

plan provided primarily for modification of the irrigation project as included in the report of 1917. It also contained revised estimates of costs of all necessary reclamation works. The estimated costs were segregated into seven groups or branches of improvement, to wit, back levee, drainage works, irrigation works, bridges and culverts, power plants, rights of way, and incidental expenses. The estimated cost of construction, maintenance, and operation was set opposite each group. The total estimated cost was $1,951,644.87. On September 21, 1921, the board of trustees rescinded the plan adopted in 1917 and the plan adopted in 1921 and adopted an "amendatory and additional plan of reclamation" which included an enlarged irrigation project and new estimates of cost. It contains the same items of expense as the plan of 1920, but with a material increase in the estimates of cost, the total being $3,137,336.54. The report, plans, and estimates which are assailed by the plaintiffs and are known as "new, supplemental and amendatory plans" were filed March 3, 1923. Said report and plans and estimates make a comprehensive recital of all the proceedings taken by the district since its reorganization in 1917 and set forth the history of the district from a much earlier date.

The summary of the totals as computed and estimated by the trustees and officers in the estimates of 1923 is as follows: For construction, $2,338,490.75; maintenance, $438,929.43; drainage operation, $185,802.98; irrigation operation, $100,583.66; incidentals, $343,993.87; total, $3,407,800.69.

Necessarily the subjects dealt with had to be grouped or classified to some extent, keeping in mind a substantial compliance with the statute, if the reports, plans, and estimates were to be held within reasonable limits. It could not be expected that each item considered in forming the estimates would be set out in minute detail.

[12] Plaintiffs complain bitterly of the lack of itemization of certain interest bearing periods with respect to dates and the rate of interest charged. In this respect it is contended that if interest on past expenses is claimed the basis for the charge should be stated in the plans and estimates; if future interest on past expense is a legitimate charge, then the amount and rate of interest should be stated in the plans and estimates so that the land owner may know whether 570 HERSHEY v. RECLAMATION DISTRICT No. 108. [200 Cal.

the charge is fair. The amount of the future interest on past expense is not stated and if interest on past expense is a permissible item there is no way of segregating it from unstated future interest. In short, it is claimed that the plans and estimates are poorly prepared and leave the question of interest in a state of utter confusion. On the question of charges of interest, as well as all other charges or expenses or things or matters about which appellants were entitled to be informed, the officers of the district were called as witnesses and examined thereon. The questions whether or not the items upon which interest was computed are set out in commendable detail and whether or not specific sums of interest were included as items of charges could have been gone into fully at the hearing had before the board of supervisors and again at the trial. As a matter of fact the commissioners, who are engineers, were examined as to the interest expenditures and charges and it was not made to appear to the trial court that a want of segregation or itemization in the particulars raised by the objections was inexplicable to a fatal degree, or was a mystifying method employed by the officers of the district to perpetrate wrongs upon certain of the land owners of the district. The officers gave their theory as to what they believed to be the fairest plan of arriving at estimates, which were, after all, except in cases where interest has accrued, or where the situation presents some fixed basis of computation, but an approximation.

It may be presumed in the absence of evidence to the contrary that the officers did their duty and computed interest on a basis not exceeding its legal rate. But this was a matter easily ascertainable. The trial court having heard the evidence addressed to the issues before it and having made its finding thereon, we are not permitted to interfere with its judgment unless as a matter of law it appears to be erroneous. This does not so appear. We have also given consideration to other objections made on the ground that there was not a proper segregation of expenditures on account of cost of construction and maintenance and other matters of expense. It was the purpose and effort of the commissioners to classify under general headings cost, maintenance, and operation expenses. As a rule they were not segregated or itemized in the manner pointed out by plaintiffs. But as Feb. 1927.] HERSHEY v. RECLAMATION DISTRICT No. 108. 571

we observed above, the trial court found no sufficient reason because of such failure to invalidate the assessment. The plans and estimates are complicated and brought into the calculations a large number of problems difficult of solution. Many of the problems which confronted the commissioners were not capable of exact results even by the application of the rules of the most exact of sciences, mathematics. We think the work of the commissioners, however, is the result of at least a reasonable, fair, and intelligent consideration of a difficult problem. The question of benefits conferred was passed upon and fixed by the commissioners and finally by the trial court. The contention that the main canal is about nine miles from the nearest point of plaintiffs' lands is not determinative of the question of benefits. The land is within the district and it has a right to the use of the waters which are brought into the district from the Sacramento River. The benefits that are thereby derived, as compared to other lands within the district, were questions of fact to be determined by the district in the first instance and by the trial court finally. As an abstract proposition lands located more distantly from a watercourse may be benefited in a greater degree than lands which are adjacent to the stream. So with respect to lands of high elevation compared with low lands. The Wilkins Slough pumping plant constructed at a considerable cost and rendered useless by reason of the fall of the water-level to a point below the intake of the canal was a contingency, it would seem, that could not ordinarily be foreseen. Large quantities of water taken from the river for irrigation purposes and excessive dry seasons were responsible for its failure. The Knight's Landing, Howell Point, Rough and Ready, and Steiner Bend pumping and drainage losses were questions submitted to the court upon the theory of their invalidating effect as to plaintiffs' entire assessment. The sound judgment of the court, even though we may question certain of the expenditures and transactions, cannot, under the rule of decision, be disturbed. A comprehensive plan or scheme of reclamation involving many problems, such as we have before us, must fail or disappoint in some respects and in the absence of proof of bad faith upon the part of its officers, courts will not exact such a rigid stewardship of those charged with a public duty as to com- 572 VAUGHAN v. CALDWELL. [200 Cal.

pletely ignore the complexities and uncertainties that attend the problem.

We are, of the opinion, in view of the procedure taken by the district and the legislative treatment of the subject matter, that the supplemental plans and estimates which succeeded the 1917 reorganizing act and the subsequent acts heretofore mentioned give warrant for including the costs and expenses incurred after the passage of the 1917 act and prior to the adoption of the 1923 plans and estimates.

The rulings of the court on the admissibility of evidence in the two instances complained of are not sufficient to justify a reversal in view of the record contents.

Judgment affirmed.

John G. Covert and Frank Lamberson for Appellant.

J. L. C. Irwin for Respondent.

LANGDON, J.—Plaintiff brought this action as a member of a partnership against the other two members of such partnership. It was alleged that the partnership was formed in February, 1918, for the purpose of doing general highway and street construction work and that it continued to transact business as such partnership until March 1, 1921; that the parties to said partnership were to share the losses and divide the profits of the business equally between them; that it was mutually agreed that defendant Caldwell should devote all his time and attention to the partnership business, and that the plaintiff and the defendant Applegarth were to devote all the time and attention that was necessary to the transaction of said partnership business and that the plaintiff and each of the defendants were to receive a specified monthly salary for such time as was devoted by each of said partners to the partnership business; that the plaintiff gave his entire time and attention to said partnership business from on or about May 1, 1918, to March 1, 1921, and that 574 VAUGHAN v. CALDWELL. [200 Cal.

plaintiff received no salary for said services, although each of the defendants were paid the full amount due them for their services rendered said partnership; that plaintiff has paid out and expended for and on account of said partnership business large sums of money, to wit, $35,372, in excess of the money paid and expended by defendants, and that said defendants promised and agreed to repay two-thirds of said sum of $35,372, to wit, the sum of $23,581.33 on demand, together with interest thereon at the rate of eight per cent per annum until paid, and that no part of said sum has ever been paid.

There are further allegations to the effect that defendant Caldwell violated the terms of the partnership agreement by failing to devote all his time and attention to said partnership business and by securing contracts for work in his own name, and specific instances of such failure are set forth.

The prayer was that an account be taken of all the partnership dealings and transactions from the time of the commencement thereof to the date of the action; that the property of said partnership be sold and the partnership debts and liabilities be paid and any surplus divided among the plaintiff and the defendants according to their respective interests and that plaintiff have judgment against defendants for the sum of $23,581.33, together with interest thereon at the rate of eight per cent per annum until paid, and for the sum of $4,450 salary, and for general relief.

Defendant Applegarth failed to answer and his default was entered. Defendant Caldwell answered, admitting the formation of a partnership, but denying that this partnership continued as such later than about February 20, 1921. The answer also alleged that the partnership was wholly and completely dissolved by mutual consent and agreement of plaintiff and defendants on or about February 19, 1921. Denial is made of plaintiff's allegations that he had devoted his entire time to the partnership business between the dates named and of other matters in the complaint relating to advancement of moneys by plaintiff. It is alleged that at the time of the alleged dissolution of said partnership, all the property of said partnership was delivered by defendants to plaintiff in complete settlement, satisfaction, discharge, and adjustment of all the business and accounts of said partnership and said property was so received by plain- Feb. 1927.] VAUGHAN v. CALDWELL. 575

tiff; that the partnership has no further property or assets, but that all its property and assets remained in the possession of plaintiff from the time of the dissolution of the partnership until it was disposed of by said plaintiff for his own use and benefit.

When the case came on for trial, the plaintiff asked for the appointment of a referee to take an accounting, which application was opposed by defendant and appellant upon the ground that a complete dissolution, accounting, and settlement had been had on or about February 20, 1921. Testimony was offered on behalf of the parties upon this issue and the trial court held that no accounting had been had and that an accounting was necessary. A referee was appointed to try the issues in the accounting of the business operations and to report his findings to the court. After taking testimony for weeks, and examining books and accounts, the referee reported his findings to the court. The evidence before the referee upon which his findings are based is not before this court in the transcript of appeal. All presumptions, therefore, are in favor of the findings. The defendant excepted to the findings of the referee and the court proceeded to take testimony upon the disputed items. Thereafter, the trial court modified one paragraph of the findings of the referee so as to include an obligation upon the part of defendants to pay interest to plaintiff at the rate of eight per cent per annum on all sums of money advanced by plaintiff to said partnership from the date of advancement, which interest was estimated in the findings at $17,787.13.

[1] It is first contended by the appellant that the complaint does not state a cause of action for an accounting and that the demurrer thereto should have been sustained. We think this objection is without merit. The particular attack made upon the complaint is that it does not allege a dissolution of the partnership. There were allegations of violations of the partnership agreement by defendant Caldwell and such an allegation was held, in Bremner v. Leviatt, 109 Cal. 130 [41 Pac. 859], to justify an accounting and dissolution. In this case it was said:

"It was, therefore, proper for plaintiff to allege the violation by defendants of their obligation in this regard as one of the grounds of his action, and upon which he desired an 576 VAUGHAN v. CALDWELL. [200 Cal.
accounting; and the fact that the breach of this obligation by the defendants resulted in damage to the plaintiff does not constitute it a separate cause of action at law for damages, as contended by respondents. Such damages are but an incident of the general cause of action assigned. Partners cannot sue one another at law for any breach of the duties or obligations arising from that relation. This can only be done in chancery by asking a dissolution and accounting, and, if damages accrue from any cause in such proceeding, they must be adjusted by some appropriate method in that tribunal." In the case of *Brandt v. Salomonson*, 17 Cal. App. 395 [119 Pac. 946], the action was brought for a dissolution and an accounting.

[2] Appellant objects to the finding of the court that the plaintiff gave his entire time and attention to the partnership business from about May 1, 1918, to March 1, 1921, and has received no salary from said partnership for such services except the sum of $1,200, and that there is now due plaintiff the sum of $4,725, and that each of said defendants is indebted to plaintiff for one-third thereof. It was found—and this finding is not attacked—that the said plaintiff and each of the defendants were to receive a salary of $150 per month for such time as was devoted by each of said copartners to said copartnership business, and that thereafter, on or about the fifteenth day of November, 1918, it was mutually agreed between the said partners, that each of said copartners should receive for his services the sum of $200 per month thereafter, from said copartnership business.

There is ample testimony in the record to sustain the finding of the referee and of the court that plaintiff was entitled to salary between the dates named. It is true that there was a period of several months when the partnership was not actively engaged in construction work because it had completed all its contracts. During that period plaintiff and defendant Caldwell traveled around attempting to secure new contracts and while the work at that time was perhaps not as regular and constant as at other periods, nevertheless, Caldwell drew his full salary for that period and it does not appear that plaintiff neglected any work which there was for him to do in connection with said business. There appears no reason, therefore, why he should not be remuner- Feb. 1927.] VAUGHAN v. CALDWELL. 577

ated upon the same basis as the other two partners during the interim when the partnership was searching for new work.

[3] It is objected that there is no evidence to sustain the finding that the defendants agreed to repay to plaintiff two-thirds of his advances for the partnership business. It is admitted by the answer that the plaintiff and defendants were to share the losses and divide the profits of the partnership equally between them. Therefore, it follows as a matter of course, that since they were to share the losses and divide the profits equally, if the plaintiff advanced more money than the defendants, there was an implied contract that the defendants would repay their proportion of the money advanced. Furthermore, the finding under consideration is sustained by the testimony of defendant Applegarth that the plaintiff and defendants entered into a partnership to build roads, streets, etc., and that they were to "split" the profits or losses three ways, one-third each.

[4] It is contended that the evidence is insufficient to support the finding of the court that the defendants agreed to pay interest to the plaintiff upon moneys advanced by him. There is considerable testimony in the record on this question. It is not all direct and conclusive testimony, but taken together, we think it amply supports the finding. Plaintiff testified about the meeting between the partners when the terms and conditions of the partnership were discussed and he stated that the defendants had promised to pay him eight per cent on the money he advanced. There was other testimony by this same witness and also by the defendant Applegarth to the effect that plaintiff stated he would have to borrow money at eight per cent interest and would have to receive that much upon it and that this was acquiesced in by the defendants.

Appellant contends that interest upon the advances made by plaintiff should have ceased on February 20, 1921, when the partnership ceased to do any business. Authorities are cited to the effect that where there is an agreement to pay interest upon capital contributed by one of the partners, such interest ceases with the dissolution of the firm. There are two sufficient answers to the contention made. First, the trial court adopted the finding of the referee that "it is not true that said copartnership was by mutual consent and

200 Cal.—37 578 VAUGHAN v. CALDWELL. [200 Cal.
agreement of the plaintiff and the defendants, on or about the 20th day of February, 1921, at the City of Coalinga, County of Fresno, State of California, wholly and completely or at all dissolved." It was also found that the plaintiff was entitled to a dissolution of the partnership as of the date of the findings. It would appear, therefore, that by applying the rule relied upon by appellant, interest should be allowed to date of the findings and judgment, the date of the dissolution of the partnership.

[5] The second answer to appellant's contention is that the reasoning of the authorities upon which he relies and which allow no interest upon advances after dissolution is based upon the theory that the agreement between the parties was to pay interest during the time when the advances were earning money in the business. This reasoning can have no place where there is an express agreement of the parties to pay interest to a different date, and in the instant case it was found by the trial court that the defendants promised and agreed to repay to plaintiff two-thirds of the advances which he made for the business "together with interest on all sums of money advanced from the date of advancement at the rate of eight per cent per annum until paid." In the face of this express agreement, no general rules governing implied agreements have any application.

The other findings of the trial court respecting the property and assets of the partnership find support in the record, and it is unnecessary to set forth herein the evidence appearing in the transcript.

The judgment is affirmed.

ALASKA PACKERS ASSOCIATION (a Corporation), Petitioner, v. INDUSTRIAL ACCIDENT COMMISSION, etc., and JOHN PETERSON, Respondents.

[1] WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION ACT—EMPLOYER AND EMPLOYEE—CONTRACT OF EMPLOYMENT—JURISDICTION.—Where a contract of employment is made in the state of California, the employer and the employee are subject to the provisions of the Workmen's Compensation Law of this state, although the injuries complained of occurred outside the state.

[2] Id.—NATURE OF CONTRACT.—A contract employing one as a member of the crew of a bark bound for Alaska, where the employee engaged in catching fish for a cannery, is maritime in its nature.

[3] Id.—CHARACTER OF WORK—EFFECT ON CONTRACT.—In such a case, the fact that the employee worked at mending nets, performed services in loading and unloading lighters carrying the cargo of the ship, and, part of the time while the vessel was in Alaska, slept on shore, did not qualify in any way the nature of his contract, or render it severable.

[4] Id.—MARITIME CONTRACTS—MARITIME LAW—STATE REGULATIONS. Generally speaking, parties entering into maritime contracts contemplate the system of maritime law and its well-known rules control their rights and liabilities, to the exclusion of state statutes; but, as to certain local matters, regulation of which works no material prejudice to the general maritime law, nor interferes with the proper harmony or uniformity of that law in its international or interstate relations, the rules of the maritime law may be modified or supplemented by state regulation.

[5] Id.—COMPENSATION ACT—STATUTORY CONSTRUCTION.—When a compensation act supersedes other state laws touching a liability for damages which depended upon the common law and state statutes, it does not come into conflict with any superior maritime law; and this is true whether the award under the act is made as upon an implied agreement or otherwise.

[6] Id.—COMPENSATION FOR INJURIES—ABROGATION OF COMMON LAW.—The California Workmen's Compensation Act provides the only means by which an injured employee can recover compensation from his employer for injuries received in the course of and

arising out of his employment, and it abrogates common-law liability of the master for such injuries in the cases to which it is applicable.

[7] Id.—MARITIME CONTRACTS—INJURY OF EMPLOYEE ON LAND—LOCAL LAW.—Although a person was employed by a contract made here to go as a seaman to Alaska waters for the purpose of catching fish for a cannery, a claim made by him for injuries received while standing on the beach, pushing and lifting on a fishing boat in an endeavor to launch it, comes within the compensation law of this state.

[8] Id.—EMPLOYEES—SEAMEN.—While seamen and fishermen may not usually be referred to as "employees," there can be no question but that they come within the broad meaning of this word as used in section 8 of the Workmen's Compensation Act.

Chickering & Gregory and Blair S. Shuman for Petitioner.

G. C. Faulkner for Respondent Industrial Accident Commission.

H. W. Hutton for Respondent Peterson.

WASTE, C. J.—Alaska Packers Association petitions this court to review and annul an award of the respondent Industrial Accident Commission made against it, as self-insurer, and in favor of respondent John Peterson, who was injured while in Alaska. Peterson entered the employ of the petitioner under contract, shipping from San Francisco as a seaman and fisherman. During the voyage to Alaska, he acted as a member of the crew of the bark "Star

7. See 27 Cal. Jur. 320. Feb. 1927.] ALASKA PACKERS ASSN. v. INDUS. ACC. COM. 581

of Iceland," performing the regular duties of a seaman. On arrival in Alaska, he was taken with the rest of the crew to one of petitioner's canneries, and put to work repairing nets and overhauling the fishing boats on the dock, where they had been stored for the winter. When that work was completed, Peterson and another employee were assigned to one of the fishing boats, which they operated for a period of about five weeks. The fishing season at the cannery closed, and the men were directed to bring their boats to the dock, to be hoisted up by a winch and placed in the warehouse for the following winter. Peterson anchored his boat near the beach, with the intention of later taking it to the dock. When he returned for that purpose, the boat, because of low tide, was stranded on the sand and mud of the beach, all but a few feet near the stern, however, being in the water. Standing on the beach, Peterson attempted, with the assistance of others, to lift the boat to float it, and in so doing strained his back and left hip, causing a fracture of the vertebrae. He returned to San Francisco on the "Star of Iceland" as a seaman, and, on arrival, received his discharge.

[1] As the contract of employment was made in the state of California, the employer and employee were subject to the provisions of the Workmen's Compensation Law [Stats. 1917, p. 831]. Peterson, therefore, filed an application with the Industrial Accident Commission for an adjustment of claim for compensation for the injury suffered. The Commission found that the applicant sustained injury occurring in the course of and arising out of his employment, and made an award in his favor and against the employer, as self-insurer. Application for a rehearing before the Commission was denied, and the employer now petitions this court to review and to set aside the award. Its main contention is that the Commission was without jurisdiction over this cause for the reason that the contract of hire was wholly maritime in character, and, therefore, under the exclusive admiralty jurisdiction of the courts of the United States.

[2] Peterson's contract with the petitioner was undoubtedly maritime in its nature. (Domenico v. Alaska Packers Assn., 112 Fed. 554, 556; North Alaska Salmon Co. v. Larsen, 220 Fed. 93, 95; Heino v. Libby, McNeill & Libby, 116 Wash. 148, 157 [205 Pac. 854].) [3] We do not regard the 582 ALASKA PACKERS ASSN. v. INDUS. ACC. COM. [200 Cal.

fact that the employee worked at mending nets, performed services in loading and unloading lighters carrying the cargo to the ship, and, part of the time while the vessel was in Alaska, slept on shore, as qualifying in any way the nature of his contract, or rendering it severable. [4] Generally speaking, parties entering into maritime contracts contemplate the system of maritime law, and its well-known rules control their rights and liabilities, to the exclusion of state statutes. (Union Fish Co. v. Erickson, 248 U. S. 308 [63 L. Ed. 261, 39 Sup. Ct. Rep. 112, see, also, Rose's U. S. Notes].) But, as to certain local matters, regulation of which will work no material prejudice to the general maritime law, or interfere with the proper harmony or uniformity of that law in its international or interstate relations, the rules of the maritime law may be modified or supplemented by state regulation. (Western Fuel Co. v. Garcia, 257 U. S. 233, 242 [66 L. Ed. 210, 42 Sup. Ct. Rep. 89]; Grant, Smith-Porter Ship Co. v. Rohde, 257 U. S. 469, 477 [25 A. L. R. 1008, 66 L. Ed. 321, 42 Sup. Ct. Rep. 157]; State Industrial Com., etc., v. Nordenholt Corp., 259 U. S. 263, 274, 275 [25 A. L. R. 1013, 66 L. Ed. 933, 42 Sup. Ct. Rep. 473].) [5] When a compensation act supersedes other state laws touching a liability for damages which depended upon the common law and state statutes, it does not come into conflict with any superior maritime law. And this is true whether the award under the act is made as upon an implied agreement or otherwise. (State Industrial Com., etc., v. Nordenholt Corp., supra, pp. 275, 276.) In that case a stevedore, engaged in unloading a vessel lying in navigable waters, slipped and fell on the dock. He was awarded compensation under the Workmen's Compensation Law of New York, and the United States supreme court held that application of the local law would not work material prejudice to any characteristic feature of the general maritime law. In Grant, Smith-Porter Ship Co. v. Rhode, supra, the court held that, while the general admiralty jurisdiction extends to a proceeding to recover damages resulting from a tort committed on a vessel in process of construction when lying in navigable waters, under the "circumstances stated the exclusive features of the Oregon Workmen's Compensation Act . . . would apply and abrogate the right to recover damages in an admiralty court which otherwise would ex- Feb. 1927.] ALASKA PACKERS ASSN. v. INDUS. ACC. COM. 583

ist." In a still more recent case, in which the record disclosed facts said by the court to be sufficient to show a maritime tort, to which the general admiralty jurisdiction would extend, the court sustained an award made under the Texas State Compensation Act, saying: "The matter is of mere local concern and its regulation by the state will work no material prejudice to any characteristic feature of the general maritime law." (Miller's Indemnity Underwriters v. Braud, 270 U. S. 59 [70 L. Ed. 470, 46 Sup. Ct. Rep. 194].) To the same effect is the decision of this court in City of Oakland v. Industrial Acc. Com., 198 Cal. 273 [244 Pac. 353]. [6] The California Workmen's Compensation Act provides the only means by which an injured employee can recover compensation from his employer for injuries received in the course of and arising out of his employment, and it abrogates the common-law liability of the master for such injuries in the cases to which it is applicable. (Netherlands American Steam Nav. Co. v. Gallagher, 282 Fed. 171, 183.) The obvious intent of the act was to substitute its procedure for the former method of settling disputes arising between those occupying the strict relationship of master and servant, or employer and employee, by means of actions for damages. (Cooper v. Industrial Acc. Com., 177 Cal. 685, 687 [171 Pac. 684].) It substitutes a new system of rights and obligations for the common-law rules governing the liability of employers for injuries to their employees. (Western Indemnity Co. v. Pillsbury, 170 Cal. 686, 692 [151 Pac. 398].) When the specified conditions exist, the remedy provided by the act is exclusive of all other statutory or common-law remedies. (DeCarli v. Associated Oil Co., 57 Cal. App. 310 [207 Pac. 282].)

[7] Peterson was injured while standing on the beach, pushing and lifting on a fishing boat in an endeavor to launch it. The work he was performing at the time of his injury had no more direct relation to navigation or commerce or to his duties either as a seaman or as a fisherman than would the work of a longshoreman loading or unloading a ship. It was essentially "land labor," nonmaritime in its nature. These circumstances serve to bring the case within the category of those relating to dock and port employees working under maritime contracts, but who sustain injuries 584 ALASKA PACKERS ASSN. v. INDUS. ACC. COM. [200 Cal.

on land. In such a case the local law may apply. "When an employee, working on board a vessel in navigable waters [italics ours], sustains injuries there, and seeks damages from the employer, the applicable legal principles are very different from those which would control it if he had been injured on land while unloading the vessel. In the former situation the liability of the employer must be determined under the maritime law; in the latter, no general maritime rule prescribes the liability, and the local law has always been applied. The liability of the employer for damages on account of injuries received on shipboard by an employee under a maritime contract is matter within the admiralty jurisdiction; but not so when the accident occurs on land." (State Industrial Com. v. Nordenholt, supra; Netherlands American Steam Nav. Co. v. Gallagher, supra.) The action here is not one to recover on a contract, maritime or otherwise. The liability of the employer to pay compensation to the injured employee arises from the Workmen's Compensation Act, to which Peterson and the petitioner were subject, rather than from any agreement of the parties. The law operates on the status of the parties, and affixes certain rights and obligations to that status. (North Alaska Salmon Co. v. Pillsbury, 174 Cal. 1, 2 [L. R. A. 1917E, 642, 162 Pac. 93].) Under the circumstances here shown to exist, application of the California Workmen's Compensation Act will not work any material prejudice to any characteristic feature of the general maritime law. (Grant, Smith-Porter Ship Co. v. Rohde, supra; State Industrial Com., etc., v. Nordenholt Corp., supra; City of Oakland v. Industrial Acc. Com., supra.)

[8] Petitioner makes some objection to the references to Peterson as an "employee," and states: "We know of no cases involving seamen where they are termed employees." "Employee" is defined in Bouvier's Law Dictionary as "a term of rather broad significance for one who is employed . . ."; and "employed" is "the act of doing a thing and the being under contract or orders to do it." (United States v. Morris, 39 U. S. (14 Pet.) 463, 475 [10 L. Ed. 543, see, also, Rose's U. S. Notes].) While seamen and fishermen may not usually be referred to as "employees," there can be no question but that they come within the broad mean- March, 1927.]

[1] CONTRACTS—BROKERS' COMMISSIONS—TIME OF PAYMENT.—Where a written agreement provided for the payment of a certain sum for the procuring of a loan on real property "when said transaction is consummated on or before" a specified date, the promisors testifying that the purpose of the quoted provision was to negative any liability on their part in the event they should not consummate the purchase of property upon which the loan was to be a lien, and the promisee testifying that there was no such understanding but that its purpose was merely to delay payment of his fee until consummation of the sale and not to make payment contingent upon that event, the consummation of the sale was not a condition precedent to recovery of the commission, but the commission was earned when a loan was secured and the money deposited within the required time, regardless of whether or not the sale was ever consummated.

[2] USURY LAW—CONSTRUCTION—INTENT—CONSTITUTIONAL LAW.—The "Usury Law" (Stats. 1919, p. lxxxiii) was not intended to limit the charge for "examinations, views, fees, appraisals, commissions . . ." etc., made by the lender himself, but, on the contrary, the lender is to be denied all compensation or emoluments of every kind which will enlarge his return or profit on the loan beyond the maximum amount allowed by the act; and the provision with reference to charges "for examinations, views, fees, appraisals, commissions, renewals, etc.," was intended to regulate such charges when made by a third person or persons as part of the expense in connection with the loan.

[3] Id.—TITLE OF ACT—CONSTITUTIONAL LAW.—The subject matter covered by the title to the "Usury Law" is exclusively "usury," and the subject in said act with reference to charges and expenses of loan brokers, not being in the title, the act is unconstitutional, as far as that subject is concerned.

[4] Id.—INITIATIVE MEASURE—TITLE OF ACT—CONSTITUTION.—The provision of section 24 of article IV of the constitution, requiring every act to embrace but one subject, which subject shall be expressed in its title, is applicable to a statute passed by the initiative method.

[5] Id.—CHARACTER OF INITIATIVE MEASURE—APPLICATION OF CONSTITUTION.—The contention that an initiative measure in its effect is a constitutional amendment and that as constitutional amendments need not conform to the provision of the constitution requiring every subject contained in the act to be expressed in its title, an initiative measure need not conform to this provision of the constitution, cannot be maintained.

[6] Id.—ILLEGAL DISCRIMINATION—CONSTITUTIONAL LAW.—The "Usury Law" (Stats. 1919, p. lxxxiii), contains an unlawful discrimination between charges of brokers negotiating unsecured loans and the same character of charges in negotiating secured loans, also with reference to loans where the period of the loan is less than six months; and such provisions violate sections 11 and 21 of article I of the constitution of California, and the fourteenth amendment to the constitution of the United States and are void.

It was agreed that this clause was added at the request of defendants when the paper was presented to them for their signatures.

Defendants testified its purpose was to negative any liability on their part in the event they should not consummate purchase of the property upon which the loan was to be a lien. Plaintiff testified that there was no such understanding, but that its purpose was merely to delay payment of his fee until consummation of the sale and not to 588 WALLACE v. ZINMAN. [200 Cal.

make payment contingent upon that event. The sale was not consummated.

In this conflict the trial court accepted plaintiff's testimony, relying upon the authority of *Purcell v. Firth*, 175 Cal. 746 [167 Pac. 379]. In that case it was held that an agreement to pay a commission on a sale "when the sale is consummated" did not make consummation of the sale a condition precedent to recovery of the commission, but that the commission was earned when a purchaser able and willing to buy was produced, regardless of whether or not the sale was ever consummated. We hold that the facts in the present case bring it within the rule announced in *Purcell v. Firth*, supra.

Appellants, however, unyielding, have sought refuge in the initiative measure, commonly known as the "Usury Law," approved at the general election November 5, 1918 (Stats. 1919, p. lxxxiii), the provision thereof relied upon being as follows:

" . . . Any person, company, association or corporation who shall . . . ask, demand, receive, take, accept or charge more than an amount equal to 5% so actually loaned and secured in all sums of $1000 or less, and 3% on all sums over $1000 in full for all examinations, views, fees, appraisals, commissions, renewals made within one year from the date of loan and charges of any kind or description whatsoever, except abstracts or certificates of title charges made under the Torrens Land Law or otherwise in the procuring, making and transacting of the business connected with such loans, . . . shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof shall be punished, . . . "

It must be admitted that the provision, if valid, was directly violated by the respondent's commission contract in that it exceeded the maximum commission allowed on a loan of that character, and in such case the contract would be unenforceable and void. (See *Berka v. Woodward*, 125 Cal. 119, 127 [73 Am. St. Rep. 31, 45 L. R. A. 420, 57 Pac. 777]; *Levinson v. Boas*, 150 Cal. 185, 193 [11 Ann. Cas. 661, 12 L. R. A. (N. S.) 575, 88 Pac. 825]; *Smith v. Bach*, 183 Cal. 259, 262 [191 Pac. 14]; *Firpo v. Murphy*, 72 Cal. App. 249 [236 Pac. 968].) March, 1927.] WALLACE v. ZINMAN. 589

And likewise in such case it would not be necessary to present such defense by answer or other pleading, but when the illegality of plaintiff's contract appeared, it would be the duty of the court sua sponte to deny all relief. (Pacific Wharf etc. Co. v. Dredging Co., 184 Cal. 21 [192 Pac. 847]; Morey v. Paladini, 187 Cal. 727 [203 Pac. 760]; Wise v. Radis, 74 Cal. App. 765 [242 Pac. 90].)

But respondent meets this claim of illegality by the counter-contention that the said provision of the so-called Usury Law is unconstitutional and void in this: That it is in direct violation of section 24 of article IV of the constitution, which provides: "Every act shall embrace but one subject, which subject shall be expressed in its title. But if any such subject shall be embraced in an act and shall not be expressed in its title, such act shall be void only as to so much thereof as shall not be expressed in its title. . . ."

Also that it violates section 11 of article I, which provides: "All laws of a general nature shall have a uniform operation."

Likewise section 21 of article I, which provides: ". . . Nor shall any citizen or class of citizens, be granted privileges or immunities which, on the same terms, shall not be granted to all citizens."

And likewise is a violation of the fourteenth amendment to the constitution of the United States in that it denies to certain citizens the equal protection of the law.

We shall now discuss these various contentions. The title of the act is as follows: "An act, to be known as the usury law, relating to the rate of interest which may be charged for the loan or forbearance of money, goods or things in action, or on accounts after demand, or on judgments, providing penalties for the violation of the provisions hereof, and repealing sections one thousand nine hundred seventeen, one thousand nine hundred eighteen, one thousand nine hundred nineteen, and one thousand nine hundred twenty of the Civil Code and all acts and parts of acts in conflict with this act."

[2] We are convinced that the intent of the act is not to limit the charge for "examinations, views, fees, appraisals, commissions . . ."; made by the lender himself, but, on the contrary, the lender is to be denied all 590 WALLACE v. ZINMAN. [200 Cal.

compensation or emoluments of every kind which will enlarge his return or profit on the loan beyond the maximum amount allowed by the act. The provision is intended to regulate the charges as to examinations, views, fees, appraisals, and commissions when made by a third person or persons as part of the expense in connection with a loan. In practically every loan there will be legal expenses for some one or more of the above-enumerated items and, if reasonable, they, of course, will be allowed without tainting the transaction as usurious. But the plain intent of the act is to forbid to the lender any sum or sums whatsoever which might reach his pocket and thereby exceed the interest rate allowed by the act. In other words, it was intended by this act to deal solely with this class of charges when made by persons acting independent of the lender. In short, it is a provision to curtail the charges and expenses of loan brokers. This intent is made clearer by an examination of section 1691 of the Wisconsin Statutes of 1917, from which doubtless the draftsman of this provision gained his inspiration.

The Wisconsin section contains language dealing exclusively with personal property loan brokers, which language is identical in many respects with the language employed in the act under consideration except that the draftsman of the act here before us omitted the very language necessary to make the provision applicable to the lender himself.

In other words, the Wisconsin law provided: "Any person who . . . shall ask . . . in addition to the interest aforesaid . . . shall be guilty . . . " The omission of this language clearly evinces the intention to exclude the lender from any benefits whatsoever in connection with the loan, save and alone the maximum rate of interest allowed. *Ornstine v. Cary*, 126 Wis. 135 [11 L. R. A. (N. S.) 174, 105 N. W. 792], cited by counsel, upholds the validity of the Wisconsin act as it there reads, but, as we have noted, our statute does not adhere to the language of the Wisconsin act.

[3] When thus interpreted it is too clear for controversy that the subject matter of the provision of the act here under consideration is nowhere referred to directly or indirectly in the title to said statute. The subject covered by the title is exclusively "usury." The subject March, 1927.]

WALLACE v. ZINMAN.

covered by the provision under consideration is charges and expenses of loan brokers. It will be noted that the regulation of the business of real estate brokers, which also covers loan brokerage contracts where real estate is given as security, is controlled by an act approved June 1, 1917, and amended May 27, 1919, and May 23, 1925 (Deering's Gen. Laws 1923, part I, p. 25, Stats. 1925, p. 600), which act has been declared constitutional and valid. (Riley v. Chambers, 181 Cal. 589 [8 A. L. R. 418, 185 Pac. 855].) In short, the subject referred to in this provision is so widely separated in meaning from the provision referred to in the title of this act that it has already become the subject of existing independent legislation.

[4] It may, however, be contended that inasmuch as this is a statute which was adopted by the initiative method provided for in section 1 of article IV of the constitution, said article IV, section 24, of the constitution, relating to title of statutes, is for that reason inapplicable thereto. We cannot, however, concede the efficacy of any such contention. Section 22 of article I of the constitution reads: "The provisions of this Constitution are mandatory and prohibitory unless by express words they are declared to be otherwise."

The purpose of this provision was before this court in Ex parte Liddell, 93 Cal. 633, 636 [29 Pac. 251]. In that case, after giving a brief outline of the history of this character of legislation, the court said: "At the present time, however, the constitutions of many states contain provisions similar to that quoted above. The object of the provision is to prevent legislative abuse—to prevent the passage of acts bearing deceitful and misleading titles. It is intended to protect the members of the legislature, as well as the public, against fraud; to guard against the passage of bills the titles of which give no intimation to the members of the legislature or to the people of the matters contained therein. (Cooley's Constitutional Limitations, 6th ed., 169.)"

The holding of this court as thus stated has not been departed from to any extent. (Estate of Elliott, 165 Cal. 339, 344 [132 Pac. 439]; see, also, People v. Y. Wong, 61 Cal. App. 497, 503 [215 Pac. 409]; Watson v. Greely, 67 Cal. App. 328, 342 [227 Pac. 664].) There can be no 592 WALLACE v. ZINMAN. [200 Cal.

just reason assigned for holding that this provision is mandatory when applied to statutes passed regularly by the legislature and at the same time inapplicable to statutes initiated by petition and passed by direct vote of the people. Every reason going to protect the public from imposition by undesignated matter in the title of an act of the legislature obtains with like if not greater force to a measure that is to be voted upon by the people. It is common knowledge that an initiative measure is originated by some organization or a small group of people and they circulate a petition requiring the signature of only eight per cent of the voters; that the measure is then placed upon the ballot and a large number of the population, not knowing what the context of the act is, rely solely upon its title as a guide to intelligent voting thereon. Speaking of the identical question before us, the supreme court of Oregon, in State v. Richardson, 48 Or. 309, 319 [8 L. R. A. (N. S.) 362, 85 Pac. 225, 229], said:

"The validity of laws adopted at the polls must be determined like enactments by the legislative assembly, by the test of the Constitution as modified by the amendment thereto. Though the argument that a proposed measure must depend upon its own merits may not apply to acts initiated by petitions, a valid reason for requiring that the subject matter of laws to be adopted or rejected at the polls should be stated in the title nevertheless exists. The majority of qualified electors are so much interested in managing their own affairs that they have no time carefully to consider measures affecting the general public. A great number of voters undoubtedly have a superficial knowledge of proposed laws to be voted upon, which is derived from newspaper comments or from conversation with their associates. We think the assertion may safely be ventured that it is only the few persons who earnestly favor or zealously oppose the passage of a proposed law, initiated by petition, who have attentively studied its contents and know how it will probably affect their private interests. The greater number of voters do not possess this information and usually derive their knowledge of the contents of a proposed law from an inspection of the title thereof, which is sometimes secured only from the very meager details afforded by a ballot which is examined in an elec- March, 1927.] WALLACE v. ZINMAN. 593

tion booth preparatory to exercising the right of suffrage. It is important, therefore, that the title to laws proposed in the manner indicated should strictly comply with the constitutional requirement."

[5] It has been urged, however, that an initiative measure in its effect is a constitutional amendment, and as constitutional amendments need not conform to the provision of the constitution quoted above, this statute need not so conform to it. We are unable to accord any weight whatsoever to this contention. We do not recognize an initiative measure as having any greater strength or dignity than attaches to any other legislation. Throughout section 1 of article IV of the constitution a distinct line of demarcation is kept between a law or an act and a constitutional amendment. It is only another system added to our plan of state government by a permissive amendment to the constitution, but it was at no time intended that such permissive legislation by direct vote should override the other safeguards of the constitution. If an amendment of the constitution were intended, the provision requires steps to be taken that will apprise the voters thereof so that they may intelligently judge of the fitness of such measure as a constituent part of the organic law. We have a state government with three departments, each to check upon the others, and it would be subversive of the very foundation purposes of our government to permit an initiative act of any type to throw out of gear our entire legal mechanism. Our common sense makes us rebel at the suggestion. This question has been before the courts of other states and the holding we here announce has been the holding there without exception.

People v. Prevost, 55 Colo. 199 [134 Pac. 129], was an action for mandamus, relator claiming that an initiative statute adopted by the people at the same election at which they adopted a constitutional amendment must itself be considered as a constitutional amendment and as such modified the amendment adopted by the people. In answer to this contention the supreme court of the state said:

"In order to arrive at that conclusion, he contends that a statute relating to the publication of initiated laws, which was itself initiated and voted upon at the election in November, 1912, was a constitutional amendment, tho in form

200 Cal.—38 594 WALLACE v. ZINMAN. [200 Cal.

a statute. This measure was initiated as a statute, and submitted and voted upon as such. There was nothing in or about it that in any manner indicated that those who had initiated it, or the people who voted upon it, had a thought or a suspicion that it was a constitutional amendment or intended for one. . . . After claiming that the statute would have been unconstitutional if adopted, he contends that the measure, tho to all other appearances and indications a statute, was in fact a constitutional amendment. Reduced to its last analysis, the argument is this: If an initiated measure contravenes the Constitution, tho it is in form a statute, professedly intended as such, with nothing about it to indicate that it was intended for a constitutional amendment, nevertheless it is a constitutional amendment. Such a position cannot be maintained in reason or logic. To say that the people could thus, without intending to do so, and unwittingly, amend their Constitution is a proposition that carries with itself its own refutation. The only reasonable thing that can be said of a measure that in form and to all indicated intents and purposes is a statute which contravenes the Constitution is, not that it is a constitutional amendment, but that it is itself unconstitutional."

To the same effect see State v. Becker, 290 Mo. 560 [235 S. W. 1017, 1021].

And in Galvin v. Board of Supervisors, 195 Cal. 686, 692, 693 [235 Pac. 450], our own court in principle disposes of this question, holding as follows: "The initiative amendment to the Constitution itself must be interpreted in harmony with the other provisions of the organic law of this state of which it has become a part. To construe it otherwise would be to break down and destroy the barriers and limitations which the Constitution, read as a whole, has cast about legislation, both state and local. For example, the Constitution provides in Section 11 of Article XI thereof, that 'Any county, city, town, or township may make and enforce within its limits all such local, police, sanitary and other regulations as are not in conflict with general laws.' This provision of the Constitution constitutes an inhibition against the adoption by counties, whether acting by means of the initiative or otherwise, of local laws and ordinances which are in conflict with general laws, and March, 1927.] WALLACE v. ZINMAN. 595

it was clearly not the intendment of the framers of the initiative amendment or of the people who adopted it to wipe out this salutary provision of the Constitution. Again, the Constitution, in Sections 4 and 5 of Article XI thereof, provides as follows: . . . This grant of power to the legislature to enact general and uniform laws relating to the matters referred to in the foregoing clauses of the Constitution constitutes in itself a limitation upon the power of counties, whether acting thru their regularly constituted legislative bodies or attempting to act directly thru initiative legislation to adopt ordinances or regulations which would have the effect of destroying the uniformity in regard to such matters which the state legislature by the enactment of general and uniform laws was required to create and maintain." (See, also, State v. Richardson, supra.)

It may be said in passing that section 1197a of the Political Code throws no light upon the question before us, as this act could not have been intended to dispense with this requirement as to title.

We must, therefore, hold that the statute in question is subject to section 24 of article IV of the constitution, hereinbefore quoted, and that inasmuch as the provision here under consideration is an independent subject not referred to in the title to said act, so much of said act as comprises this provision is void.

[6] Moreover, this provision contains within itself destructive elements which also compel the conclusion that it is void. It purports to fix a maximum limitation on fees, commissions, and charges with respect to loans negotiated by the broker where such loans are secured within the meaning of that act, with no limitation fixed upon such fees, charges, and commissions when applied to brokers who aid in the negotiation and consummation of unsecured loans except the inhibition against any kind of charges when the loan is not secured by real estate and is to run for a shorter period than six months. In other words, it is plain there is discrimination between charges of brokers negotiating unsecured loans and the same character of charges in negotiating secured loans. There is likewise a discrimination with reference to loans where the period of the loan is less than six months, it being made a crimi- 596 WALLACE v. ZINMAN. [200 Cal.

nal offense to charge a commission of any kind on a loan running for a shorter period than six months unless the loan is secured by a mortgage upon real estate. It was for this very reason that the act of March 20, 1905 (Stats. 1905, p. 422), "an act fixing the rates of interest and charges upon loans on chattel mortgages," was declared invalid in that there was a discrimination between individuals in the same business by allowing a certain rate of interest to some and denying it to others. The court, considering said act, in *Ex parte Sohncke*, 148 Cal. 262, 268 [113 Am. St. Rep. 236, 7 Ann. Cas. 475, 2 L. R. A. (N. S.) 813, 82 Pac. 956, 959], said:

"The business of loaning money is as much a part of domestic trade and commerce as any other legitimate business. There is no substantial reason why those who lend money in sums not exceeding three hundred dollars on chattel mortgages of upholstery, pictures, or works of art, pianos, organs, sewing-machines, safes, professional libraries, or office furniture or fixtures, instruments of surveyors, physicians, or dentists, printing presses, or printing material, should be limited in their charges and the business they do in that respect made less profitable than it otherwise would be, while they or others who lend on chattel mortgages upon instruments of a photographer, livestock, agricultural implements, equipments of livery stables or other property allowed to be mortgaged by section 2955 of the Civil Code (Stats. 1905, p. 36, c. 40), and not enumerated in the act under consideration, or who lend upon pledges of any kind of personal property, or who lend in sums exceeding three hundred dollars upon any kind of security, should be allowed to exact any rate of interest or other charge which they can obtain from the borrower. It is a part of the same kind of business, and there is no distinction between the particular classes of persons or things affected by the act and those exempted from its provisions that will justify special legislation. It may be that such exhorbitant charges should be absolutely prohibited, but, if so, the prohibition should be made general, and should extend to all who engage in the business as lenders on the one hand, and should protect all who are made the victims thereof on the other hand, without discrimination in favor of any." March, 1927.]

WALLACE v. ZINMAN.

There is no essential difference between a broker engaged in negotiating secured loans and one engaged in negotiating unsecured loans and certainly no essential difference between a broker engaged in negotiating loans on real property and one negotiating loans on other classes of security. It may also well be contended that said provision discriminates without intrinsic or constitutional distinction between contenders in other departments of the brokerage business. These discriminations are so plain that it requires but their statement to demonstrate that said provision is in violation of both sections 11 and 21 of article I of the constitution of California, and also the fourteenth amendment to the constitution of the United States.

These views render it unnecessary to give consideration to the further contention of respondent that the provision is invalid because of the previous decisions of this court in the line of cases known as employment agency cases, to wit: Ex parte Dickey, 144 Cal. 234 [103 Am. St. Rep. 82, 1 Ann. Cas. 428, 66 L. R. A. 928, 77 Pac. 924], In re Smith, 193 Cal. 337 [223 Pac. 971], and In re Boynton, 193 Cal. 782 [223 Pac. 972].

In holding this provision to be a violation of the constitution, we are by no means intending to indorse any subterfuge or plan by which the lender could or would secure to himself a greater amount of interest than that provided for by law. We recognize that in every transaction the court will look to the substance thereof and not merely to the form, and if, by any kind of device, the lender is securing a greater benefit than that provided in the law, the contract will be held usurious even though it be cloaked under the guise of a commission, bonus, or other name. This has been made clear by our own court in the case of Blodgett v. Rheinschild, 56 Cal. App. 728, 733 [206 Pac. 674, 676], where the court quotes approvingly this language: "As a general rule, any benefit or advantage exacted by the lender from the borrower, whatever be its name or form, which, added to the interest taken or reserved, would yield to the lender a greater profit upon his loan than is allowed by law is deemed usury (39 Cyc. 971)." (See, also, to the same effect, Niles v. Kavanagh, 179 Cal. 98 [1 A. L. R. 831, 175 Pac. 462].) 598 IN RE WASHER. [200 Cal.

In other words, in holding that a legitimate third party broker in a loan transaction is not covered by this statute, we are not intending to in anywise aid or assist or countenance the lender in taking from the borrower any greater interest charge than that provided by law, whatsoever may be his method of so doing.

We concede no weight to the claim urged that this provision of the act was intended exclusively to allow a commission or bonus to the lender and to have no application to the third party, the broker. The views announced above compel a conclusion which is the reverse of this contention and we hold that the provision was not intended to apply in anywise to increase the profit to the lender beyond the maximum rate of interest specified in the act.

[7] It may be said also in conclusion that the provision of the statute which has been successfully assaulted in this proceeding is clearly severable from the other portions of the act, and whether or not there may be other invalid provisions therein can be of no concern to the parties to this action.

Judgment affirmed.

In the Matter of the Application of W. WASHER for a Writ of Habeas Corpus.

[1] USURY LAW—CONSTRUCTION—EVIDENCES OF DEBT—CRIMINAL LAW. By use, in section 3 of the "Usury Law" (Stats. 1919, p. lxxxiii), of the phrase, " . . . secured by mortgage . . . or other evidence of debt, except corporation bonds and municipal and other bonds . . .," is meant that no offense could be committed by a loan at any rate of interest, however large, upon such property as security; and the preceding words, such as mortgage, trust deed, bill of sale, assignment, pledge or receipt, should be construed to be in and of themselves evidence of debt in the broader sense of that term. March, 1927.]

IN RE WASHER.

[2] Id.—LOANS—DISCRIMINATION AS TO SECURITY—CONSTITUTIONAL LAW.—There is no intrinsic, economic, constitutional, or other reason for a discrimination between loans on ordinary security and loans upon corporate, municipal, or other public bonds, and as section 3 of the "Usury Law" makes such discrimination, this provision is void as being in contravention of the constitution.

[3] Id.—SECTIONS 1 AND 2 OF USURY LAW—CONSTRUCTION.—Sections 1 and 2 of the "Usury Law" are intended to cover secured as well as unsecured loans.

[4] Id.—CORPORATE BONDS—SALE AT DISCOUNT—LOANS.—The sale at discount by corporate borrowers, such as corporations, municipal, and other public corporations, of bonds of their own issue, is not a loan within the meaning of the "Usury Law," and was never intended to be subject to the operation of any of the provisions of this statute.

[5] STATUTORY CONSTRUCTION—CONSTRUCTION OF STATUTES TOGETHER—RULE.—A statute should be construed in the light of other existing legislation touching the same subject matter and statutes in pari materia are to be construed together.

[6] USURY LAW—EFFECT ON OTHER STATUTES—CONSTRUCTION.—It was not the intent of the "Usury Law" to repeal or modify or impair the integrity of any existing laws relating to the issuance, sale, or negotiation of securities now authorized or supervised by any such laws.

[7] Id.—LOAN ON CORPORATE SECURITIES—APPLICATION OF USURY LAW. A loan upon corporate bonds as security in excess of the legal rate would be just as usurious as a loan on any other class of security.

[8] HABEAS CORPUS—REHEARING—PRACTICE.—There is no practice in the supreme court allowing petitions for rehearing in case of habeas corpus. (On denial of rehearing.)

APPLICATION for a Writ of Habeas Corpus to release petitioner from custody after conviction of violation of the Usury Act. Writ discharged. Petitioner remanded.

The facts are stated in the opinion of the court.

Charles Greenberg, Schweitzer & Hutton and Henry Haves, for Petitioner.

J. M. Friedlander, City Prosecutor, E. J. Lickley, City Prosecutor, Vernon S. Gray and Ford M. Jack, Deputies City Prosecutor, for Respondent.

Laurence W. Beilenson, Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher and Norman S. Sterry, *Amici Curiae*.

PRESTON, J.—Petitioner was convicted and imprisoned for violation of the statute known as the "Usury Act," the complaint alleging that he "did wilfully and unlawfully ask, demand, receive, take, accept and charge of and from" certain individuals more than twelve per cent per annum on a $7,000 loan "for the forbearance, use and loan of said sum of money; payment . . . being secured by an evidence of debt, to wit: a trust deed upon real property . . . and by a promissory note" executed in favor of petitioner.

The district court of appeal rendered a decision discharging the writ of habeas corpus and remanding petitioner to custody (*In re Washer*, 78 Cal. App. 758 [248 Pac. 1068]), whereupon he again petitioned for his release from durance upon the ground, as hereinafter set forth, that the said Usury Law is unconstitutional and void.

This contention requires a consideration of the statute approved by popular vote November 5, 1918 (Stats. 1919, p. lxxxiii), known as the "Usury Law," and particularly that portion of section 3 thereof which reads as follows:

"And any person, company, association or corporation, who shall ask, demand, receive, take, accept or charge more than twelve per centum per annum upon the sum of money actually loaned for the forbearance, use or loan thereof, when the repayment of the money loaned shall be secured March, 1927.] IN RE WASHER. 601

by a mortgage, trust deed, bill of sale, assignment, pledge, receipt or other evidence of debt, except corporation bonds, and municipal and other public bonds, upon property, real or personal . . . shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof shall be punished for the first offense by a fine of not less than twenty-five dollars nor more than three hundred dollars, or by imprisonment not more than six months, or by both such fine and imprisonment, and for each subsequent offense and conviction shall be punished by a fine not less than one hundred dollars nor more than five hundred dollars and by imprisonment not less than six months nor more than one year."

The storm center of attack is the portion thereof which, when paraphrased, reads: "And any person . . . who shall . . . charge more than twelve per centum per annum upon the sum . . . loaned . . . when repayment . . . shall be secured by a mortgage, . . . or other evidence of debt, except corporation bonds, and municipal and other public bonds . . . shall be guilty of a misdemeanor . . . "

Petitioner contends that this provision of the statute violates article I, section 11, of the constitution of California; also article I, section 21 thereof; and also the fourteenth amendment to the constitution of the United States, in that it provides that a criminal penalty shall attach to any person, company, association, or corporation who shall exact more than twelve per cent per annum upon a sum of money loaned and secured by any other class of security than corporation bonds, municipal or other public bonds, but as to the lender upon such last mentioned securities no criminal or other penalty attaches for what amounts to the same act. In other words, the contention of petitioner is that there is no economic, intrinsic, constitutional difference between loans secured by corporate bonds or municipal or other public bonds and loans secured by other forms of security or collateral.

Respondent, however, urges that the clause should not be construed to mean that a lender on corporate or other bonds is in any different class from a lender on other securities, but that it should be construed to mean that the corporate entities mentioned may negotiate and sell the bonds of their own issuance at any discount or rate of interest they may deem fit without incurring the penalty 602 IN RE WASHER. [200 Cal.
of the law. In other words, respondent would have us hold that the clause referred to means "evidenced by" and not "secured by" corporation bonds, etc. To be more specific, his contention is that the phrase should be construed as though it read: "Except a loan by a borrower upon corporation bonds, municipal bonds and other public bonds."

A careful research of the authorities and the statutes of the various states on usury convinces us that the draftsman of this measure had before him almost exclusively in his work the Wisconsin Usury Act (Wis. Stats. 1917, p. 1346), for we find section 1 of our Usury Act to be almost a perfect reproduction of section 1688 of the Wisconsin statute; also section 2 of our statute is practically a duplicate of section 1689 of the Wisconsin law. Indeed, the first paragraph of section 3 of our law finds its duplicate in the first paragraph of section 1691 of the Wisconsin law and undoubtedly paragraph 3 of said section 1691 of the Wisconsin law was the inspiration of the draftsman when he produced the provision now under consideration. The Wisconsin law in this behalf provides as follows:

"Sec. 1691, par. 3: And when the payment of the money loaned shall be secured, or purport to be secured, or claimed by the payee of said loan to be secured, by chattel mortgage, bill of sale, pledge, receipt or other evidence of debt upon chattel goods or property, or by assignment of wages, or by power of attorney to execute any such instrument on behalf of the borrower, whether any such instrument or the power given to execute the same, shall be valid or not, or whether any such instrument or power shall be fully executed or executed partly in blank, any person who, as principal or as agent for another, shall ask, demand, or receive, take, accept or charge, in addition to the interest aforesaid, more than an amount equal to seven per centum per annum of the original sum actually loaned for the time of such loan, on sums of a hundred dollars or less, nor more than four per cent per annum of the original sum actually loaned for time of such loan, on sums over one hundred dollars, disregarding part payments and the dates thereof, but not to be computed for a period exceeding one year in any event, in full for all examinations, views, fees, appraisals, commissions, re- March, 1927.] IN RE WASHER. 603

newals and charges of any kind or description whatsoever in the procuring, making and transacting of the business connected with such loan, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. . . . "

A consideration of this provision shows that it refers to personal property loans and allows the lender on personal property not only the rate of interest provided with respect to other loans but also a further charge by way of commissions, examinations, fees, appraisals, renewals, etc. In other words, this provision of the statute was intended to control loans upon chattels and was not intended to make any distinction between secured and unsecured loans in any other respect. It is an appeal to the police power of the state for the regulation of pawnbrokers and other personal property brokers, a subject to which an appeal to the police power has been made in practically every state of the Union. Indeed, similar legislation is on the statute books in California and has been declared a proper subject for the operation of police power and, therefore, valid. (See *Eaker v. Bryant*, 24 Cal. App. 87 [140 Pac. 310]; *Levinson v. Boas*, 150 Cal. 185 [11 Ann. Cas. 661, 12 L. R. A. (N. S.) 575, 88 Pac. 825]; *Ex parte Lichenstein*, 67 Cal. 359 [56 Am. Rep. 713, 7 Pac. 728].)

It would appear, therefore, that the draftsman of the Usury Law statute of California undertook to broaden the provision respecting personal property loans so as to include secured obligations of all kinds on real and personal property except corporate bonds, municipal and other public bonds, without realizing that the preceding sections of the act fully covered secured loans. It should also be noted that the draftsman of our statute did not desire that the lender have any commission or other emolument that would enhance his interest charge and so create an independent provision respecting loan brokers which undertook also to limit their charges. This latter effort was held to have been invalid and abortive in *Wallace v. Zinman, ante*, p. 585 [254 Pac. 946]. So the language of this exception and the connection in which it is found convinces us that the draftsman of the Usury Law of California, after grappling with his many problems, lost himself and with drawn sword was stabbing at imaginary 604 IN RE WASHER. [200 Cal.
enemies in the darkness when he inserted the clause now under consideration in the act.

[1] However this may be, we cannot escape the conclusion that by use of the phrase "...secured by mortgage...or other evidence of debt, except corporation bonds, and municipal and other public bonds..." is meant that no offense could be committed by a loan at any rate of interest, however large, upon such property as security. We find no difficulty in construing the preceding words, such as mortgage, trust deed, bill of sale, assignment, pledge, or receipt, to be in and of themselves evidence of debt in the broader sense of that term. We are mindful of the rules of construction which must bind us, which said rules are as follows:

"Absurd or unjust results will never be ascribed to the legislature and it will not be presumed to have used inconsistent provisions as to the same subject in the immediate context. The courts will be astute to avoid such results (Wells Fargo & Co. v. Mayor etc. of Jersey City, 207 Fed. 871). In the interpretation of statutes courts are not bound by grammatical rules, and may ascertain the meaning of words by the context. (Cavender v. Hewitt, 145 Tenn. 471 [22 A. L. R. 755, 239 S. W. 767].)

"The mere literal construction of a section in a statute ought not to prevail if it is opposed to the intention of the legislature apparent by the statute; and if the words are sufficiently flexible to admit of some other construction it is to be adopted to effectuate that intention. The intent prevails over the letter, and the letter will, if possible, be so read as to conform to the spirit of the act. "While the intention of the legislature must be ascertained from the words used to express it, the manifest reason and the obvious purpose of the law should not be sacrificed to a literal interpretation of such words." Words or clauses may be enlarged or restricted to effectuate the intention or to harmonize them with other expressed provisions. Where general language construed in a broad sense would lead to absurdity it may be restrained. The particular inquiry is not what is the abstract force of the words or what they may comprehend, but in what sense they were intended to be used as they are found in the act." (Lewis' Sutherland on Statutory Construction, 2d ed., sec. 376, p. March, 1927.]

IN RE WASHER.

721.)" (In re Haincs, 195 Cal. 605, 613 [234 Pac. 883, 886].)

But notwithstanding the liberality and flexibility of these rules, we are unable to put any different construction on this clause than the plain meaning afforded by the ordinary import of the words. To give the construction contended for by respondent, it is necessary for the borrower to make a loan to the lender and thus to twist the words out of joint to such length that the borrower while going on must meet himself coming back. We do not feel able to indulge the verbal gymnastics necessary to make the meaning out of this phrase contended for by respondent and therefore conclude that petitioner has properly construed its meaning. [2] It is conceded that no intrinsic, economic, constitutional, or other reason exists for a discrimination between loans on ordinary security and loans upon corporate, municipal, or other public bonds, and the provision must, therefore, be adjudged void as being in contravention of the above specified plain mandates of the constitution.

[3] But, notwithstanding our views to the effect that the provision is discriminatory and void, we nevertheless would reach the same result for all practical purposes, if we adopted the construction contended for by respondent. In other words that sections 1 and 2 of the act are intended to cover secured as well as unsecured loans. The clauses are all-comprehensive in their meaning and no reason whatsoever exists for making a special provision respecting unsecured loans; therefore, if the clause in question were given the full meaning contended for by respondent, it would be at most nothing more than surplusage, for it would have been previously covered by the provisions of sections 1 and 2. [4] This provision would in that case be surplusage because the sale at a discount by corporate borrowers, such as corporations, municipal, and other public corporations, of bonds of their own issue, is not, in our opinion, a loan within the meaning of the Usury Law and was never intended to be subject to the operation of any of the provisions of this statute. The sale of certain classes of corporate bonds is controlled by what is known as the Corporate Securities Act, approved May 18, 1917, together with its amendatory and supple- 606

mentary provisions since that time (Deering's Gen. Laws 1923, part 1, p. 1407, Act 3814).

Municipal bonds and bonds of other public corporations are authorized by special provisions of the statute or constitution, are first voted by the people, residents of the territory included, and are then placed upon the market by competent boards of directors or trustees elected or appointed for the purpose. Indeed, in the operation of many city governments, they are, by reason of section 6 of article XI of the constitution, free from the operation of general laws at all. (Civic Center v. Railroad Com., 175 Cal. 441 [166 Pac. 351]; Morgan v. City of Los Angeles, 182 Cal. 301, 305 [187 Pac. 1050].)

Then, too, we have section 23 of article XII of the constitution, conferring broad powers upon the Railroad Commission of the state of California, which amendment has been followed by a comprehensive statute known as the Public Utilities Act (Deering's Gen. Laws 1923, part 2, Act 6386, p. 2683), which act empowers the Railroad Commission to supervise the issuance, sale, and disposition of bonds of all public utilities. Likewise certain powers of a similar nature are conferred by what is known as the Bank Act of the state of California (Deering's Gen. Laws 1923, part 1, Act 652, p. 153.)

These, and perhaps many other statutes, are the result of the best wisdom of our state and involve some of its most important and most cherished functions and it is not for a moment to be held that this system of beneficent laws was to be set awry by a poorly drafted act meant only to protect the individual necessitous borrower from the rapacity of the more fortunate lender.

[5] A statute should be construed in the light of other existing legislation touching the same subject matter and statutes in pari materia, are to be construed together. (McGrath v. Kaeline, 66 Cal. App. 41, 44 [225 Pac. 34].)

[6] So construing them, we hold that it was not the intent of the act to repeal or modify or impair the integrity of any existing laws relating to the issuance, sale, or negotiation of securities now authorized or supervised by any such laws. This act provides for the express repeal of only sections 1917, 1918, 1919, and 1920 of the Civil Code, and the full operation of statutes respecting the control March, 1927.]

of corporate securities, public or private, will not be deemed hampered in any way by the act in question. We are not here deciding what may be the effect of the act upon existing statutes regulating the business of pawnbrokers and other personal property brokers.

Many states, such as Illinois, Virginia, Wisconsin, New York, Maryland, Delaware, North Carolina, and South Carolina, have met the question by expressly denying to corporations the right to plead usury. But the weight of authority is that, independent of existing regulatory enactments, the sale and negotiation of bonds by corporations, public and private, are not loans within the meaning of the usury laws. 39 Cyc., page 936, states the rule as follows: "But by the weight of authority such bonds are regarded as having a valid existence and transferable quality in the hands of the issuing corporation and thus subject to sale at their market value, which may be at a discount much greater than legal interest, without making them subject to the taint of usury in the hands of an immediate purchaser." (See, also, Griffith v. Burden, 35 Iowa, 138, 143; Kornegay v. City of Goldsboro, 180 N. C. 441 [105 S. E. 187, 193], and cases there cited; Memphis v. Bethel (Tenn.), 17 S. W. 191; Orchard v. School District, 14 Neb. 378 [15 N. W. 730, 731]; Armstrong v. Freeman, 9 Neb. 11 [2 N. W. 353], New River Lumber Co. v. Tennessee Ry. Co., 136 Tenn. 661 [191 S. W. 334, 340], and White Water Valley Canal Co. v. Vallette et al., 21 How. (62 U. S.) 414, 425 [16 L. Ed. 154, see, also, Rose's U. S. Notes].)

Corporations, public and private, are, as we have pointed out, protected and supervised by specific laws applicable alone to them and no reason exists for further regulation. On the contrary, such a law, if applied to them, would have a mistaken effect, for instead of helping them as the design of the usury law implies, the practical effect would be to discourage and hamper the free commerce among our people in this popular class of securities to the detriment of the public welfare. A loss of confidence in these securities would work a positive and widespread injury to our otherwise strong and healthy business fabric. 608 IN RE WASHER. [200 Cal.
The inevitable conclusion from these views is that sections 1 and 2 of the act known as the Usury Law are, in all respects, valid and cover both secured and unsecured obligations, and that section 3 of said statute, taken in connection with the decision in *Wallace v. Zinman, ante*, p. 585 [254 Pac. 946], should be construed as though it read as follows:

"Sec. 3. Every person, company, association or corporation, who for any loan or forbearance of money, goods or things in action shall have paid or delivered any greater sum or value than is allowed to be received under the preceding sections, one and two, may either in person or his or its personal representative, recover in an action at law against the person, company, association or corporation who shall have taken or received the same, or his or its personal representative, treble the amount of the money so paid or value delivered in violation of said sections, providing such action shall be brought within one year after such payment or delivery. And any person, company, association or corporation who shall violate the provisions of sections one and two of this act shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof shall be punished for the first offense by a fine of not less than twenty-five dollars nor more than three hundred dollars, or by imprisonment not more than six months, or by both such fine and imprisonment, and for each subsequent offense and conviction shall be punished by a fine not less than one hundred dollars nor more than five hundred dollars and by imprisonment not less than six months nor more than one year. The penalties herein provided for the violation of this section and said sections one and two shall apply to and be imposed upon each member of any unincorporated company, association, or of any copartnership and upon each officer and director of a corporation who shall violate either of said sections."

[7] A loan, therefore, upon corporate bonds as security in excess of the legal rate would be just as usurious as a loan on any other class of security.

The above conclusion disposes of the contention of *amici curiae* that violence would be done to the legislative intent by striking down the provisions of the second portion of section 3, involved herein, and leaving in operation March, 1927.] HAINES v. COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE Co. 609

sections 1 and 2 and the remaining paragraphs of section 3 of said act. The provision is either void or surplusage and, being clearly severable, no violence has been done the legislative intent.

It follows that with this exception the statute as a whole is valid and free from constitutional objection and that specific objections to all provisions thereof affecting petitioner are without merit. The petitioner being charged with a violation of valid provisions of said act, his conviction and imprisonment were proper.

Writ discharged and petitioner remanded to custody.

Shenk, J., Curtis, J., Richards, J., Seawell, J., Waste, C. J., and Langdon J., concurred.

In denying a rehearing on March 31, 1927, the court filed the following opinion:

THE COURT.—The petition for a rehearing herein is denied.

[8] There is no practice here allowing petitions for rehearing in case of habeas corpus. (Ex parte Robinson, 71 Cal. 608-611 [12 Pac. 794]; In re Travers, 48 Cal. App. 764, 771 [192 Pac. 454].)

FRANCIS S. HAINES et al., Respondents, v. COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE COMPANY (a Corporation) et al., Appellants.

[1] USURY LAW—CONSTRUCTION—LIMIT OF INTEREST—COMPOUND INTEREST.—Under the "Usury Law" (Stats. 1919, p. lxxxiii), the maximum rate of twelve per cent per annum on the amount loaned is the full measure of all profit to the lender, and without the right to compound the interest; but it is competent for the parties to contract in writing for compound interest where in so doing the maximum rate of twelve per cent without such compounding would not be exceeded.

200 Cal.—39 610 HAINES v. COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE CO. [200 Cal.

[2] Id.—SERVICES AND EXPENSE OF LENDER—RIGHT OF REIMBURSEMENT. Under the "Usury Law," the lender may perform services or incur expenses in connection with the loan which will entitle him to reimburse himself from the fund about to be loaned, but these items must be confined to specific service or expense incidental to the loan, incurred in such a way as to absolutely preclude its being merely a device through which additional interest or profit on the loan may be exacted, and a court will carefully scrutinize the whole transaction and declare its substance regardless of its form.

[3] Id.—EXCESS CHARGE.—Where a percentage charged on a loan by the borrower in excess of the maximum percentage allowed by the "Usury Law" cannot be allocated to any item of expense or service for which the lenders would legitimately make a charge or urge a claim, the loan is usurious and the lender forfeits all claim to interest, and the borrower may recover not only treble the excess but treble the entire amount of interest actually paid upon the loan.

[4] Id.—AGREEMENT FOR EXCESS AMOUNT—FAILURE TO PAY—JUDGMENT.—Where the excess percentage agreed to be paid upon a loan in addition to the maximum percentage allowed by the "Usury Law" is not actually paid, it is not a proper item in a judgment for treble the amount allowed by the statute to be recovered.

[5] Id.—PAYMENT—AGREEMENT FOR APPLICATION.—Where the parties to a loan have by special and specific agreement agreed as to what portion of a given payment shall be referred to principal and what shall be referred to interest, the court will adopt this understanding in applying the provisions of the "Usury Law."

[6] Id.—SUIT IN EQUITY TO DECLARE A FORFEITURE AND ENJOIN A SALE—DISPOSAL OF ISSUES.—In a suit in equity to have a transaction declared in violation of the "Usury Act," the right to future interest declared forfeited, that no part of the principal be declared payable until the completion of the full period of time contemplated by the note, that plaintiff recover treble the amount of all interest paid, including treble the amount of the commission, and that a sale of the premises securing the loan be enjoined until the full period covered by the loan should have elapsed, the court should assume full and complete jurisdiction in the premises and make and state the account between the parties and make plenary disposition of all the issues involved in the action.

[7] Id.—NATURE OF ACTION.—While the provision of the "Usury Law" for a special right of action in the plaintiff for treble the amount

5. See 27 R. C. L. 276. March, 1927.] HAINES v. COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE Co. 611

of interest paid is in the nature of a penalty, the context of the act gives it more of the rating of an action for debt and, therefore, subject to offsets and counterclaims by defendants; and the plaintiffs in such an action waive the right to object to offsets and counterclaims by coming into a court of equity and praying for additional relief instead of the mere pronouncement of a judgment in forfeiture against the defendants.

[8] Id.—DOING EQUITY—TENDER.—There is no merit in the contention in such an action that plaintiffs must first do equity by tendering the principal and such other items, excluding interest, as may be due under the obligation, before suit may be maintained for treble the interest paid.

[9] Id.—NOTE PAYABLE IN INSTALLMENTS—USURIOUS INTEREST—APPLICATION OF PAYMENTS.—Where a promissory note provides for payment of principal and interest in monthly installments and that in default of payment of any installment when due the whole sum of principal and interest shall become immediately due and payable at the option of the holder of the note, if the agreement for payment of interest is usurious, all payments will be referred to the principal, but if default is made in the payment of an installment in full the note may be declared due and payable at the option of the holder.

[10] Id.—FORFEITURE—PRINCIPAL.—Under the "Usury Law" the legislative intent was not to declare the whole contract void on account of usurious interest, but only the portion thereof relating to interest, and the forfeiture of principal is not authorized by the statute. (On petition for rehearing.)

[11] Id.—CRIMINAL PROVISIONS—CONSTRUCTION.—Provisions of the "Usury Law" declaring the taking of usury a misdemeanor relate only to the question of interest and bear no relation whatever to the loan or repayment of the principal sum. (On denial of rehearing.)

[12] Id.—COMPOUNDING OF INTEREST.—The contention that the "Usury Law" allows the compounding of the interest, if not paid at the time provided for, as long as the limit of the rate of interest is maintained at twelve per cent per annum, cannot be maintained; but within the maximum limit the parties may contract freely in respect to interest and may compound it and also charge commission and bonuses, but such charges must, when added to the interest specified and spread over the whole period of forbearance, be kept within the limit set by the law; and in such case the contract at the maximum rate may not provide for interest upon any unpaid installment when due, nor at the maximum rate may interest be lawfully collected in advance; and if interest is deducted in advance from the amount of the loan, in testing the transaction for usury the principal sum loaned will be held to be 612 HAINES v. COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE CO. [200 Cal.

the amount of the loan less the interest or commission deducted in advance. (On denial of rehearing.)

[13] Id.—MAXIMUM INTEREST—TIME OF PAYMENT.—No legal objection exists to providing in a loan contract that it shall bear the maximum rate of interest, payable at the end of any particular period, such as monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, or annually, during the full period of forbearance, provided that such installments as fall due will be without accruing interest thereon, except upon a new contract and new consideration. (On denial of rehearing.)

[14] Id.—USURIOUS INTEREST—SUIT TO DECLARE FORFEITURE—TENDER—PLEADING.—In a suit in equity where the extent of the prayer covers two subjects only, to wit: Forfeiture of interest and forfeiture of the right to declare the debt due until the full period of time contracted for has elapsed, plaintiff is not required to tender the principal sum and such other items, excluding interest, as might be due under the obligation before suit can be maintained.

PRESTON, J.—Respondents, plaintiffs below, executed to appellant and defendant below, Commercial Mortgage Company, a note as follows:

"$34,000.00. Los Angeles, California, July 2, 1924.

"In installments and at the times hereinafter stated, for value received, we, jointly and severally, promise to March, 1927.] HAINES v. COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE Co. 613

pay to Commercial Mortgage Company, a corporation, or order, at its offices in Los Angeles, California, the principal sum of Thirty-four thousand and no/100 Dollars, with interest from date on the amount of principal remaining from time to time unpaid until said principal sum is paid at the rate of twelve per cent per annum. Principal and interest payable in monthly installments of Eight hundred and no/100 ($800) Dollars or more each on the first day of each and every month, beginning on the 1st day of September, 1924, and continuing until said principal and interest thereon have been fully paid. Each payment shall be credited first, on interest then due; and the remainder on the principal sum, and interest shall thereupon cease upon the amount so credited as the said principal sum. Should default be made in payment of any installment when due, then the whole sum of principal and interest shall become immediately due and payable at the option of the holder of this note. Principal and interest payable in Gold Coin of the United States, of the present standard. This note is secured by a certain Deed of Trust to Title Insurance and Trust Company, a corporation, of Los Angeles, California.

A trust deed to secure payment was, as a part of the same transaction, executed to the other defendant and appellant, Title Insurance and Trust Company, as trustee. Eight monthly payments of $800 each were made on the said note at the times called for therein, of which said eight payments $2,953.11 in the aggregate was, by special agreement of the parties, referred to interest, and the remainder, aggregating $3,446.89, referred to payment on the principal. Default then occurred in said payments and the record discloses no payments thereon since said time. The legal steps necessary to declare the whole principal debt due were taken and foreclosure and sale of the property covered by the trust deed was about to be made when the present action was commenced. 614 HAINES v. COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE Co. [200 Cal.

The complaint filed on January 13, 1925, and as later amended, alleges that said transaction was usurious in that the defendant mortgage company exacted a commission of three per cent upon the loan, or $1,020, in addition to the twelve per cent per annum provided for in the said note. It also alleges the payment of an additional sum of $5 as an appraiser's fee. The prayer was that the loan be declared a transaction in violation of the Usury Act; that the right to future interest be declared forfeited; that no part of the principal be declared payable until the completion of the full period of time contemplated by the note; that plaintiffs recover treble the amount of all interest paid, including treble the amount of said commission of three per cent, or $1,020; that a sale of the premises be enjoined and forbidden until the fullness of the period covered by said loan should have elapsed; for costs of suit and for general relief.

The answer admits the execution of the note and trust deed; admits that a charge of three per cent on said principal amount, or $1,020, was charged and made a part of said note, but alleges that said amount was for "examination, views, fees, appraisals, commissions and all charges" in transacting the business of the loan as provided for in the so-called Usury Act. It denies specifically that any taint of usury inheres in said transaction and further pleads that defendants had ordered a sale under the trust deed; that the trustee had recorded the declaration of default not only for the whole of the principal and interest and trustee's charges, but also for the advances made on account of principal and interest on a prior encumbrance on the property covered by the trust deed.

The court sustained the contentions of plaintiffs and found that although the face of the note was $34,000, plaintiffs received but $32,980, the $1,020, or three per cent of the principal amount, being included in the note; that the plaintiff, H. E. Ketchum, called at the joint office of the defendant, Commercial Mortgage Company, and Commercial Loan Company, and there met in the office of Eugene Webb, Jr., an officer and director of both above-named loan companies, a man by the name of Ellsworth Pexton, who claimed to be acting for said Eugene Webb, Jr.; that said H. E. Ketchum there made and filed an ap- March, 1927.] HAINES v. COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE CO. 615

plication in writing for a loan of $34,000, agreeing to pay said Webb a three per cent commission on said amount, and to give a note and trust deed by himself and coplaintiffs to secure payment. The court further found that the transaction was carried out in other respects as alleged in the complaint and in addition thereto found a prior encumbrance of $82,000 existing on the property and that defendant mortgage company, to prevent a foreclosure thereof, had paid on account of principal and interest thereon the sum of $7,974. The further findings material to this decision are found in the opening paragraphs hereof.

The court adjudged the transaction usurious and provided that plaintiffs have judgment for $11,919.33, being treble the item of $1,020 plus treble the aggregate amount of said items of interest, to wit: $2,953.11. The judgment further provided "that defendants are, and each is, hereby restrained and enjoined from foreclosing said trust deed and selling said security for any default in payment of any interest demand on said loan."

Counsel for appellants and also several amici curiae make spirited and vigorous attacks not only upon the validity of the Usury Act but, assuming it to be valid, upon the manner in which the court below administered the act in this case. Fortunately for the length of this opinion all of the points made against the validity of the Usury Act as a whole have been considered in the cases of Wallace v. Zinman, ante, p. 585 [254 Pac. 946], and In re Washer, ante, p. 598 [254 Pac. 951].

In the former we held the statute as a whole to be valid and without violence to any provision of the constitution, except that a certain clause thereof not involved in the case now before us was declared invalid. In the latter we also held abortive the effort found in the act to fix limitations upon the charges of loan brokers and agents. In both cases we held it to be the manifest intent of the act to forbid absolutely to the lender any profit whatever by way of commission, bonus or other kind of charge, if in so doing the maximum rate declared in the act was exceeded.

[1] A further consideration of the question leaves us entirely satisfied with these conclusions. If there is anything that is made clear and plain by the act, it is that the 616 HAINES v. COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE CO. [200 Cal.

maximum rate of twelve per cent per annum on the amount loaned is the full measure of all profit to the lender in connection therewith and this, too, without even the right in such case to compound the interest in any computation thereon. Of course, it is competent for the parties to contract in writing for compound interest where in so doing the said maximum rate of twelve per cent without such compounding would not be exceeded. Language in the act as follows, to wit: "No person, company, association or corporation shall directly or indirectly take or receive in money, goods, or things in action, or in any other manner whatsoever, any greater sum or any greater value for the loan or forbearance of money, goods or things in action than at the rate of twelve dollars upon one hundred dollars for one year; and in the computation of interest upon any bond, note, or other instrument or agreement, interest shall not be compounded, nor shall the interest thereon be construed to bear interest unless an agreement to that effect is clearly expressed in writing and signed by the parties to be charged therewith . . ." makes these conclusions unavoidable.

[2] Of course, we are by no means intending to hold that the lender may not perform services or incur expenses in connection with a loan which would entitle him to reimburse himself from the fund about to be loaned to the borrower, but we do mean to state that these items must be confined to specific service or expense incidental to the loan incurred in such a way as to absolutely preclude its being merely a device through which additional interest or profit on the loan may be exacted, and in this connection the court will carefully scrutinize the whole transaction and declare its substance regardless of its form.

"It is true that in determining whether or not the transaction is usurious the court 'will disregard its form and look to the substance, and will condemn it if all of the requisites of usury are found to be present, despite any disguise it may wear.' *First National Bank v. Phares*, 70 Okl. 255 [21 A. L. R. 793, 174 Pac. 519]. See, also, a great number of cases cited in 21 A. L. R. 808 and 809; . . ." (*Friedman v. Wisconsin Acceptance Corp.* (Wis.), 210 N. W. 831.) March, 1927.] HAINES v. COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE Co. 617

Blodgett v. Rheinschild, 56 Cal. App. 728, 732 [206 Pac. 674], is in point as follows: "The $400 actually loaned to defendant was the property of plaintiff; the latter himself negotiated the loan directly with defendant—that is, there was no agent or intermediary in the transaction; there was, therefore, no occasion for the payment of a 'commission' by either the borrower or the lender. Designating the $20 as a 'commission' did not make it such. This word 'commission' was but a euphemism, employed in an attempt to justify the exaction of a greater sum for the loan than at the rate of $12 upon $100 for one year—the maximum amount that a lender is entitled to ask or receive since the present usury law was adopted at the general election held November 5, 1918. The device of a 'commission' has, therefore, the characteristics of a shift to circumvent and avoid the usury law. 'As a general rule, any benefit or advantage exacted by the lender from the borrower, whatever be its name or form, which, added to the interest taken or reserved, would yield to the lender a greater profit upon his loan than is allowed by law is deemed usury.' (39 Cyc. 971.)"

[3] The charge of three per cent in this case cannot be allocated to any item of expense or service for which the lender could legitimately make a charge or urge a claim. The court was fully warranted by the evidence in making the finding that it was a fee or bonus exacted in a manner so as to stamp it as an additional charge for interest on the loan. The loan, already loaded with the maximum interest charge, was supplemented by this item of $1,020, which said item was clearly a distinct usurious exaction from the borrower. We have no hesitancy in also holding that in such case the lender forfeits all claim to interest and the borrower may recover not only treble the excess but treble the entire amount of interest actually paid upon the loan, for the unmistakable declaration of the statute is to this effect. Besides similar statutes have been construed and practically without exception such has been the holding of the several courts. (Taylor v. Parker, 137 N. C. 418 [49 S. E. 921]; Sloan v. Piedmont Fire Ins. Co., 189 N. C. 690 [128 S. E. 2]; Ardmore State Bank v. Thompson, 57 Okl. 521 [164 Pac. 977]; Waldner v. Bowdon State Bank, 13 N. D. 604 [3 Ann. Cas. 847, 102 N. W. 169]; 618 HAINES v. COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE CO. [200 Cal.

First National Bank of Benton v. Watt, 184 U. S. 151 [46 L. Ed. 475, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 457, see, also, Rose's U. S. Notes]; 27 R. C. L., pp. 274, 275, sec. 77.)

[4] In this connection, however, it should be observed that the three per cent charge, totaling $1,020, was not actually paid and is, therefore, not a proper item of said judgment for trebling the amount thereof. The court gave judgment for $11,919.33, which is treble the item of $3,973.11, which latter item is composed of an interest charge of $2,953.11 on the eight installments paid on the notes, plus the commission or bonus charge of $1,020. The only item appearing in the record that should have been trebled is the item of $2,953.11. The item of $1,020 simply becomes surplusage and not only cannot be collected but cannot be the basis of apportionment for either principal or interest, and the payments on account of principal will serve to reduce the net principal and will not be construed as a payment of said charge of $1,020, either in whole or in part. To authorize the infliction of the penalty the interest must, of course, be paid. (Coulter v. Collins, 71 Cal. App. 381 [235 Pac. 465]; 27 R. C. L., p. 275, sec. 78.)

[5] In this connection it is also true that where the parties have by special and specific agreement, as in the case at bar, agreed as to what portion of a given payment shall be referred to principal and what shall be referred to interest, the court will adopt this understanding in applying the provisions of the Usury Law. (27 R. C. L., p. 276, sec. 79.) The holding, therefore, that plaintiff was entitled to $11,919.33 is not supported by the evidence and was, therefore erroneous.

In this behalf it is contended by appellant that the court precluded it from showing that the three per cent charge was for actual services rendered to the borrower by the lender. There is no substance in this claim. The facts surrounding the charge of three per cent were fully exploited. The only ruling in any way curtailing the defendants was disallowing evidence as to future services that defendants might be called upon to perform in checking the status of the building operations on the property. While it is conceivable that a charge of some kind might be proper under certain circumstances, there is nothing March, 1927.] HAINES v. COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE CO. 619

to show nor is it claimed that the $1,020 was exacted to cover this possible future service.

[6] However, as we have noted above, the judgment pronounced by the court in this case restrains and enjoins the defendants from selling said security for any default in payment of interest on said loan. And the court found said promissory note provided for monthly installments of $800 or more each, payable on the first day of each month, and that should default be made in the payment of any installment when due, the whole sum of principal and interest should become immediately due and payable at the option of the holder of the note; also that appellant mortgage company had paid the sum of $7,974 in partial discharge of principal and interest upon a prior mortgage lien existing upon the property involved herein; also that steps had been taken by the trustee to foreclose the deed of trust and expose the security to sale thereunder.

Notwithstanding these several facts the court, sitting as a court of equity at the instigation of plaintiffs, did not dispose of the issue tendered by the above-mentioned facts, but, as we have noted above, rendered only a partial decision in the matter. These several facts above noted, in our opinion, made it incumbent upon the court below, as such court of equity, to assume full and complete jurisdiction in the premises and make and state the account between the parties and make plenary disposition of all the issues involved in the action (25 Cal. Jur., sec. 53, pp. 69, 70). [7] While the provision for a special right of action in plaintiff for treble the amount of interest paid is in the nature of a penalty, the context of the act gives it more of the rating of an action for debt and therefore subject to offsets and counterclaims by defendants. Besides, were this not true, the plaintiffs waived the right to object to offsets and counterclaims by coming into a court of equity and praying for additional relief instead of the mere pronouncement of a judgment in forfeiture against the defendant mortgage company. Equity, having once acquired jurisdiction, as we have noted above, will administer the whole issue.

[8] We accord no merit to the contention of appellants, also of *amici curiae*, that plaintiffs must first do equity by 620 HAINES v. COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE CO. [200 Cal.

tendering the principal and such other items, excluding interest, as may be due under the obligation, before suit may be maintained for treble the interest paid. This contention is the general rule (27 R. C. L., p. 264, sec. 67, and cases cited), but this rule has no application to the special remedy allowed the borrower under this act when the action is commenced within one year after payment. (27 R. C. L., pp. 274, 275, sec. 77; Second National Bank v. Fitzpatrick, 111 Ky. 228 [62 L. R. A. 599, 63 S. W. 459].) This construction is plain from the language of the act itself.

[9] But we are yet met with another question in this case. The act further provides: "Any agreement or contract of any nature in conflict with the provisions of this section shall be null and void as to any agreement or stipulation therein contained to pay interest and no action at law to recover interest in any sum shall be maintained and the debt cannot be declared due until the full period of time it was contracted for has elapsed." Does this provision affect the maturity date of the promissory note before us? A careful consideration of the provision convinces us that the intent is that the maturity date of the obligation cannot be accelerated, if the option to declare the whole of the principal debt due is dependent solely upon nonpayment of usurious interest. In other words, if the note provides for installment payments on the principal as well as the payment of interest and gives the right to the holder to declare the whole debt due for nonpayment of either principal or interest, the forfeiture of the right as to interest could not destroy or affect the remaining right as to principal. From a consideration of the note involved in this action it will be seen that it is an installment note without a definite date of maturity. It specifically provides for payments of $800 or more monthly. How soon such an obligation would be finally matured and paid cannot be definitely foretold, unless interest be excluded and the payments are confined to $800 per month and all applied on the principal.

Respondent seems to contend that such date of maturity should be determined as though the situation were the creation of a sinking fund by these monthly payments which would gradually and finally amortize the principal debt March, 1927.] HAINES v. COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE Co. 621

with interest and that the point of time at which such debt would be finally absorbed should be considered the maturity date of the whole of such obligation. In other words, respondents seem to declare that the court must forbid the collection of any principal or the declaring of any portion of the principal due until by a process similar to the one above described, the debt would be finally paid in full with interest, were such partial payments provided for made. We can see no reason for any such holding. One thing is true and that is that the note provides that each month a payment to some extent must be made on account of the principal as distinguished from the interest and that such payments on account of principal will increase from month to month. Is it true that, on account of the usury in connection with this item of interest, this obligation to pay part of the principal is also voided? Our answer is "No." A man guilty of usury does not forfeit his goods like a felon at common law. The usury law is to be used as a shield and not as a sword.

We have no hesitancy in holding that in an obligation such as we have before us the full payments called for in the promissory note must be paid in order to prevent default, as well as to prevent acceleration of the maturity date of the remainder of the principal; that, inasmuch as the claim for interest is void, all payments will be referred to the principal and the obligation thus finally extinguished. If default has been or is hereafter made in the payment in full of these installments, the whole of the obligation (without interest) may, at the option of the holder of the note, be declared due and payable. Any other construction would be tantamount to the infliction of a further penalty upon defendants not provided for in the act.

So, also, in this case if the principal obligation is found to be due and on this account, when taken in connection with other charges, it exceeds the amount of the interest paid when trebled, it would be the duty of the court, as above noted, to state the account between the parties and to credit the offset of the interest trebled and generally to dispose of the whole issue presented by the cause. 622 HAINES v. COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE Co. [200 Cal.

Judgment is reversed, with direction to the court below for such further proceedings herein as it may be advised not inconsistent with this opinion.

Shenk, J., Richards, J., Curtis, J., Seawell, J., Waste, C. J., and Langdon, J., concurred.

Rehearing denied, and on April 26, 1927, the court filed the following opinion:

THE COURT.—Petition for rehearing herein is denied.

The subject of usury presents countless legal questions, a great many of which could not possibly be considered germane to the questions involved in this appeal. Some five sets of *amici curiae*, however, have filed briefs and have suggested many questions which the profession desires answered. In so far as those questions are deemed pertinent to the issues of the case before us, we have yielded to their importunities and will undertake to discuss them.

[10] Respondents and also one set of *amici curiae* assert that in this case respondents should have had a sweeping provision in the judgment declaring not only forfeiture of the right to interest with penalties thereto, but also declaring forfeited and uncollectible the entire principal debt. There is not a semblance of merit in this contention.

In the first place, the amended complaint does not aver such a forfeiture, and in the second place the prayer is only to the effect that said sale under said trust deed be enjoined until the "full maturity of said loan" and "that each defendant be enjoined at all times, until the full period of time said loan was contracted for has elapsed, from selling or offering for sale, or exposing for sale, or taking any steps whatsoever to sell or to offer for sale the said premises or any part or portion thereof, or interest therein."

Moreover, even a casual reading of the statute itself shows that the legislative intent was not to declare the whole contract void, but only the portion thereof relating to interest. The language in this connection is as follows: "Any agreement or contract of any nature in conflict with the provisions of this section shall be null and void as to any agreement or stipulation therein contained to pay in- March, 1927.] HAINES v. COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE Co. 623

terest and no action at law to recover interest in any sum shall be maintained and the debt cannot be declared due until the full period of time it was contracted for has elapsed.'' The contention that the principal debt is forfeited is wholly inconsistent with merely deferring the collection of the debt until the full period of time it was contracted for has elapsed. No authority has been cited and none can be found holding the principal debt forfeited under such provision of a statute. The authorities cited by counsel, in so far as applicable at all, are in direct opposition to this contention, for in Jackson v. Shawl, 29 Cal. 267, 272, the court said:

"The plaintiff's promise was to repay to the defendant the sum borrowed in one month, and also to pay him seven per cent per month on the principal sum for its use. Here the contract between the parties was legal as to the principal sum, but illegal as to the interest. The two things were not inseparable. 'When the transaction is of such a nature that the good part of the consideration can be separated from that which is bad, the Courts will make the distinction, for the common law doth divide according to common reason; and having made that void that is against law, lets the rest stand. The general and more liberal principle now is, that when any matter, void even by statute, be mixed up with good matter, which is entirely independent of it, the good part shall stand and the rest be held void.' (2 Kent's Com., 467, and cases cited; DeGroot v. Van Duzer, 20 Wend. (N. Y.) 421; Leavitt v. Palmer, 3 N. Y. 37 [51 Am. Dec. 333]; 1 Parsons Cont., 380.)"

In Innes v. Goldwater, 30 Cal. App. 101, 105 [157 Pac. 18, 19], the court again said: "In the light of this express approval of the principle declared in the case of Jackson v. Shawl, we are constrained to give application to that principle in the case at bar to the extent of holding that the agreement of the plaintiff with the defendant for these several loans and pledges were legal in so far as the principal sum of such loans and security therefor were concerned, and only illegal as to the interest to be charged, and hence that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover the personal property so pledged and made the subject of this 624 HAINES v. COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE CO. [200 Cal.

action without first tendering and offering to repay to the defendant the amount of his original loans."

Of course, if it were impossible to ascertain how much of the sum contained in the note of $34,000 was principal and how much thereof was imputable to interest, there might well be made the contention that inasmuch as some of the transaction was void because prohibited by the statute, all should be so declared, but such is not the fact. The evidence shows without conflict that the item of $1,020 was a three per cent commission, and that the remainder of the sum, to wit, $32,980, was actually delivered to and received by the respondents as principal. The interest is, therefore, clearly severable from the principal. The fact that they are contained in the same instrument is no argument against such a construction and, as above noted, the statute declares only the obligation to pay interest void, but nowhere assails the integrity of the obligation to repay the principal.

[11] It may also be said in passing that the provisions of the act declaring the taking of usury a misdemeanor relate only to the question of interest and bear no relation whatever to the loan or repayment of the principal sum. The fact that the commission of three per cent was construed to be interest made it incumbent upon the court to declare the contract usurious and to carry with it the penalties provided in the statute. Respondents' desires have been whetted and they now want not only what the complaint did not ask, but what the statute does not allow. They desire not only the amount denominated a commission construed as carrying with it the death penalty to the covenant to pay interest, but also the same penalty for the entire principal debt. Indeed, respondents in one stroke desire to receive $32,980 for which they gave nothing in return and in addition to make clear profit of twice the amount of interest paid on account of the transaction. The legislative power has not declared such a result and we must decline to write such a meaning into the statute.

[12] A second set of *amici curiae* contend that as long as the limit of the rate of interest is maintained at twelve per cent per annum, the compounding of the interest, if not paid at the time provided for, should be allowed. This March, 1927.] HAINES v. COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE Co. 625

contention is in the teeth of the statute itself and cannot be maintained.

A third set of *amici curiae* contend that the holding of the court is ambiguous as to the meaning of the maximum rate of interest allowable under the statute. We intended to hold that the maximum rate allowed for loans coming under the act is at the rate of twelve per cent per annum for the full period of the loan, and that within such limit the parties may freely contract in respect thereto, if done in writing.

This means that interest may be compounded, if the maximum rate is not exceeded.

This means, also, that commissions and bonuses may be charged by the lender, but all such charges must, when added to the interest specified and spread over the whole period of forbearance, be kept within the limit set by law.

This means, also, as pointed out above, that at the maximum rate, compounding of the interest is illegal. It also means that at the maximum rate of interest the contract may not provide for interest upon any unpaid installment when due. Such an agreement may be made, but only after the date of maturity of such installment and upon a new consideration.

This means, also, that at the maximum rate no interest may be lawfully collected in advance. It means, also, that if, in other cases, interest is deducted in advance from the amount of the loan that in testing the transaction for usury the principal sum loaned will be held to be the amount of the loan less the interest or commission deducted in advance.

[13] But, notwithstanding all the above, we hold that no legal objection exists to provide in a loan contract that it shall bear the maximum rate of interest, payable at the end of any particular period, such as monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, or annually, during the full period of forbearance, provided, of course, as noted above, that such installments as fall due will be without accruing interest thereon, except upon a new contract and new consideration, but the right to declare the whole obligation due for the nonpayment of such installment or installments of interest when due must be held to exist.

200 Cal.—40 626 HAINES v. COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE CO. [200 Cal.

It should be stated here that on the conclusions above announced the authorities of the various states are in conflict. No state has a statute identical with our own; hence, we have had to rely upon practically an independent construction of the provisions of our statute itself.

[14] Complaint is made, also, of our holding that in the instant case respondents were not required to do equity by tendering the principal sum and such other items, excluding interest, as might be due under the obligation before suit could be maintained in this case. Counsel have overlooked the fact that here the extent of the prayer was to cover two subjects only, to wit: Forfeiture of interest and forfeiture of the right to declare the debt due until the full period of time contracted for had elapsed. As to relief on these grounds, it is not necessary to make any tender whatsoever. The law gives a prayer for such relief a special standing, which is not affected by the rule of equity urged upon us. What may or may not be required in that connection in a suit of a different type need not here be discussed.

Complaint is also made of our language as follows: "... that inasmuch as the claim for interest is void, all payments will be referred to the principal and the obligation thus finally extinguished." The contention is that when taken in connection with other parts of the opinion, this provides for quadruple interest. There is no merit in the claim. The meaning of the phrase is as though the word "future" or "subsequent" were inserted between the words "all" and "payment." This clearly appears from the context from which the quotation is taken.

Complaint is also made of the failure of the court to declare whether or not lawful interest might be collected upon the advances made by appellants to discharge prior liens on the mortgaged property. No reason exists for especially passing upon this proposition, as the court in stating the account will undoubtedly allow interest unless there are some special circumstances making such relief inappropriate. The same may be said of the contention that the court should declare whether the deed of trust should be foreclosed by the court or should be foreclosed under the procedure provided for in the deed itself. There ap- March, 1927.] HAINES v. COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE Co. 627

pears to be no reason why we should anticipate a situation calling for a decision of this question.

Lastly, it is asserted that in holding the paragraph in section 3 of the act, respecting the exception of loans on corporate, municipal, and other public bonds, unconstitutional, and yet sustaining the other provisions of the act, we are doing violence to the previous holdings of the court, of which *Mordecai v. Board of Supervisors*, 183 Cal. 434 [192 Pac. 40], is a conspicuous example. Exactly the opposite is true. We are indorsing the doctrine thereof expressed in the words "... and if those provisions are reasonably separable from the balance of the act, and the purpose of the act and the intention of the legislature will be subserved even with those provisions gone, the balance of the act will stand." We held that section 1 covered all loans, secured and unsecured, and the paragraph declared invalid would, but for the illegal exception thereto, have been merely a repetition of the meaning of or provision already contained in said section 1. This clause was declared invalid by reason of the exception.

If this whole clause passes from the statute as surplusage or extraneous matter, or as void because of an illegal exception, how can it be said that the meaning of section 1 is in anywise affected? By such action we have but clarified the situation and declared the legislative intent without in the slightest degree thwarting it. See in this connection, *Ex parte Schmolke*, 199 Cal. 42 [248 Pac. 244]. *Bacon Service Corp. v. Huss*, 199 Cal. 21 [248 Pac. 235], is not authority for the contention of counsel, but distinctly supports the view here announced.

Each particular statute under interpretation must furnish its own basis for decision upon a question of this character. 628 MELLA v. HOOPER. [200 Cal.

[L. A. No. 8534. In Bank.—March 5, 1927.]

JOE J. MELLA, Respondent, v. GEORGE HOOPER, Appellant.

[1] NEGLIGENCE—PERSONAL INJURIES—COLLISION OF AUTOMOBILE WITH MOTORCYCLE—DAMAGES—WAGES.—In an action to recover damages for personal injuries sustained in a collision between defendant's automobile and plaintiff's motorcycle, based upon the alleged negligence of the defendant, testimony of the plaintiff as to the daily wage he was receiving when injured, and that, but for the injury, he would have been receiving the same amount at the time of the trial, did not prejudice the case of the defendant.

[2] Id.—INSTRUCTIONS—BURDEN OF PROOF.—In such a case an instruction, in effect, that it was incumbent on plaintiff to prove his case to a "moral certainty" was not a correct statement of the law in civil causes, but it was more injurious to the plaintiff than to the defendant; and the fact that the instruction referred only to the burden of proof of the plaintiff, and made no reference to the evidence necessary to establish contributory negligence, did not constitute error.

[3] Id.—ELEMENTS OF DAMAGE—PHYSICAL PAIN AND MENTAL ANXIETY—FUTURE DAMAGE—CONSTRUCTION.—In such a case where the jury was told in effect that it might consider as an element of damage such physical pain and mental anxiety as it found plaintiff suffered, or must necessarily suffer in the future, the contention that the word "necessarily" impliedly conveyed to the jury the court's view that the injury sustained by plaintiff would continue to exist in the future, which was a question to be passed upon by the jury, is without merit.

[4] Id.—FUTURE DAMAGE.—In such a case plaintiff is not limited to damages for past suffering and pain, and the jury has a right to include in its award damages for future pain and suffering certain to result; and an instruction that the jury may consider such injuries as the plaintiff must necessarily suffer is but another way of saying that the jury may consider such injury as will be certain to result.

MELLA v. HOOPER.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County. Elliott Craig, Judge. Affirmed.

The facts are stated in the opinion of the court.

W. I. Gilbert for Appellant.

Albert Sidney Brown for Respondent.

WASTE, C. J.—In this action for personal injuries alleged to have been received by plaintiff through the negligent operation of an automobile used as a taxicab, owned and driven by defendant, the jury awarded plaintiff damages in the sum of five thousand dollars. From the judgment entered on the verdict, defendant appealed.

The accident out of which the injuries arose happened in the space formed by the intersection of Alameda Street and East Third Street, in the city of Los Angeles. At that point a double line of street-car tracks run east and west, which are intersected by tracks of a steam railway running north and south. Gates were operated on the east and west sides of Alameda Street to protect traffic from passing trains. Just prior to the collision, the plaintiff was riding a motorcycle in a northerly direction on the right, or east, side of Alameda Street. Defendant was driving his taxicab easterly along East Third Street. A westerly bound street-car on East Third Street was approaching the intersection. Traffic at the point was congested on both streets, and the gates were down, giving the north and south bound traffic on Alameda Street the right of way. The gates were raised, permitting the east and west bound traffic on East Third Street to move, the street-car and the taxicab approaching each other from opposite directions. An instant before the gates were raised, the plaintiff on his motorcycle and an automobile on his left had entered the intersection and were proceeding northerly across East Third Street. Defendant drove rapidly into the intersection, and the driver of the automobile, seeing the speed at which he was approaching, abruptly stopped his car. The plaintiff's vision being obstructed by the automobile on his left, he proceeded across 630 MELLA v. HOOPER. [200 Cal.
East Third Street and had nearly reached the west-bound street-car track when his motorcycle was struck by the automobile of the defendant. By the impact of the collision plaintiff was thrown on to the fender of the street-car. He suffered a compound fracture of the left leg below the knee and was bruised and cut.

On this appeal the appellant contends, first, that the evidence was insufficient to show that he was guilty of any negligence whatsoever, and, second, conceding that appellant was guilty of negligence, the respondent was guilty of contributory negligence directly contributing to and which was the proximate cause of his injuries. As in most cases in which sudden accidents furnish the cause of action, various inferences and different conclusions may be drawn from the evidence. A number of witnesses testified on each side of this case, explaining their testimony by means of a diagram. The respondent contends that the evidence of physical facts and statements made by the appellant after the accident sustains the contention that the collision was brought about through the undue haste of the defendant to "get to the depot," and in his not allowing sufficient time for the northerly bound traffic to clear the intersection before he attempted to cross Alameda Street. There is evidence, also, to show that he drove into the intersection at an excessive rate of speed. The situation of the parties and the surroundings at the time of the accident were made very clear to the jurors. Their verdict finds ample support in the record of the evidence taken at the trial, both as to the negligence of the appellant and the lack of contributory negligence on the part of the respondent.

[1] Appellant complains of the admission, over his objection, of the testimony of the respondent as to the amount of wages the latter was receiving at the time of the injury. Read as a whole, however, the testimony only showed that respondent was receiving $4.50 a day when he was injured, and that, but for the injury, he would be receiving the same amount at the time of the trial, and did not, in any way, prejudice the case of the appellant.

[2] Complaint is made of the giving of certain instructions. One, given at the request of the plaintiff and which informed the jury, in effect, that it was incumbent on the plaintiff to prove his case to a "moral certainty," was March, 1927.]

MELLA v. HOOPER.

not a correct statement of the law in civil causes (People v. Miller, 171 Cal. 649, 654 [154 Pac. 463]); but it was more injurious to the plaintiff than to the appellant. The concluding portion of the instruction is somewhat garbled and rather meaningless; but the fact that the instruction referred only to the burden of proof of the plaintiff and made no reference to the evidence necessary to establish contributory negligence did not constitute error. If the defendant desired any instructions to be given on the subject of contributory negligence, he should have prepared and submitted them to the court with the request that they be given.

[3] Appellant complains that in one of the instructions the jury was told that it might consider as an element of damages such physical pain and mental anxiety as it found plaintiff suffered, or must necessarily suffer in the future. The contention, in part, is that the word "necessarily" impliedly conveyed to the jury the court's view that the injury sustained by plaintiff would continue to exist in the future, which was a question to be passed upon by the jury. This criticism is without merit. [4] Furthermore, as to the use of the word "necessarily," the statute provides that damages may be awarded in a judicial proceeding for detriment certain to result in the future. (Civ. Code, sec. 3283.) At the time of the trial, the respondent was still suffering pain in his leg, on which there was an open sore which required treatment, and it was painful for him to walk. He was not limited to damages for past suffering and pain, and the jury had a right to include in its award damages for future pain and suffering certain to result. To say that the jury may consider such injury as the plaintiff must necessarily suffer was but another way of saying that the jury may consider such injury as would be certain to result. (Ryan v. Oakland Gas etc. Co., 21 Cal. App. 14, 24 [130 Pac. 693].)

What is said with reference to the exception to the instruction under the ruling and exception just discussed is applicable to the objection here made to an instruction defining and explaining "compensatory damages."

The judgment is affirmed.

[1] PUBLIC OFFICERS—COUNTY SURVEYOR—FIXING SALARY—CONSTITUTIONAL LAW.—Where the compensation of a county surveyor is not fixed at the time of his election, the constitutional provisions prohibiting the increase of the compensation of an officer during his term of office (sec. 9, art. XI, of the constitution) does not prevent the fixing thereof after his term begins.

[2] ID.—COUNTY OFFICERS—COMPENSATION—DELEGATION OF POWER TO FIX—CONSTITUTIONAL LAW.—A county surveyor is a county officer, and in view of the provisions of section 5 of article XI of the constitution, the legislature cannot directly delegate to a board of supervisors the power to fix his compensation.

[3] ID.—REGULATION OF COMPENSATION—CONSTRUCTION OF CONSTITUTION.—The word "regulate," as used in section 5 of article XI of the constitution, has always been deemed to mean "to fix" or "to establish," and no other signification may now properly be attached to that word in the connection in which it is so employed in said section of the constitution.

[4] ID.—SECTION 4044, POLITICAL CODE—CONSTRUCTION.—Although the legislature purported to fix a maximum of ten dollars per day to the compensation that might be fixed by the board of supervisors for a county surveyor under section 4044 of the Political Code, still the section attempts to vest in the board of supervisors the power in its discretion to fix said compensation within the limits specified.

[5] ID.—DELEGATION OF POWERS—SECTION 4044, POLITICAL CODE—INVALIDITY OF.—Section 4044 of the Political Code, in so far as it attempts to delegate to the board of supervisors the power to fix the compensation of the county surveyor, is invalid, or contrary to section 5 of article XI of the constitution.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Superior Court of Contra Costa County. H. V. Alvarado, Judge. Affirmed.

The facts are stated in the opinion of the court.

Archibald B. Tinning, District Attorney, and T. H. De Lap, Deputy District Attorney, for Appellant.

Jones & Dall for Respondent.

SHENK, J.—The respondent, as surveyor of the county of Contra Costa, commenced this proceeding in mandamus in the superior court to compel the appellant, as auditor of said county, to draw his warrant upon the county treasurer in the sum of $500 as salary due the respondent for the month of August, 1924. The appellant answered and the cause was heard on an agreed statement of facts which are set forth in the findings. Judgment was rendered ordering the issuance of a peremptory writ, from which judgment this appeal is prosecuted on the judgment-roll.

The respondent was elected county surveyor at the general election in November, 1918. When he qualified, in January, 1919, Contra Costa County was a county of the sixteenth class, and under subdivision 12 of section 4245 of the Political Code (Stats. 1917, p. 978) his salary was fixed at $3,250 per annum. On July 27, 1919, the County Engineer Act (Stats. 1919, p. 1290) became effective. Pursuant to the provisions of this act the respondent was appointed county engineer and his salary was fixed at $6,000 per annum by the board of supervisors. He received this compensation until the County Engineer Act was, on October 7, 1921, declared unconstitutional (Coulter v. Pool, 187 Cal. 181 [201 Pac. 120]). Under the pro- 634 ARNOLD v. SULLENGER. [200 Cal.

visions of section 11 of said act the office of county surveyor was deemed abolished when the person holding said office should be appointed county engineer. On July 20, 1921, Contra Costa was placed in the thirteenth class (Stats. 1921, p. 850). As the County Engineer Act was then deemed to be valid, no provision was made in the amendment of section 4242 of the Political Code for the salary of county surveyor. After the decision in Coulter v. Pool the respondent drew a salary at the rate of $3,250 per annum under the provisions of section 4245 of the Political Code until the expiration of his term, in January, 1923. At the November election in 1922 the respondent was re-elected county surveyor, and, upon his qualification, took office to succeed himself, in January, 1923. From the commencement of said term until July 31, 1924, the respondent presented claims to the board of supervisors of said county for compensation at the rate of ten dollars per day, and his claims were allowed under the terms of section 4044 of the Political Code, which provided that "the surveyor shall receive such compensation as the board of supervisors may allow, not to exceed ten dollars per day for all work performed." On July 31, 1923, section 4242 of the Political Code was amended, whereby, in subdivision 12 thereof (Stats. 1923, p. 1060), the compensation of the surveyor of counties of the thirteenth class was fixed by the legislature at $6,000 per annum. It is the compensation fixed by the amendment of section 4242 that is claimed by the respondent in this proceeding.

The question for determination is whether section 4044 of the Political Code is unconstitutional in so far as it attempts to vest in the board of supervisors the power and discretion to fix the compensation of the county surveyor at "not to exceed ten dollars per day." If such provision be valid it would follow that the compensation fixed in subdivision 12 of section 4242 of the Political Code, as amended in 1923, at $6,000 per annum would constitute an increase in the compensation of the respondent after his election and during his term of office in contravention of section 9 of article XI of the constitution, for on no theory may it be said that on the face of the statute (Shearer v. Flannery, 68 Cal. App. 91 [228 Pac. 549]) the compensation authorized by section 4044 would in one year be equal to March, 1927.]

ARNOLD v. SULLENGER.

635

$6,000. Compensation at the maximum rate of ten dollars per day for every day in the year would be slightly in excess of one-half of that sum. The conclusive presumption recognized in Galeener v. Honeycutt, 173 Cal. 100 [159 Pac. 595], and cases therein cited, to the effect that the Governor and legislature have investigated, ascertained, and determined that the change does not result in the increase of compensation would therefore have no application in this case. On the other hand, if section 4044, so far as it attempts to delegate to the board of supervisors the power to fix the compensation of the county surveyor, be held to be constitutionally unauthorized, it would then follow that no compensation for the respondent was lawfully fixed at the time of his election or during his term of office until the amendment of section 4242 of the Political Code became effective. When so fixed it would not result in an unconstitutional increase or an increase at all.

[1] When the compensation of the county surveyor is not fixed at the time of his election the constitutional provision does not prevent the fixing thereof after his term begins. (Shearer v. Flannery, supra, and cases therein cited.)

[2] That the respondent is a county officer is not questioned. It is well settled, in view of the provisions of section 5 of article XI of the constitution, that the legislature cannot directly delegate to a board of supervisors the power to fix the compensation of a county officer. (Coulter v. Pool, supra; People v. Wheeler, 136 Cal. 652 [69 Pac. 435]; People v. Johnson, 95 Cal. 471 [31 Pac. 611]; Dougherty v. Austin, 94 Cal. 601 [28 Pac. 834, 29 Pac. 1092]; Sarter v. Siskiyou County, 42 Cal. App. 530 [183 Pac. 852].)

[3] Section 5 of article XI of the constitution provides that the legislature by general and uniform laws shall "regulate the compensation of all such officers," which includes county officers. It is insisted by appellant that the word "regulate" as employed in the constitutional provision should be defined to mean "adjust by rule, method, or established mode; to direct by rule or restriction; to subject to governing principles or laws." An examination of the cases in this state, and particularly those above cited, clearly indicates that the word "regulate" 636 ARNOLD v. SULLENGER. [200 Cal.

has always been deemed to mean "to fix" or "to establish," and no other signification may now properly be attached to that word in the connection in which it is so employed in this section of the constitution. [4] No controlling importance may be attached to the fact that in section 4044 the legislature purported to fix a maximum of ten dollars per day to the compensation that might be fixed by the board of supervisors for the county surveyor. Even so the section attempts to vest in the board of supervisors the power in its discretion to fix said compensation within the limits specified.

Under the fee system it was undoubtedly competent for the legislature to fix the fees that might be charged by certain public officers and authorize them to retain the same as long as the aggregate did not exceed the maximum fixed by statute. Instances of such action are found in the county government acts of earlier years (see *Martin v. Santa Barbara*, 105 Cal. 208 [38 Pac. 687]). In such cases the compensation to which the officer was entitled was fixed by statute, with no power in the board of supervisors to alter the same. Under section 4044 the board of supervisors could, if the provision be valid, fix the compensation of the county surveyor at five or six or any number of dollars per day within the maximum and thus exercise a discretionary power in fixing the compensation for a county officer not authorized by law.

[5] We conclude, therefore, that section 4044 of the Political Code, in so far as it attempts to delegate to the board of supervisors the power to fix the compensation of the county surveyor, is invalid, as contrary to section 5 of article XI of the constitution. [6] When so considered there was no law in force at the time of the election of the respondent which fixed his compensation, and the amendment of section 4242 of the Political Code in 1923, fixing such compensation at $6,000 per annum, did not constitute an increase during his term of office as contemplated by section 9 of article XI of the constitution.

The judgment is affirmed.

[1] PLEADING—DEMURRER—ALLEGATIONS TAKEN AS TRUE.—Upon a general demurrer to a petition for a writ of mandate, the allegations of the petition may be accepted as true.

[2] Id.—SECTION 1617½, POLITICAL CODE—CONSTRUCTION—CONSTITUTIONAL LAW.—By the amendment of 1919 (Stats. 1919, p. 399), to section 1617½ of the Political Code, the legislature not only made the section apply to boards of trustees of any school district, and boards of trustees of union high schools or joint union high school districts, as well as to city boards of education, but struck from its provisions all reference to a daily average attendance; and there is, therefore, nothing in the section itself to support the contention that it is unconstitutional as being special legislation and provides for an arbitrary and discriminatory classification of school districts.

[3] Id.—TITLE OF AMENDING ACT—CONSTRUCTION.—The fact that the title to the act of 1919 amending section 1617½ of the Political Code retains the words "a total average daily attendance exceeding fifty-five thousand," which provision is not contained in the body of the act, does not render it unconstitutional.

[4] Id.—STATUTORY CONSTRUCTION—CONSTITUTIONAL LAW.—While the title of an act may be relied upon in ascertaining the intention of the legislature, where the act itself is ambiguous, the title cannot be used for the purpose of restraining or controlling any positive provision of the act.

[7] ID.—SCHOOL PROPERTY—SECTION 1617½, POLITICAL CODE.—The language of section 1617½ of the Political Code, "upon which no public school is being maintained," with reference to the sale of land of a school district, is broad enough to include a public high school; but the fact that land is under lease to a high school district does not prevent the board of education from entering into a contract to sell the land where the time for delivery of title under the contract is beyond the expiration of the lease.

WASTE, C. J.—The petitioner, Los Angeles City School District, prays for the issuance of a writ of mandate to compel the respondents, as president and secretary, respectively, of the Board of Education of the City of Los Angeles, to execute and sign, on behalf of said board, an agreement of sale of the real property hereinafter referred to. [1] The respondents have filed a general demurrer to the petition, and we may therefore accept the averments of the petitioner as true. Petitioner and the Los Angeles City High School District, separate and distinct legal en- Mar. 1927.] LOS ANGELES CITY SCHOOL DIST. v. ODELL. 639

tities, are governed and controlled by the Board of Education of the City of Los Angeles, as created and provided for in the city charter. Petitioner is the owner of real property situated at the northwest corner of Eighth Street and Grand Avenue in the city of Los Angeles, commonly known as the "Grand Avenue School Site." The Board of Education, by unanimous vote, adopted a resolution authorizing the sale of the property, and the highest bid, that of the Capital Company in the sum of $1,575,539.22, was accepted. An agreement of sale was thereupon prepared and executed by the company, and was presented to the Board of Education, which, by apt resolution, authorized and directed the respondents, as president and secretary, to sign and execute the contract on behalf of the Board. The respondents have refused and decline to sign or execute the agreement of sale, assigning as the reason for such refusal that section 1617½ of the Political Code, purporting to authorize the sale of public school property, is unconstitutional as being special legislation, and on the further ground that the proposed sale is illegal and void for the reason that the Los Angeles City High School District is maintaining a public high school on the property.

[2] In support of their contention that section 1617½ of the Political Code is unconstitutional, respondents assert that the authority given by it to sell public school property is confined to boards of education governing city school and city high school districts having an average daily attendance in excess of fifty-five thousand; and that such classification is arbitrary and discriminatory, and, if given effect, would permit but two school boards, namely, those of the cities of Los Angeles and San Francisco, to sell school property. There is no basis for this contention. As now in force, the section contains no limitation based on average daily attendance. Prior to 1917 boards of school trustees and city boards of education had power to purchase or sell school lands only when directed by a vote of their districts. In that year section 1617½ of the Political Code was enacted. By its terms boards of education or other governing boards in cities and having jurisdiction over both the elementary and high school districts embracing such cities, in which the total number of units of average daily attendance in both such school districts, as 640 LOS ANGELES CITY SCHOOL DIST. v. ODELL. [200 Cal.

shown by the annual report of the county superintendent of schools to the state superintendent of public instruction for the preceding school year, exceeded fifty-five thousand, were authorized to sell or lease for a term not exceeding ninety-nine years any real property belonging to their respective school districts, or high school districts upon which no public school was being maintained. (Stats. 1917, p. 1645.) At the next session of the legislature the section was amended to read, so far as is pertinent here: "1617½. Boards of education, or other governing boards, in cities and having jurisdiction over both the elementary and high school districts embracing such cities, and boards of trustees of any school district and boards of trustees of union high school or joint union high school districts, are hereby authorized to sell or lease for a term not exceeding ninety-nine years, any real property belonging to their respective school districts, or high school districts upon which no public school is being maintained . . . " (Stats. 1919, p. 399.) By the amendment, the legislature not only made the section apply to boards of trustees of any school district, and boards of trustees of union high school or joint union high school districts, as well as to city boards of education, but struck from its provisions all reference to a daily average attendance. There is, therefore, nothing in the section itself on which respondents can base their objection that it is unconstitutional as being special legislation, and provides for an arbitrary and discriminatory classification of school districts.

[3] However, the title of the act amending the section affords some basis for the contention of the respondents, in that it retains the reference to "a total average daily attendance exceeding fifty-five thousand." We have carefully examined the legislative history of Assembly Bill No. 298, introduced January 20, 1919, purporting "to amend Section one thousand six hundred seventeen and one-half of the Political Code." Other than extending its provisions to "boards of trustees of union high school districts" the bill was in the identical language of section 1617½ as originally enacted. It was twice amended in the assembly and once in the senate. By one of these amendments the requirement of, and all reference to, the "total number of units of average daily attendance" was stricken from the Mar. 1927.] LOS ANGELES CITY SCHOOL DIST. v. ODELL. 641

body of the act, but, apparently through inadvertence, was not eliminated from the title. It is, therefore, quite clear that the legislature intended that the provisions of the amendatory act should extend to and include all city school and city high school districts, without regard to the average daily attendance therein. The language in the body of the act being clear and unambiguous, it should not be controlled and restrained by the title thereof. [4] The authorities are numerous to the effect that the title of an act may be relied on in ascertaining the intention of the legislature, where the act itself is ambiguous; but the title "cannot be used for the purpose of restraining or controlling any positive provision of the act." (Flynn v. Abbott, 16 Cal. 359, 366; Barnes v. Jones, 51 Cal. 303, 306; In the Matter of the Boston M. & M. Co., 51 Cal. 624, 626.) There is no ambiguity in the amendatory act of 1919, and its title may not, therefore, be employed to control the plain provisions thereof. [5] It is also settled that a revised act must be construed as a new and original piece of legislation and, if possible, effect must be given to every part thereof. (Donlon v. Jewett, 88 Cal. 530 [26 Pac. 370].) It follows that the "arbitrary classification" complained of by the respondents does not in fact exist, and cannot, therefore, form the basis of a constitutional attack on the statute.

[6] Nor do we think it can be successfully maintained that the amendatory act of 1919 violates section 24 of article IV of the constitution by referring to certain subjects apparently not included nor mentioned in its title. It has been held that numerous provisions having one general object fairly indicated by the title to the act may be united. (Ex parte Liddell, 93 Cal. 633, 636 [29 Pac. 251]; Estate of Wellings, 192 Cal. 506, 519 [221 Pac. 628]; McClure v. Riley, 198 Cal. 23, 26 [243 Pac. 429].) The statute in question was intended to authorize and sanction the sale and leasing of public school property by the enumerated boards, and this purpose is fairly discernible from the title to the act and, in our opinion, all of the provisions need not have been set forth in the title. It is not necessary that the title of an act should embrace an abstract of its contents. (Abeel v. Clark, 84 Cal. 226 [24 Pac. 383].) Moreover, it has been held that an act entitled an act to amend a particular section of one of the codes sufficiently

200 Cal.—41 642 LOS ANGELES CITY SCHOOL DIST. v. ODELL. [200 Cal.

states the subject of the act. (People v. Oates, 142 Cal. 12, 14 [75 Pac. 337]; Estate of Elliott, 165 Cal. 339, 345 [132 Pac. 439].) The almost universal custom of the legislature in making amendments to the codes has been to put into the title of the amendatory act, after the number of the section amended and the name of the code, additional words expressing the subject of the act; and it is well settled that such amendatory act complies with the constitutional requirement. (23 Cal. Jur., p. 661, sec. 54.) That portion of the title of the amendatory act of 1919 which reads, "An act to amend section one thousand six hundred seventeen and one-half of the Political Code," adequately expresses the intention of the legislature, which was to supersede the previous legislation upon the subject. It cannot be said that the provisions of the act are in excess of the title. From the foregoing it follows that section 1617½ of the Political Code, as amended in 1919, is not subject to any of the constitutional objections urged.

[7] The further objection of the respondents to authenticating the agreement of sale is based on the contention that, at the time its execution was directed by the Board of Education, a public school was being maintained on the property. The fact is that although no elementary school was being conducted on the Grand Avenue school site by the petitioner, it had been occupied by the Los Angeles City High School District for more than three years for high school purposes, under an annual rental agreement with petitioner, and, at the time of the negotiations between petitioner and the Capital Company, a public high school was being maintained on the property. The section (1617½, supra) authorizes the sale of property belonging to school districts "upon which no public school is being maintained." It is contended by respondents that the maintenance of any public school on the real property sought to be transferred is sufficient to preclude a sale thereof under the code section, and that, inasmuch as the Los Angeles City High School District is maintaining a public school on the property under the lease from the petitioner, the contemplated sale is illegal. In reply to this contention, petitioner urges that it has abandoned the property as a school site, and is not now using it for such purpose; and, furthermore, that the provisions of Mar. 1927.] LOS ANGELES CITY SCHOOL DIST. v. ODELL. 643

section 1617½ preclude a sale of public school property only when the district which owns the same is maintaining a public school thereon.

The language "upon which no public school is being maintained" is broad enough to include a public high school. (Const., art. IX, sec. 6; Pol. Code, secs. 1663, 1720; Chico High School Board v. Board of Supervisors, 118 Cal. 115 [50 Pac. 275].) The decision in Richey v. Corralitos Union School Dist., 67 Cal. App. 708 [228 Pac. 348], lends support to the contention of the petitioner that it has abandoned the school site for school purposes, and as the occupancy for high school purposes was by another school district, it cannot be said that the property is being used for school purposes within the intent of section 1617½, supra, but we deem it unnecessary to pursue that subject further, for the admitted fact is that the lease of the property by petitioner to the Los Angeles City High School District expired and terminated prior to the date contemplated in the agreement of sale on which title to and possession of the property were to be delivered to the purchaser. At the time contemplated for such delivery of title and possession the school site was not used or occupied by either the Los Angeles City School District or the Los Angeles City High School District for any school purpose whatever. The respondents contend that notwithstanding the deferred date for the delivery of title and possession, the entire equitable title to the property would have vested in the purchasers upon the execution and delivery of the agreement of sale, and that the Los Angeles City School District would thereafter possess nothing more than the legal title to the property. That is no doubt true. (Keese v. Beardsley, 190 Cal. 465, 473 [26 A. L. R. 1538, 213 Pac. 500]; Orange Cove Water Co. v. Sampson, 78 Cal. App. 334 [248 Pac. 526].) But no authorities have been cited to us which would tend to support the theory of the respondents that the School District may not enter into negotiations for the sale of the property as was done in the present case, the delivery of title and possession to take place at some deferred date. It is not contended here that the proceedings looking to the sale of the Grand Avenue school site were in any way irregular or that the price agreed to be paid by the purchasers of the property was in any way in- 644 JOHNSTON v. FIELD. [200 Cal.

adequate, or that any colorable circumstance attached to the sale of the property.

We are, therefore, of the view that no sufficient reason has been shown by the respondents why they should not execute the agreement of sale as directed and authorized by the resolution of the Board of Education acting for the Los Angeles City School District, the owner of the property.

Let a writ of mandate issue directing the respondents to execute and deliver the agreement of sale as prayed for.

RICHARDS, J.—This is an appeal from a judgment of the superior court in and for the county of Orange in favor of the plaintiffs in an action brought by them to March, 1927.]

JOHNSTON v. FIELD.

set aside a deed executed by one Eva Jeanette Shaffer, since deceased, on the fourth day of April, 1922, by which deed she purported to transfer to the defendants and appellants certain real property constituting practically the whole of her estate. The alleged grounds upon which the plaintiffs sought to have said conveyance set aside were that the same was obtained by said grantees by fraud and undue influence and that the same was without consideration and was never in fact delivered by said grantor to the grantees named therein. The cause was tried by the court, sitting without a jury, at the conclusion of which trial the court made its findings of fact and conclusions of law wherein the averments of the plaintiffs were sustained and the said conveyance avoided. The sole contention of the appellants is that the findings of the trial court in the foregoing regard were insufficiently supported by the evidence. Practically the entire brief of the appellants, consisting of eighty printed pages, is devoted to a review of the evidence in the case. The brief of the respondents is also largely made up of a similar recital of the evidence which, it is claimed, sustains the findings and conclusions of the trial court. We are thus brought to an examination of the entire record, with a view to determining whether, upon the several issues presented at the trial, the evidence is so far conflicting that we ought not to disturb the findings and judgment of the trial court. We are satisfied from such a review that such is the case. The grantor of the deed in question was an infirm old woman, of whom the plaintiffs and defendants are her children by two marriages and constitute her only heirs. At the time of her death she was of the age of seventy-five years, and during the several days preceding her death, and during the course of which the conveyance in question was made, was in a dying condition, and was so known to be, not only by her said children, but also by the physicians who were in attendance upon her during said period. It would be useless to attempt to review in detail the testimony of her said children and of her said physicians in order to point out the sharply conflicting evidence given by these witnesses as to the mental and physical condition of the grantor of this conveyance during these several days preceding her decease. [1] We shall not, there- 646 ESTATE OF O'CONNOR. [200 Cal.
fore, attempt such review, but will merely state it to be our fixed conclusion that the case presents such a conflict in the evidence that the judgment of the trial judge who, acting impartially, and after seeing the parties and hearing the evidence in the case, reached the conclusion that the conveyance ought not to stand, should be upheld.
The judgment is affirmed.

In the Matter of the Estate of MARY ESTHER O'CONNOR, Deceased.

[1] ESTATES OF DECEASED PERSONS — APPEAL FROM DECREE OF DISTRIBUTION — SUFFICIENCY OF NOTICE.—Although the language in a notice of appeal from a decree of distribution in the estate of a deceased person is confusing, where it correctly designates the date of the decree and the date of its entry and an amendment thereto, no other decree being entered in the matter, the notice sufficiently identifies the decree and is sufficient.

[2] ID.—FINAL ACCOUNT—EVIDENCE.—Upon the settlement of a final account in the estate of a deceased person, it is error to allow an item which exceeds twenty dollars where there is no voucher to support the item and there is no basis of the approval of the item except an unverified statement of counsel.

[3] ID.—PAYMENT OF TAXES AND ASSESSMENTS.—Taxes and street assessments which are past due liens upon the property of the estate of a deceased person in course of administration are properly payable by the executor in the care and management of the estate; and the fact that such taxes and assessments are upon land devised to the executor should not deprive him of the right.

[4] ID.—EXECUTOR AND ATTORNEY—ALLOWANCE FOR LOSS.—The executor of the estate of a deceased person should be given credit in his final account for a loss shown upon re-appraisement of the property, but this item should not be included in the aggregate upon which the compensation of himself and his attorney is computed.

1. See 2 Cal. Jur. 318.
3. See 12 Cal. Jur. 113. March, 1927.]

ESTATE OF O'CONNOR.

[5] Id.—POSSESSION OF ESTATE—PRESUMPTION—WAGES FOR COMPENSATION.—The statute requires the executor of the estate of a deceased person to take into possession all the estate of the testator, both real and personal, and in the absence of a showing to the contrary, it will be presumed that the executor has complied with the statutory requirements and compensation should be allowed both the executor and his attorney based upon such property, as shown by the inventory and appraisement.

[6] Id.—DISTRIBUTION—GAS AND OIL RIGHTS.—Where a codicil to a will devises a certain percentage of gas and oil rights to certain devices, objection to their distribution upon the ground that all hope or expectation of oil or gas production from said property has been abandoned and such distribution will constitute a cloud upon the title is untenable.

[7] Id.—COMPENSATION OF EXECUTOR AND ATTORNEY—EXTRAORDINARY SERVICES—DISCRETION.—Under sections 1618 and 1619 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the probate court has the discretion to allow compensation to the executor and his attorney for extraordinary services in securing a loan with which to pay debts of the estate.

APPEAL from an order of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County overruling exceptions to the final account of an executor and from the decree of distribution. W. H. Thomas, Judge pro tem. Motion to dismiss appeal denied. Decree reversed.

The facts are stated in the opinion of the court.

Lee Utley for Petitioner.

James Donovan and Edgar L. Bishop for Residuary Legatee and Objector.

SHENK, J.—Mary Esther O'Connor died testate in the county of Los Angeles. Her will, including a codicil, was admitted to probate. Both in the will and codicil Lucy J. Hartman, a sister of the decedent, was made residuary

5. See 11 Cal. Jur. 1176. 648 ESTATE OF O'CONNOR. [200 Cal.
legatee. In the codicil Charles F. Bailey, the respondent herein, was devised a lot at the corner of Figueroa and Sixty-seventh Streets, in the city of Los Angeles, and he was also made sole executor without bond. Certain property belonging to the estate and located at Los Nietos had been appraised at $15,000, based to a large extent on its probable oil and gas indications. This property was later re-appraised at $6,500. The administration proceeded to a consideration of an amended final account and petition for distribution, which came on regularly for hearing. Exceptions to certain items of the account and objection to distribution according to the terms of the codicil were filed by the residuary legatee and were overruled. The court thereupon entered its order settling the final account and rendered its decree of distribution. In the decree the court recited that "after hearing the evidence at such time" the court arrived at the determination therein set forth. The residuary legatee made a motion to strike out the quoted phrase on the ground that no evidence had been taken. The motion was granted, and in lieu of the words stricken the court inserted the following: "on taking up the first objection of counsel for objector, Lucy J. Hartman, Mr. Lee Utley, attorney for the executor in said matter, arose and stated in open court that the item amounting to Fifty-five ($55.00) Dollars was the sum total of several items, none of which amounted to Twenty ($20.00) Dollars, and did not present any vouchers for any of said items amounting in the aggregate to said sum total. That there was no objection made to such statement and the court accepted said statement as a fact and then overruled the said objection; as to the five remaining objections to the Final Account of the executor no evidence of any kind was offered or received at the time, and in arriving at its final conclusions the court considered only said objection to the Amended Final Account, the Amended Final Account itself and other documents and papers among the files on file in the above entitled action." The decree of distribution was dated May 12, 1926, and was entered on June 11, 1926. The order amending the recital in the decree was made and filed June 17, 1926. The residuary legatee served and filed a notice of appeal from both the order overruling her exceptions to the final account and March, 1927.]

ESTATE OF O'CONNOR.

also from the decree dated May 12th and entered June 11th, as amended June 17, 1926, reciting said dates in the notice. [1] The respondent made a motion in this court to dismiss the appeal on the ground that the notice of appeal was insufficient to vest appellate jurisdiction. On the hearing of said motion it was insisted that the said notice of appeal applied solely to the order overruling the objections and that such an order is not appealable under section 963 of the Code of Civil Procedure. If the notice of appeal were so limited there would be no recourse but to dismiss the appeal, for it is clear that an order overruling exceptions to a final account is not an appealable order. But when the notice of appeal is analyzed and the surplusage discarded it may fairly be said to constitute a notice of appeal from the decree of distribution. It gave notice of appeal from said decree, designating correctly its date and the date of its entry and amendment, and there was no other decree entered in the matter. While the language of the notice is somewhat confusing, it sufficiently identifies the decree from which the appeal was intended to be taken and the respondent was not misled thereby (Harreldson v. Miller & Lux, Inc., 182 Cal. 414 [188 Pac. 800]; 2 Cal. Jur., p. 318). The motion to dismiss the appeal was continued for determination preliminarily to the consideration of the appeal on its merits. From what has been said it follows that the motion should be denied.

[2] On the merits the appellant urges six points for reversal. The first point is that the court erroneously approved an item of $55 for money expended in administering upon certain property of the estate in Spokane. There was no voucher for this item, and it is insisted that it should be excluded for the reason that it represents an expenditure of over $20 (sec. 1632, Code Civ. Proc.). As indicated in the order of the court above quoted the basis for the approval of the item without vouchers was a statement by counsel for respondent in open court, not under oath, that the item was an aggregate of smaller items of less than $20 each. There was no evidence in support of the fact of payment of this item, nor does the verified account state to whom payment was made. The item should therefore have been rejected. (Sec. 1632, Code Civ. Proc.; Estate of Hedrick, 127 Cal. 184 [59 Pac. 590].) 650 ESTATE OF O'CONNOR. [200 Cal.
[3] The second objection relates to taxes and street assessments paid by the executor on the Figueroa Street lot. The court allowed credit to the executor for the payment thereof. It is the contention of the appellant that taxes are a charge against the land, and not the estate, and that certain assessments paid by the executor were not personal claims against the testatrix, but against the land. It is also claimed that as the executor is to receive this particular lot on distribution, he should not receive credit for these payments. A portion of the taxes were levied prior to the death of the testatrix and the whole thereof were due when paid. The assessments were annual payments on a street bond which were paid as they became due during the course of administration. Although the lot had been devised to the executor it was and continued to be a part of the assets of the estate until distribution. The title of the devisee was at all times subject to be divested if the estate became insolvent. The taxes and assessments were past due liens upon the property of the estate in course of administration and were properly payable by the executor in the care and management of the estate (People v. Olvera, 43 Cal. 492; Weinreich v. Hensley, 121 Cal. 647, 657 [54 Pac. 254]; Estate of Freud, 131 Cal. 667 [82 Am. St. Rep. 407, 63 Pac. 1080]; 12 Cal. Jur., p. 113).

[4] The third and fourth exceptions are addressed to the allowance of compensation to the executor and his attorney. The compensation was computed upon the re-appraised value of the estate, including a realization loss of $100. The executor was properly given credit for this loss, but the item should not have been included in the aggregate upon which the compensation of himself and his attorney was computed (sec. 1618, Code Civ. Proc.; Estate of Fernandez, 119 Cal. 570, 585 [51 Pac. 851]). [5] It is insisted that neither the executor nor his attorney is entitled to a commission on the value of the Figueroa Street lot devised to the executor "unless the same was taken into possession for the purpose of administration." The statute requires the executor to take into possession all the estate of the testator, both real and personal (sec. 1581, Code Civ. Proc.), and in the absence of a showing to the contrary, and none is here shown, it will be presumed that the executor has complied with the statutory requirement. The in- March, 1927.] ESTATE OF O'CONNOR. 651

ventory and appraisement and the account show the lot as part of the assets of the estate. The objection that compensation should not be allowed to both the executor and his attorney is without merit (sec. 1618, Code Civ. Proc.; 11 Cal. Jur. 1176).

[6] The fifth objection is to the distribution of the one per cent gas and oil rights made in the codicil to certain devisees, on the ground that all hope or expectation of oil or gas production from said property has been abandoned and such distribution will constitute a cloud upon the title. No evidence was offered and no authority has been cited to sustain the contention. The dispositive language of the codicil was authority for the order and the point is untenable.

[7] The sixth exception is to the allowance of $75 to the attorney and $50 to the executor for extraordinary services in securing a loan of $2,500 with which to pay debts of the estate. Sections 1618 and 1619 of the Code of Civil Procedure permit the court in its discretion to make such allowances, and it does not appear that the court has improperly exercised such discretion.

The motion to dismiss the appeal is denied. The decree is reversed, with direction to the trial court to disallow the said item of $55 and to not include the said item of $100 in the amount upon which the compensation of the executor and his attorney is computed, the costs of this appeal to be paid out of the assets of said estate.

The facts are stated in the opinion of the court.

E. M. Torchia and C. W. Pendleton for Appellant.

Clyde W. Smith for Respondent.

THE COURT.—Motion to stay appellant's appeal. The action was one for divorce, wherein the plaintiff obtained an interlocutory decree of divorce, which included a judgment or order for a division of the community property between the parties. The community property consisted of certain real estate, and also of a gasoline launch partly owned by the defendant and which was the source of his livelihood as a fisherman. The order also provided for the payment of the sum of $50 per month for the support of the minor children of the parties, and further provided for the payment of $250 as plaintiff's counsel fees, and also for her costs of suit. The defendant began and has since continued to make the monthly payment for the support of his minor children as required by said order. He has also paid a sum of money which would satisfy the plaintiff's demand

for costs. He has not, however, paid the amount of the counsel fees as provided in the original order. The defendant has appealed from said interlocutory decree. Upon taking said appeal the appellant was cited by the superior court to show cause why he should not be punished for contempt in failing to obey the order of the court relating to the payment of counsel fees. The record discloses that upon the hearing of said citation the trial court dismissed the contempt proceedings. [1] The record further shows that the court upon the showing that such appeal had been taken ordered the appellant to pay an additional sum of $250 for the payment of counsel fees upon said appeal. So far as this record discloses the plaintiff has made no further effort to enforce said orders for the payment of counsel fees, either by execution or by any further proceedings in contempt. She, however, appears in this court with a further motion to stay the appellant's appeal until he shall have complied with said orders. In support of her motion she presents an affidavit which merely shows that the defendant has not obeyed said orders or either of them, but which fails to show either that the appellant is able to comply with said orders or that she herself is not able to provide herself with and to pay counsel to represent her upon said appeal. The record upon the trial of the cause shows that the only property which the defendant was permitted to retain was his interest in his gasoline launch, his earnings by means of which as a fisherman being uncertain, and at best little more than sufficient to enable him each month to make the payment required for the support of his children. There has been no showing made here that he has any further ability to comply with the orders of the trial court with relation to his payment of his wife's counsel fees upon the trial and upon appeal. In the presence of the foregoing facts we are of the opinion that the respondent has made an insufficient showing for an order herein staying the hearing upon this appeal.

The motion is denied. 654

In the Matter of the Estate of ELMER LEON SMITH, Deceased. EDITH SMITH, Respondent, v. ELLA P. SMITH et al., Appellants.

[1] DIVORCE—SUPPORT OF MINOR CHILD—LIEN—CONSTRUCTION OF DECREE.—In an action for divorce, where the court ordered a deed of trust owned by the defendant (which the latter had deposited with a bank and had given an order to the bank to pay the amounts falling due thereon to the minor child of the parties) to be held for security for the payment of certain amounts provided in the interlocutory decree to be paid to the wife for the support of said child, the order created a lien on the indebtedness secured by the trust deed; and where it appears that the full amount unpaid under said trust deed will be necessary for a compliance with said order during the minority of said child, the lien takes priority over a subsequent order of the probate court setting aside the property to the widow of the deceased under section 1469 of the Code of Civil Procedure.

[2] Id.—SECURITY FOR PAYMENT OF SUPPORT—SECTION 140, CIVIL CODE—POWER OF COURT.—Under section 140 of the Civil Code the court has power in an action for divorce to require the husband to give reasonable security for the payment of money ordered by the court.

[3] Id.—ORDER FOR SUPPORT OF MINOR CHILD—CONTINUANCE AFTER DEATH OF PARENT.—Where the court in an action for divorce orders the husband to pay a certain amount to the wife for support of their minor child during minority, and imposes a lien upon the property of the husband as security for the payment, the order remains in force after the death of the husband during the minority of the child or until the order is modified by the court.

[4] Id.—ORDER SETTING ASIDE WHOLE ESTATE TO WIDOW—JURISDICTION.—An order in probate setting aside all the property of the estate of a decedent to the widow cannot be construed as an order modifying an interlocutory decree of divorce against the decedent which ordered payment by the latter to his wife of a certain amount for the support of their minor child and imposed a lien upon certain property as security for such payment, as the probate

APPEAL from an order of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County. Sidney N. Reeve, Judge. Reversed.

The facts are stated in the opinion of the court.

Walters & Mauk for Appellants.

Wood, Janeway & Pratt and Roland T. Kinny for Respondent.

CURTIS, J.—On June 26, 1924, an interlocutory decree of divorce was entered in favor of Ella P. Smith and against Elmer L. Smith in the superior court of the county of Los Angeles. In this interlocutory decree it was provided that the defendant, Elmer L. Smith, should pay to plaintiff for the support of their minor child, Rhea Smith, the sum of $50 per month. Thereafter, the defendant being in arrears in said payments, the plaintiff in said divorce action filed an application in said superior court by which, we assume from the brief reference thereto in the record herein, plaintiff sought to have the defendant adjudged guilty of contempt of court for failure to comply with said order directing him to pay said sum of $50 per month toward the support of his minor child. Upon the hearing of this application it was found that defendant was in arrears in said payments in the sum of $181. The court also found that some time prior thereto the defendant had deposited with the Walnut Park Bank in said county a trust deed executed by Gilbert Patterson to said defendant; that said trust deed "called for the sum of $1200, payable $30 a month, together with interest," and that said defendant had deposited said trust deed in said bank and said bank held the same for the defendant with an order signed by the defendant to pay to the said Rhea Smith the monthly payments thereof with interest. Thereupon the court made an order as follows: 656 ESTATE OF SMITH. [200 Cal.
"That in order to secure the payments of said installments, as provided for in said interlocutory decree, the court do order that the said Walnut Park Bank aforesaid, be and they are hereby required to hold said trust deed for the security and payment of said support for the said child, Rhea Smith, and that said bank is ordered not to deliver over the said trust deed to the defendant, Elmer L. Smith, or any person for him, but to hold the same and receive the payments together with interest thereon from time to time and pay the same to the said Rhea Smith, taking her receipt therefor, and to hold said trust deed until the further order of the court." The date of this order was April 6, 1925. On September 30, 1925, the defendant died without said order ever having been revoked or modified. Thereafter Edith Smith, with whom said defendant had contracted a second marriage, after being divorced from the said Ella P. Smith, was, by the probate court of said county of Los Angeles, appointed executrix of his last will, and on June 18, 1926, she filed in said probate court her petition under section 1469 of the Code of Civil Procedure to have the whole of the estate of said deceased set aside to her upon the ground that the value thereof did not exceed the sum of $2,500. In this petition it was alleged that the only property left by said decedent was said trust deed, upon which there was then unpaid the sum of $1,000, payable at the rate of $30 per month. The said Ella P. Smith and her minor daughter, Rhea Smith, appeared in said proceeding and filed written objections to the granting of said petition on the ground that by virtue of the order of court of date April 6, 1925, made in the divorce action, there was created a lien against said property in their favor to secure the amounts ordered by the court to be paid by the defendant for the support of said minor child. It appears from said written objections that there was due and unpaid from decedent at the date of his death something over $400 for the support of said minor; that said minor would be sixteen years of age on March 26, 1926, and that the whole amount of indebtedness secured by said trust deed would be required to meet the payments then due and which would become due for the support of said Rhea Smith during her minority. The matter was submitted to the trial court on an agreed statement of facts in which it was stipulated that the amount March, 1927.]                                                                 Esate of Smith.                                                                 657

due for the support of said minor was at the death of decedent the sum of $426; that said minor would be sixteen years of age on March 26, 1926; that the $1,000 indebtedness secured by the trust deed then in the possession of the Walnut Park Bank constituted all the assets of the estate of Elmer L. Smith, deceased, otherwise known as Elmer Leon Smith; "that the monies and assets sought to be set apart to the widow in said application are the monies and assets of the trust deed and notes set forth in said order" of April 6, 1925, and that the decree directing said Elmer L. Smith to pay for the support of his minor child, Rhea Smith, the sum of $50 per month had never been modified. Upon this state of facts the probate court made its decree setting aside to the said Edith Smith, as the surviving widow of said deceased, all the property of said estate and directed the said bank to pay over to her all of the estate of said Elmer Leon Smith, deceased, in its possession, including the indebtedness secured by said deed of trust, and all proceeds thereof in its possession or to be in its possession thereafter. From this order Ella P. Smith and Rhea Smith have appealed. No exception appears to have been made either in the lower court or in this court to the appearance or participation as a party to this proceeding of Rhea Smith, a minor. It is apparent that said minor is without any right to appear herein, both on account of her minority and for the further reason that the order for her support ran in favor of her mother, Ella P. Smith, and not in favor of the minor. However, as the mother, Ella P. Smith, has appeared jointly with the minor in all matters herein, and as her appearance and participation herein is sufficient to protect all the interests involved, we will consider said contest as properly made and presented by her.

[1] The sole question presented on this appeal is whether a lien was created on the indebtedness secured by the trust deed in the possession of the Walnut Park Bank by the order of court made on the sixth day of April, 1925. Appellant, Ella P. Smith, and we will hereafter refer to her as the sole appellant herein, contends that such a lien was created in her favor. The sole contention made by respondent to support the order appealed from is that no lien was created in favor of appellant by said order of court and therefore the subsequent order of the probate court setting aside this

200 Cal.—42 658 ESTATE OF SMITH. [200 Cal.
property to the surviving widow was valid and should be sustained. [2] Respondent concedes the power of the court under section 140 of the Civil Code to require the husband to give reasonable security for the payment of money ordered by the court for the support of his minor child and to impose a lien upon his property to secure the payment of the amounts ordered. She further concedes that this may be done in various ways, one of which may be by the appointment of a receiver. She then contends that no receiver was appointed in this instance. It may be conceded that the order of the court cannot be construed as appointing the Walnut Park Bank a receiver for the purpose of holding the trust deed and applying the payments thereon to the support of the minor, but the appointment of a receiver is only one of the methods which the court may employ to compel obedience to its orders. She then insists that the order requiring the bank to hold the trust deed for security and to pay the proceeds therefrom to his minor child created no lien upon the property, but is "merely a personal order in the nature of an injunction and was not an order in rem." We are unable to follow respondent's reasoning. "A lien is a charge imposed in some mode other than by a transfer in trust upon specific property by which it is made security for the performance of an act." (Civ. Code, sec. 2872.) The order of court of date of April 6, 1925, expressly provides "in order to secure the payments of said installments, as provided for in said interlocutory decree, the court do order that the said Walnut Park Bank aforesaid, be and they are hereby required to hold said trust deed for the security and payment of said support for the said child, Rhea Smith, . . . " This is a direct charge imposed by order of court upon the property therein described to secure the performance of certain acts enumerated in said order. It was unquestionably within the power of the court under said section 140 of the Civil Code to make said order, and it is just as certain that by such order the court created a lien against the property in the hands of the bank to secure the payment of the amounts due and to become due for the maintenance of the minor. It is true that said order further directed the bank not to deliver the trust deed to Elmer L. Smith, the father of said minor, or to any other person, but to hold the same and to receive payments thereof and to pay March, 1927.] ESTATE OF SMITH. 659

them to said Rhea Smith, but this further order instead of detracting from the previous portion thereof, only confirmed and strengthened it. In our opinion there is no question but that by the order of the court a lien was created on the securities in the hands of the bank in favor of said Ella P. Smith.

[3] As to the amount of said lien, as already noted, the court found that at the death of said deceased there was due from him $426 for the support of his said minor child. Respondent, however, concedes that the liability of a father for the support of his minor child is not extinguished by his death, but that his said estate is liable for said support. She contends, however, that by the decree of divorce, in which the minor was awarded to the custody of the mother, the father was under no legal obligation to provide support for said child beyond that which may be directed by the court which has granted the divorce either in its decree or by subsequent modification. Even were this the correct rule, it has no application to the present proceeding as we have here an order of court directing the father to pay for the support of his minor child during her minority. Had the father lived, this order would have continued in force during the minority of his child unless modified by the court. No modification of the order has been made. The question, therefore, is, Does this order continue in force after his death? This question seems never to have been before the appellate courts of this state. Its solution, however, does not appear difficult. The purpose of the order was to maintain the child during her minority and to compel such maintenance by the father. The necessity for the support of the minor is the same, whether the father be alive or dead. Having made provision for the support of the minor, which is at least partially adequate for her maintenance during her minority, is there any reason whatever why this support should cease on the death of the father, leaving property properly applicable for the payment of said support? No reason has been suggested to us and we know of none. Surely no obligation can exceed in importance that which the father owes to his own offspring. It is true he assumed additional duties upon contracting a second marriage, but these are subordinate to those which he owed prior to his said marriage to support his own children. 660 ESTATE OF SMITH. [200 Cal.

In other jurisdictions it has been held that the provision in a decree of divorce directing the father to pay certain amounts toward the support of his minor child is not discharged by his death (Croyts v. Croyts, 143 Mich. 375 [114 Am. St. Rep. 656, 106 N. W. 1111]; Miller v. Miller, 64 Me. 484; Stone v. Bayley, 75 Wash. 184 [48 L. R. A. (N. S.), 429, 134 Pac. 820]; Mansfield v. Hill, 56 Or. 400 [107 Pac. 471, 108 Pac. 1007]; Murphy v. Moyle, 17 Utah, 113 [70 Am. St. Rep. 767, 53 Pac. 1010]). In the last-mentioned case the facts were somewhat similar to those in the present proceeding. A divorce had been granted to the mother and the custody of the minor awarded to her, with the provision in the decree that the father pay to the mother a certain sum monthly toward the support of the minor. The decree further provided that as security for the payment of said amount for the support of the minor the mother was given a lien upon certain real property owned by the father. The father died while his said child was in her minority. The wife filed a claim against his estate for the child's support up to the time when the child should become of age. The trial court gave judgment in her favor for the full amount prayed for and directed that said amount be paid to the clerk of the court to be by him paid to the mother in accordance with the terms of the decree of divorce. It further directed a sale of the property given as security and if the proceeds thereof were not sufficient to pay the amount due under said decree, that the estate of the father should be liable for the balance. Upon appeal the supreme court of Utah affirmed the judgment and stated that the decree of divorce "created an obligation to pay and a lien on the property described in the modified decree as security for payment in accordance with the terms of the decrees, which obligation and lien continued in force after the death of the deceased and bound his estate. Such lien was subject to foreclosure for failure to make payment of the sum stipulated at any time during the minority of the child." The court further held that "The court had the right to enforce the former decrees, and foreclose the lien upon failure of payment; and its failure to do so was not affected by the death of the testate, and, if the proceeds shall be insufficient to satisfy the claim, it may enforce payment of the balance out of the estate." Replying to appellant's contention for a contrary March, 1927.] ALLYNE v. SUPERIOR COURT. 661

ruling the court said: "It is unsound, as being at variance not only with the decrees of the court and the law, but also with justice for it is the solemn duty of every husband and father to support his wife during life, and his children during their minority, suitably to their station in life, and, if he fails to do so, every principle of justice demands that they be thus supported out of his estate."

Our conclusion, therefore, is that appellant has a lien upon the funds secured by the trust deed in the possession of the Walnut Park Bank to secure the payment not only of the amount due for the support of the minor at the death of the father, but for such additional amounts as may accrue in accordance with the interlocutory decree during the minority of said Rhea Smith, or until said decree is modified by the court in which it is granted. [4] The further contention of respondent that the order appealed from may be treated as an order modifying the decree giving a lien upon the trust deed is without merit. The order appealed from was made by the probate court and such court has no jurisdiction over divorce proceedings, and, consequently, was without power to modify any order or decree rendered in a divorce action.

The order appealed from is reversed, with directions to the probate court to enter its order in accordance with the views expressed herein.

[1] DISMISSAL—DELAY IN BRINGING ACTION TO TRIAL—SECTION 583, CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE—CONSTRUCTION.—The mandatory provisions of section 583 of the Code of Civil Procedure do not require the dismissal of an action which has not been brought to trial within five years after the granting of a motion for a new trial. 662 ALLYNE v. SUPERIOR COURT. [200 Cal.

[2] Id.—APPLICATION OF SECTION 583, CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE.—The plain and obvious purpose of section 583 of the Code of Civil Procedure is to regulate the matter of compulsory dismissals only under one set of circumstances, to wit, where an answer has been filed and the action has not been brought to trial within five years thereafter, other sections in the same chapter of the code providing for dismissals under other circumstances; and if none of said sections pertaining to dismissals cover a particular case where more than five years have elapsed since the entry of an order granting a new trial, it is the duty of the trial judge to determine the question as to the reasonableness of the delay, and his determination cannot be disturbed by an appellate court.

[3] Id.—MANDAMUS—PETITION.—The petition for a writ of mandate must state specific facts sufficient to justify the granting of relief sought, and make a clear *prima facie* case to warrant the alternative writ; and in a proceeding in *mandamus* to compel the superior court to dismiss a certain action upon the ground that it has not been brought to trial within five years after the granting of a motion for a new trial, the petition is insufficient to warrant the relief asked where it is framed on the theory that there is a mandatory duty upon the trial court to dismiss the action under section 583 of the Code of Civil Procedure, since no such duty exists and it does not allege facts sufficient to show that the trial court abused the discretion which it had in the matter.

SEAWELL, J.—Petition for writ of mandate to be directed to the respondent Superior Court in and for the City and County of San Francisco and to the Honorable Frank J. Murasky, Judge in Department No. 2 of said respondent court, commanding a dismissal of a certain action heretofore commenced in said court. [1] The principal question involved is whether the mandatory provisions of section 583 of the Code of Civil Procedure require the dismissal of an action which has not been brought to trial within five years after the granting of a motion for a new trial. We are of the opinion that neither section 583 nor any other section of the code compels a trial judge to dismiss an action under such circumstances.

The facts of the case, as they appear in the petition for the writ, are: Petitioners and one Mary J. Kelly were named as defendants in an action commenced in the court below on December 31, 1910, to quiet title to certain real property described in the complaint against all persons claiming any interest therein. Defendants Lucy H. Allyne, Edith W. Allyne, and Agnes M. McGuire answered, admitting plaintiff's ownership and right to possession of all lands described in the complaint with the exception of a certain parcel known as Emmet place. As to said parcel, they alleged that they and each of them had a private right of way over it to and from adjoining lands owned by them, and that it was, and for more than forty years prior thereto had been, a public highway or street. Defendant Mary J. Kelly, since deceased, whose representative did not join in the petition herein, filed an answer of similar import. Defendant and petitioner City and County of San Francisco also filed an answer in which it alleged that the property in question constituted an open public street or highway. The case was tried on July 17, 1913, and a decree entered on November 29, 1913, adjudging plaintiff to be the owner and entitled to the possession of all lands described in the complaint with the exception of Emmet Place. As to said Emmet Place it was adjudged that plaintiff was the owner of the westerly thirty-nine feet; that the entire parcel was a public street or alley, and that the public and said defendants had the right to pass over and use the same as and for a public street or alley. 664 ALLYNE v. SUPERIOR COURT. [200 Cal.

Thereafter plaintiff made a motion for a new trial, which was granted on October 18, 1916. No further action was taken until September 24, 1925, almost nine years later, when those of defendants who are petitioners herein gave notice that they would move the court to dismiss the action upon the ground that plaintiff had failed to bring the action to trial within five years after the entry of the order granting a new trial. Plaintiff thereupon filed a notice of motion to set the cause for trial and also an affidavit in opposition to defendants' motion to dismiss, setting forth therein purported grounds for failure to bring the action to a second trial. The motion of plaintiff was granted and that of defendants denied.

Section 583 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides: "The court may in its discretion dismiss any action for want of prosecution on motion of the defendant after due notice to the plaintiff, whenever plaintiff has failed for two years after answer filed to bring such action to trial. Any action heretofore or hereafter commenced shall be dismissed by the court in which the same shall have been commenced or to which it may be transferred on motion of the defendant, after due notice to plaintiff or by the court of its own motion, unless such action is brought to trial within five years after the defendant has filed his answer, except where the parties have stipulated in writing that the time may be extended."

[2] The plain and obvious purpose of the foregoing section is to regulate the matter of compulsory dismissals only under one set of circumstances, to wit, where an answer has been filed and the action has not been brought to trial within five years thereafter. Other sections in the same chapter of the code provide for dismissals under other circumstances, and if none of said sections pertaining to dismissals cover the situation in the instant case, where more than five years have elapsed since the entry of the order granting a new trial, it must be held that it is the duty of the trial judge to determine the question as to the reasonableness of the delay, and his determination cannot be disturbed by an appellate court unless it is made to appear that he has abused his discretion. Impliedly the court below held that it was satisfied that there was a reasonable excuse for the delay. In the case at bar the stage in the proceedings to which sec- March, 1927.] ALLYNE v. SUPERIOR COURT. 665

tion 583 applied has passed, inasmuch as the action was brought to trial within slightly less than three years after the filing of the answer. For this delay the defendants were not entitled to have the case dismissed as a mandatory right (*Romero v. Snyder*, 167 Cal. 216 [138 Pac. 1002]), but the court, in the exercise of the discretion given it by said section 583, might have dismissed the action upon motion of the defendants. But a motion for dismissal was not made and, inasmuch as the action was brought to trial within the five-year period of limitation, the requirements of the statute were satisfied. Section 583 does not purport to lay down a rule governing cases in which an action has not been brought to trial within a period of five years immediately following the entry of an order granting a new trial. We are asked by the petitioners to do more than indulge in a liberal construction of a statute. We are asked here to extend a statute's operation by implication to a subject which, in the absence of a statutory regulation, was concededly within the discretion of the trial court. Section 583 was intended, no doubt, to compel expedition in the trial and disposition of causes. While this is admittedly so, we find no warrant in its language that would justify us in reading into the section words which would clearly compel a dismissal if an action be not retried within five years after a new trial has been granted. The words in the section are to be interpreted according to their common acceptance. (*Perrin v. Miller*, 35 Cal. App. 129 [169 Pac. 426].)

The case of *Romero v. Snyder*, 167 Cal. 216 [138 Pac. 1002], in which an attempt was made to extend the section to cover cases without its purview, while not conclusive on the point raised here, is persuasive, inasmuch as it refused to depart from the express language of the statute. In that case a motion to dismiss made within less than two years after demurrer filed was granted. The proceeding thereafter came before this court on appeal from the judgment of dismissal. It was there contended that the provision of section 583 authorizing the court in its discretion to "dismiss any action for want of prosecution on motion of the defendant and after due notice to the plaintiff, whenever plaintiff has failed for two years after answer filed to bring such action to trial" impliedly prohibited the court from dismissing within less than two years after answer filed, and 666 ALLYNE v. SUPERIOR COURT. [200 Cal.

that a *demurrer* was an *answer* within the meaning of the section. The court held that appellant was correct in the contention that an action could not be dismissed within less than two years after answer filed, but further held that a demurrer was not an answer, and where only a demurrer had been filed a dismissal might be made on the ground that a delay of less than two years was unreasonable. The statements made by the court in this case to the effect that said section 583 purports to cover the entire subject of dismissals after answer filed can fairly be interpreted to mean only after answer filed and before an action has been once brought to trial. If the five-year limitation were to be held to apply in the case at bar, it would necessarily follow that the two-year limitation would also apply, and that a trial judge would be powerless to determine that a delay of less than two years was unreasonable and warranted a dismissal. We cannot hold that the legislature has indicated an intention to accomplish such a result by the enactment of section 583.

[3] It was the evident theory of petitioners, as shown by the notice of motion to dismiss the action, that it was the mandatory duty of the court to dismiss said cause, it not having been brought to trial within five years after the granting of the motion for a new trial. The notice specifically mentions the failure of plaintiff to bring the cause to trial within that period. The question of the abuse of discretion seems not to have been seriously urged by petitioners on the motion for a dismissal. The petition as framed does not plead facts sufficient to show that the court committed an abuse of discretion. We are not able to say as a matter of law that the long delay in bringing the case to a retrial was not excusable under the state of facts shown to exist upon the hearing of the motion, which was presumptively deemed sufficient to justify the court in exercising its discretion in the manner complained of. The facts are not before us. All that is presented in this respect is an affidavit made by the plaintiff in which he avers that certain negotiations were pending between some of the parties litigant, which, it was believed, would put an end to the litigation if consummated. If the affidavit above referred to was the only ground relied upon by the court to support its action we would incline to the view that it did not furnish March, 1927.] PERKINS MFG. CO. V. JORDAN. 667

a valid reason to warrant a denial of the motion. But we cannot presume that there were not other valid reasons which justified the court in making its order. There is nothing in the petition which would in any way tend to dispute the presumption that evidence was adduced fully supporting the court in the exercise of its discretion. "The petition for a writ of mandate must state specific facts sufficient to justify the granting of relief sought, and make a clear *prima facie* case to warrant the alternative writ." (16 Cal. Jur. 859.)

We therefore conclude that the portion of section 583 which makes it the mandatory duty of a court to dismiss an action which is not brought to trial within five years after answer filed has no application to the retrial of causes, and, as to the second ground, that an abuse of the discretionary power of the court to dismiss the action has not been sufficiently alleged in the petition. While nine years is a long period for an action to lie in repose, we cannot say that there may not, conceivably, be rare cases in which it would not be an abuse of discretion to refuse to dismiss. The demurrer to the petition is well taken.

The writ is denied.

predicated solely upon the authorized capital stock of the corporation, is violative of the commerce clause and the fourteenth amendment to the constitution of the United States, in that it lays an unwarranted burden upon interstate commerce, taxes properly outside the state over which the state of California has no jurisdiction, and denies to persons within the jurisdiction of California equal protection of the laws.

[2] Id.—VALIDITY OF LICENSE TAX LAW—STATUTE.—In order that an act proposing a license fee upon foreign corporations desiring to transact intrastate business in this state be valid the tax must bear at least some relation to property owned and used and business carried on or proposed to be carried on within the state of California.

[3] Id.—FILING FEES—PRIVILEGE OR EXCISE TAX—TESTS.—The contention cannot be maintained that a different principle may apply in the case of filing fees graded on authorized capital than in the case of a privilege or excise tax based upon authorized capital. The effect upon interstate commerce and upon equal protection of the law to persons in the several states is the test, and neither the name nor the aim of the state tax can suffice to prevent consideration of the necessary effect and consequences of the state statute.

[4] Id.—MEASURE OF TAX—AUTHORIZED CAPITAL.—The authorized capital stock of a foreign corporation is not a proper foot rule for measuring license tax fees required to be paid by the corporation.

[5] Id.—LICENSE TAX FEE—SEVERABLE PROVISIONS OF ACT—MANDAMUS.—The provisions of the corporation license tax act of this state with regard to the license fee of foreign corporations is severable from the other provisions of the act and mandamus is the proper remedy to test the validity of such provisions.

Dunne, Dunne & Cook, Amici Curiae.

PRESTON, J.—The state of California by the act of May 10, 1915 (Stats. 1915, p. 422), and several subsequent acts amendatory and supplementary thereto (Deering's Gen. Laws 1923, Act 1743, p. 548), put into effect a comprehensive plan regulating and governing the right of foreign corporations to transact intrastate business therein.

The act requires the filing with the Secretary of State by the corporation of an authenticated copy of its charter, together with payment of a certain filing fee therefor; also the filing of an affidavit showing the authorized capital stock of said corporation on January 1st of the current year; also the designation of a resident agent in said state upon whom service of process may be had. The act then further provides for the payment of an annual license tax or fee as follows:

"Sec. 3. Except those corporations hereinafter specified, every corporation incorporated under the laws of this state, and every corporation incorporated under the laws of any other state, territory, or foreign country now doing intrastate business within this state, or which shall hereafter engage in intrastate business within this state, shall procure annually from the secretary of state a license authorizing the transaction of such business in this state, and pay therefor the license tax prescribed herein.

"For the purpose of measuring said tax the secretary of state shall examine all articles of incorporation and all documents on file in his office relating to an increase or decrease in the authorized capital stock of corporations which are subject to said tax, and determine the amount due from each corporation by the following rule:

"When the authorized capital stock of the corporation does not exceed ten thousand dollars, the tax shall be ten dollars; when the authorized capital stock exceeds ten thousand dollars, but does not exceed twenty thousand dollars, the tax shall be fifteen dollars; when the authorized capital 670 PERKINS MFG. CO. V. JORDAN. [200 Cal.

stock exceeds twenty thousand dollars but does not exceed fifty thousand dollars, the tax shall be twenty dollars; when the authorized capital stock exceeds fifty thousand dollars but does not exceed one hundred thousand dollars, the tax shall be twenty-five dollars; when the authorized capital stock exceeds one hundred thousand dollars but does not exceed two hundred fifty thousand dollars, the tax shall be fifty dollars; when the authorized capital stock exceeds two hundred fifty thousand dollars but does not exceed five hundred thousand dollars, the tax shall be seventy-five dollars; when the authorized capital stock exceeds five hundred thousand dollars but does not exceed one million dollars, the tax shall be one hundred dollars; when the authorized capital stock exceeds one million dollars but does not exceed three million dollars, the tax shall be two hundred dollars; when the authorized capital stock exceeds three million dollars but does not exceed five million dollars, the tax shall be three hundred fifty dollars; when the authorized capital stock exceeds five million dollars, but does not exceed seven million five hundred thousand dollars, the tax shall be five hundred fifty dollars; when the authorized capital stock exceeds seven million five hundred thousand dollars but does not exceed ten million dollars, the tax shall be eight hundred dollars; when the authorized capital stock exceeds ten million dollars, the tax shall be one thousand dollars; when the capital stock of any corporation has no par value the tax shall be one hundred dollars; when a part of the capital stock of any corporation has a par value and a part of such stock has no par value, the tax shall be computed upon such par value stock in accordance with the admeasurement schedule herein established, to which sum shall be added the sum of fifty dollars. Building and loan companies and associations shall pay an annual license tax of ten dollars.

"All corporations having no capital stock, but organized for profit shall pay an annual tax of ten dollars. Said license tax shall be due and payable to the secretary of state on the first day of January of each and every year. Such license tax shall be paid on or before the hour of six o'clock P. M. of the first Monday of February of each year and if not so paid shall at said hour become delinquent and there shall thereupon be added thereto as a penalty for such delinquency the sum of ten dollars." March, 1927.] PERKINS MFG. CO. V. JORDAN. 671

The act also provides penalties for failure to pay the license fee within the time prescribed by law and for persistent failure provides for a forfeiture of its right to transact business within the state. It also makes it a misdemeanor to carry on business within the state after such right has been forfeited and perhaps some other penalties.

The proceeding before us involves the validity of said above-quoted provision requiring the payment of the annual license fee. It will be noted that this fee is in nowise regulated by either the amount of property owned, capital employed or business done within the state. Indeed, it bears no relation whatever to the property owned, capital employed, or business volume of the corporation either in or out of the state or at all. The tax is predicated solely upon the authorized capital stock of the corporation and is wholly without relation to any other standard. Again, the corporation thus taxed may never issue the amount of stock authorized and, if it does, it may employ the whole thereof in its business elsewhere than in California. A corporation with a small amount of authorized capital stock may be doing an immense business in California and be required to pay only a small privilege tax, whereas, on the other hand, a corporation with a large authorized capital stock may be doing an insignificant amount of business in California and under this act be required to pay a larger privilege tax. Further, two corporations may be doing an equal amount of business in California; one with an authorized capital of $100,000 dollars would be required to pay a tax of $25, while the other with an authorized capital of $1,000,000 would be required to pay a tax of $100 for no greater privilege.

Petitioner asserts the invalidity of that portion of said act above quoted in an original proceeding in mandate against respondent as Secretary of State, alleging substantially as follows:

(a) That it is a foreign corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the state of Minnesota, with its principal place of business at St. Paul therein.

(b) That it is engaged in the business of manufacturing, selling, and installing wood and metal doors, ornamental iron, wire goods, structural steel, and sheet metal products, including especially steel rolling doors, tinclad doors and 672 PERKINS MFG. CO. V. JORDAN. [200 Cal.
similar products, and is carrying on such trade in both interstate and intrastate commerce throughout the country.

(c) That it has an authorized capital stock of $50,000, with, however, only $20,000 thereof issued and outstanding, which said latter amount represents the total investment in said business.

(d) That as a part of its interstate business it is advisable and financially advantageous to it to carry on in several states intrastate business as well as interstate business, which said intrastate business is inseparably and inextricably interwoven with its interstate business.

(e) That the amount of capital employed in California does not exceed one-half of one per cent of its total invested capital.

(f) That desiring to qualify for the transaction of intrastate business in the state of California it did on April, 1, 1926, offer to comply with said above-mentioned act, known as the Corporation License Act, by tendering to the Secretary of State a certified copy of its charter, with regular filing fee therefor, affidavit as to authorized capital stock and designation of a resident agent, and offered to comply with all other provisions of said act applicable thereto, save and alone the payment of the sum of $15 claimed by said respondent as such Secretary of State as a license fee under the above-quoted provision of said act.

Respondent by admission or insufficient denial conceded the existence of the foregoing facts, but refused to accept said copy of charter and other documents tendered or to allow same to be filed or to otherwise allow petitioner to qualify for intrastate business unless and until it paid the said license tax. The pleadings, proof, and admission of facts above noted bring squarely before us the validity of said provision requiring an annual license fee when tested by the commerce clause of and the fourteenth amendment to the constitution of the United States.

Of course, it requires no debate nor review of authorities to hold that the plain duty of this court is to speedily mold its rulings in conformity with the decisions of the supreme court of the United States upon these subjects. The strength and stability of our federation of states lie in our non-interference with the constitutional powers which have been specially ceded to the central government. It was upon this March, 1927.] PERKINS MFG. CO. V. JORDAN. 673

very point that the Articles of Confederation were weak and the condition was remedied by the commerce clause, the fourteenth amendment, and other powers which have been reposed by the constitution exclusively in the federal government.

Unfortunately for respondent in this case, the supreme court of the United States has squarely and plainly spoken on the subject before us and has promulgated the following canons of interpretation:

"In cases involving the validity of laws of a state imposing license fees or excise taxes on corporations organized in another state, this court has decided:

"'1. The power of a State to regulate the transaction of a local business within its borders by a foreign corporation,—meaning a corporation of a sister State,—is not unrestricted or absolute, but must be exerted in subordination to the limitations which the Constitution places on state action.

"'2. Under the commerce clause exclusive power to regulate interstate commerce rests in Congress, and a state statute which either directly or by its necessary operation burdens such commerce is invalid, regardless of the purpose with which it was enacted.

"'3. Consistently with the due process clause, a State cannot tax property belonging to a foreign corporation and neither located nor used within the confines of the State.

"'4. That a foreign corporation is partly, or even chiefly engaged in interstate commerce does not prevent a State in which it has property and is doing a local business from taxing that property and imposing a license fee or excise in respect of that business, but the State cannot require the corporation as a condition of the right to do a local business therein to submit to a tax on its interstate business or on its property outside the State.

"'5. A license fee or excise of a given percent. of the entire authorized capital of a foreign corporation doing both a local and interstate business in several states although declared by the State imposing it to be merely a charge for the privilege of conducting a local business therein, is essentially and for every practical purpose a tax on the entire business of the corporation, including that which is interstate, and on its entire property, including that in other States; and this because the capital stock of the corpora-

tion represents all its business of every class and all its property wherever located.'' (International Paper Co. v. Massachusetts, 246 U. S. 135, 141 [Ann. Cas. 1918C, 617, 62 L. Ed. 624, 38 Sup. Ct. Rep. 292, 294, see, also, Rose's U. S. Notes Supp.]; Airway Elec. Appliance Corp. v. Day, 266 U. S. 71 [69 L. Ed. 169, 45 Sup. Ct. Rep. 12].)

[1] Petitioner insists that the provision of the Corporation License Act in question is clearly violative under the above specifications of both the commerce clause and the fourteenth amendment in that it lays an unwarranted burden upon interstate commerce; taxes property outside the state over which the state of California has no jurisdiction; and denies to persons within the jurisdiction of California the equal protection of the laws. Clearly, there is no escape from this conclusion. Indeed, the case of *Airway etc. Corp. v. Day, supra*, seems squarely to decide these very questions. There a law of the state of Ohio was under test, the germane provisions of which were as follows:

"Section 5503 (enacted May 31, 1911), imposes an annual fee required of foreign corporations having capital stock with par value as follows: 'On or before October fifteenth, the auditor of state shall charge for collection, as herein provided, annually, from such company, in addition to the initial fees otherwise provided for by law, for the privilege of exercising its franchises in this state, a fee of three-twentieths of one per cent. upon the proportion of the authorized capital stock of the corporation represented by the property owned and used and business transacted in this state. . . .'

"An act of May 17, 1921 (secs. 8728–11, General Code of Ohio), provides: ' . . . The amount of fees payable by a foreign corporation having common stock without par value . . . under section 5503 shall be three-twentieths of one per cent. upon the proportion of the authorized preferred stock represented by property owned and used and business transacted in this state and five cents per share upon the proportion of the number of shares of authorized common stock, represented by property owned and used and business transacted in this state. . . .'" (*Airway etc. Corp. v. Day, supra*, pp. 78, 79.)

It will be noted that this Ohio statute makes a pretense at least of setting up a standard bearing some relation to prop- March, 1927.] PERKINS MFG. CO. V. JORDAN. 675

erty owned and used and business done within said state. In the case before us we have not even this consolation for, as above noted, the act has as its only measure the authorized capital stock of the corporation, regardless of the property owned and used or business done within the state of California.

The facts in the Ohio case were as follows: Plaintiff was incorporated under the laws of Delaware, with an authorized capital stock of 400,000 shares without par value, one-half of which was common stock and the other half founders' stock. The only difference between the two classes of stock was the voting power thereof. The corporation obtained from the secretary of the state of Ohio, in conformity with its laws, a certificate of admission to do business in that state, and it also paid the initial fee for the privilege of there exercising its franchise. It also had a certificate from the commissioner of securities of said state authorizing it to sell its stock therein. It acquired two large manufacturing plants at Toledo and commenced the business of manufacturing electrical household appliances and selling them in intrastate and interstate commerce. It had issued only 50,485 shares of stock, of which 10,010 shares were common and 40,475 were founders' stock. All of its property, valued at $458,278.56 was located in Ohio and the amount of business transacted the preceding year was $250,951.58. The admitted value of the stock was $7 per share. An annual license fee of $20,000 was demanded and by reason of the intrastate business as distinguished from the entire business transacted, it was reduced to $14,926. In other words, instead of being calculated on 400,000 shares, it was calculated on 298,520 shares, the first charge being about eight times the issued capital stock, and the latter amount being six times the issued capital stock.

The supreme court of the United States, without dissent on the part of any member thereof, declared this law invalid, using in part the following language:

"All plaintiff's business, intrastate and interstate, and all its property wherever located were represented by the 50,485 shares of stock outstanding. The annual fee demanded by the state officers is five cents per share on 400,000 shares, and that fixed by the lower court is based on 298,520 shares. The inevitable effect of the act is to tax and directly burden 676 PERKINS MFG. CO. V. JORDAN. [200 Cal.
interstate commerce of foreign corporations permitted to do business in Ohio, and engaged in interstate commerce, wherever the number of shares authorized, subject to the charge of five cents each, exceeds the number of outstanding shares attributable to or represented by the corporations, property and business in that state. In this case, the fee fixed by the commission was based on nearly eight times the number of outstanding shares and that determined by the court on nearly six times that number. As some of the outstanding shares are represented by plaintiff's interstate business, the application of the rate to all the shares, or to a number greater than the total outstanding, necessarily amounts to a tax and direct burden upon all the property and business including the interstate commerce of the plaintiff. (International Paper Co. v. Massachusetts, supra, 142.) We hold that the act violates the commerce clause.

"The fee determined by the lower court, as well as that fixed by the state officers, is arbitrary. Without holding that such a charge must be measured by the value of the privilege for which it is imposed, it may be said that some relation to such value is a reasonable requirement. . . . The number of nonpar value shares of the corporation is not an indication of, and does not purport to be a representation as to, the amount of its capital. Each outstanding share represents merely an aliquot part of its assets. The number of shares not subscribed or issued has no relation to the privilege held by plaintiff in Ohio, and is not a reasonable measure of such a fee. Such shares may never be subscribed or issued, or additional shares may be issued to acquire property or do business in other states or to carry on interstate commerce. Plainly the fee, to the extent that it is based on a number of shares in excess of those outstanding, has no relation to what was paid in for the stock or to its value or to the amount of plaintiff's capital, its property or its business, intrastate in Ohio or interstate. The act in its practical operation does not require like fees for equal privileges held by foreign corporations in Ohio under the same circumstances. Unless, under the laws of the states where organized they chance to be authorized to issue the same number of nonpar value shares, the annual franchise fees imposed on foreign corporations having the same amount of property and business, and exercising the same privileges March, 1927.] PERKINS MFG. CO. v. JORDAN. 677

in Ohio will not be the same; and the charge imposed on one may be many times that made against another. . . . Again, compare two corporations organized in a sister state having the same number of authorized nonpar value shares, one having property and business of little value, all in Ohio, and the other having much more property and business in that state, and also much property and business in other states. The act would require the former to pay five cents per share on all its shares, but would require the latter to pay a fee based only on the proportion of its shares representing its property owned and used and business transacted in Ohio.

"It is clear that the mere number of authorized nonpar value shares is not a reasonable basis for the classification of foreign corporations for the purpose of determining the amount of such annual fees. Such a classification is not based on anything having relation to the purpose for which it is made. (Southern Ry. Co. v. Greene, 216 U. S. 400, 417 [17 Ann. Cas. 1247, 54 L. Ed. 536, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 287, see, also, Rose's U. S. Notes]; Royster Guano Co. v. Virginia, 253 U. S. 412, 415 [64 L. Ed. 989, 40 Sup. Ct. Rep. 560, see, also, Rose's U. S. Notes Supp.].) The act has no tendency to produce equality; and it is of such a character that there is no reasonable presumption that substantial equality will result from its application. (Martin v. District of Columbia, 205 U. S. 135, 139 [51 L. Ed. 743, 27 Sup. Ct. Rep. 440]; Gast Realty Co. v. Schneider Granite Co., 240 U. S. 55, 58 [60 L. Ed. 523, 36 Sup. Ct. Rep. 254]; Kansas City Southern Ry. Co. v. Road Improvement District, 256 U. S. 658, 660 [65 L. Ed. 1151, 41 Sup. Ct. Rep. 604].) The act violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment." (Airway etc. Corp. v. Day, supra, pp. 82–85.)

"It must now be regarded as settled that a state may not burden interstate commerce or tax property beyond her borders under the guise of regulating or taxing intrastate business. So to burden interstate commerce is prohibited by the commerce clause; and the fourteenth amendment does not permit taxation of property beyond the state's jurisdiction. The amount demanded is unimportant when there is no legitimate basis for the tax. So far as the language of Baltic Min. Co. v. Massachusetts, 231 U. S. 68, 87 [58 L. Ed. 678 PERKINS MFG. CO. V. JORDAN. [200 Cal.

127, 134, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 15], tends to support a different view, it conflicts with conclusions reached in later opinions, and is now definitely disapproved." (Alpha Portland Cement Co. v. Massachusetts, 268 U. S. 203, 218 [44 A. L. R. 1219, 69 L. Ed. 916, 45 Sup. Ct. Rep. 477].)

These decisions re-align the court in accord with such previous decisions as Western Union Tel. Co. v. Kansas, 216 U. S. 1 [54 L. Ed. 355, 30 Sup. Ct. Rep. 190], Pullman Co. v. Kansas, 216 U.

Rep. 481], Bucks Stove & Range Co. v. Vickers, 226 U. S. 205 [57 L. Ed. 189, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 41], and produce harmony between those decisions and the following cases: Looney v. Crane Co., 245 U. S. 178 [62 L. Ed. 230, 38 Sup. Ct. Rep. 85], International Paper Co. v. Massachusetts, 246 U. S. 135 [Ann. Cas. 1918C, 617, 62 L. Ed. 624, 38 Sup. Ct. Rep. 292], Airway etc. Corp. v. Day, supra, and Alpha Portland Cement Co. v. Massachusetts, supra.

The so-called Baltic-Dental case (Baltic Mining Co. & S. S. White Mfg. Co. v. Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 231 U. S. 68 [58 L. Ed. 127, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 15]), has in some respects been distinguished in other respects definitely overruled. See Looney v. Crane Co., supra, and Alpha Portland Cement Co. v. Massachusetts, supra.

[2] The effect of this re-alignment of the supreme court of the United States is to necessarily overthrow our holding in the case of Pick & Co. v. Jordan, 169 Cal. 1 [Ann. Cas. 1916C, 1237, 145 Pac. 506], and to revive the doctrine announced in the case of Mulford v. Curry, 163 Cal. 276 [125 Pac. 236]. We accord to the legislature a sincere effort to frame a law that was just so far as the amount of the charges to foreign corporations desiring to enter our state for intrastate business was concerned, and the legislature, no doubt, acted in perfect good faith, relying upon the validity of the decision in the case of Pick & Co. v. Jordan, supra, but in view of the holding of the United States su- March, 1927.] PERKINS MFG. CO. V. JORDAN. 679

preme court above announced, that a law on this subject in order to be valid must bear at least some relation to property owned and used and business carried on or proposed to be carried on within the state of California, we must bow to the supremacy of the federal constitution in this matter as interpreted by the highest court of our country.

[3] There is no substance in the argument of respondent that a different principle may apply in the case of filing fees graded on authorized capital than in the case of a privilege or excise tax based upon authorized capital. The effect upon interstate commerce and upon equal protection of the law to persons in the several states is the test, and neither the name nor the aim of the state tax can suffice to prevent consideration by the supreme court of the United States of the necessary effect and consequences of the state statute.

[4] Respondent contends also that the tax was simply measured by the standard and, being an excise or privilege tax, there can be no objection to using the authorized capital as a foot rule for such measurement. This point is abundantly answered by the above authorities and recently the supreme court of the United States specially dealt with the question as follows:

"One ground on which the state court put its decision was that, in taxing the transfer of the property which the decedent owned in Pennsylvania, it was admissible to take as a basis for computing the tax the combined value of that property and the property in New York and Massachusetts. Of course, this was but the equivalent of saying that it was admissible to measure the tax by a standard which took no account of the distinction between what the state had power to tax and what it had no power to tax, and which necessarily operated to make the amount of the tax just what it would have been had the state's power included what was excluded by the Constitution. This ground, in our opinion, is not tenable. It would open the way for easily doing indirectly what is forbidden to be done directly, and would render important constitutional limitations of no avail. If Pennsylvania could tax according to such a standard, other states could. It would mean, as applied to the Frick estate, that Pennsylvania, New York and Massachusetts could each impose a tax based on the value of the entire estate, although severally having jurisdiction of only parts of it. Without 680 PERKINS MFG. CO. V. JORDAN: [200 Cal.

question each state had power to tax the transfer of so much of the estate as was under its jurisdiction, and also had some discretion in respect of the rate; but none could use that power and discretion in accomplishing an unconstitutional end, such as indirectly taxing the transfer of the part of the estate which was under the exclusive jurisdiction of others. (Citing many cases.)" (Frick v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, 268 U. S. 473 [42 A. L. R. 316, 69 L. Ed. 1058, 45 Sup. Ct. Rep. 603, 606].)

There are other attacks made by petitioner and by amici curiae under the same provisions of the constitution of the United States upon the statute in question, but the above holding makes it unnecessary to further pursue this branch of the subject.

[5] There is likewise no merit to the contention of respondent that mandate will not lie because if this provision is invalid the whole act must fall with it. We think the provision in question and the provisions dependent thereon are and each of them is clearly severable from the remainder of the act and that no injury will be done to the integrity of the other provisions by the holding here made. Mandamus is, therefore, the proper remedy. (Mulford & Co. v. Curry, supra; Pick & Co. v. Jordan, supra; Melville Clark Piano Co. v. Jordan, 169 Cal. 804 [145 Pac. 516].)

We find nothing in the cases of Schwab (Oceanic Steamship Co.) v. Richardson, 188 Cal. 27 [204 Pac. 396], 263 U. S. 88 [68 L. Ed. 183, 44 Sup. Ct. Rep. 60], and The Pullman Company v. Richardson, 185 Cal. 484 [197 Pac. 346], 261 U. S. 330 [67 L. Ed. 682, 43 Sup. Ct. Rep. 366], which is opposed to the views above announced.

Let the writ of mandate issue as prayed for.

CHARLES M. MIX, Appellant, v. F. E. YOAKUM et al., as Executors, etc., Respondents.

[1] TRUSTS—ESTATES OF DECEASED PERSONS—CLAIM—PLEADING—PROVISIONS OF COMPLAINT.—In an action upon a claim against the estate of a deceased person, allegations of the complaint are sufficient to establish an express trust where it is averred that the plaintiff, who had confidence in the deceased for special reasons, deposited with the deceased a certain sum of money upon the representation of the deceased that he and another would hold the funds for plaintiff "as a trust fund" to be by them loaned to various persons such as they should elect, and that such funds would earn not less than twelve per cent per annum, that they would pay the plaintiff such interest as his money would earn from time to time, and that they would "repay to him the principal at such time as he should demand the same."

[2] ID.—REJECTED CLAIM—ACTION ON.—It is well settled that in an action on a rejected claim against the estate of a deceased person the claimant can only recover upon the cause of action set forth in his claim.

[3] ID.—CAUSES OF ACTION—DISTINCTION BETWEEN.—There is a clear distinction between the cause of action of one who claims specific property held and claimed by the estate of a deceased person adversely to the claimant and a cause of action founded upon a claim against the estate; in the one case the claimant is in no sense a creditor of the estate and in the other he occupies the position of a creditor.

[4] ID.—TRACING OF FUNDS—WHEN UNNECESSARY—GENERAL CREDITOR.—In such an action plaintiff is not compelled to allege and prove the specific fund or property in the hands of the estate into which his funds went, where he is seeking to recover as a general creditor.

[5] ID.—POSSESSION OF FUNDS—PLEADING—PARTIES—APPEAL.—The objection in such a case that the complaint does not allege that the funds are not in the possession of the party who, with the decedent, was possessed of them cannot be considered on appeal, the question involving the sufficiency of the complaint as against a special demurrer on the ground of a defect or misjoinder of parties defendant.

[6] ID.—DEMAND—PLEADING.—In such an action it is not necessary to allege in the complaint a demand for the money made prior

2. See 11 Cal. Jur. 800. 682 MIX v. YOAKUM. [200 Cal.

to the death of the decedent, or that there was any repudiation of the trust during the lifetime of the decedent. The cause of action did not accrue against the testator during his lifetime but did accrue against the executors of his estate.

[7] Id.—STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.—The statute of limitations began to run in such a case upon the rejection of the claim by the executors or upon the demand upon the executors and their refusal to act.

[8] Id.—REJECTION OF CLAIM—ELECTION.—The filing of the complaint after the expiration of the tenth day following the presentation of the claim to the executors, and within the statutory period, constituted an election on the part of the plaintiff to deem the claim rejected, and it was not necessary to allege in the complaint such fact.

[9] Id.—PLEADING—PRAYER.—The fact that a plaintiff may have demanded more than he was entitled to does not render the complaint subject to demurrer on that ground.

[10] Id.—JUDGMENT—PAYMENT.—A judgment in such case would necessarily have to be paid in due course of administration, as plaintiff was a general creditor, but it is not necessary to pray in the complaint that the judgment be so paid.

[11] Id.—PLEADING—CONSTRUCTION.—Since the enactment of section 452 of the Code of Civil Procedure in 1872 it has been generally recognized that in the construction of a pleading for the purpose of determining its effect, its allegations must be liberally construed, with a view to substantial justice between the parties.

[12] Id.—PRESUMPTIONS.—If it be assumed that there is a presumption against the pleader when the pleading is silent as to an essential averment, such presumption would not go to the length of requiring allegations in anticipation of matters of defense or to negative the existence of defensive matters.

Newby & Palmer for Appellant.

Meserve & Meserve and Timon E. Owens for Respondents.

SHENK, J.—This is an appeal from a judgment dismissing an action on a claim against the estate of Finis E. Yoakum, deceased. A demurrer, general and special, to the amended complaint was overruled in one department of the trial court and the defendants answered. When the cause proceeded to trial in another department, a witness on behalf of the plaintiff having been sworn, counsel for the defendants objected to the introduction of any evidence on the ground that the said amended complaint did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The objection was sustained, the plaintiff declined to amend, and the judgment of dismissal from which this appeal is taken was entered.

Briefly stated, the plaintiff alleges that prior to his death the decedent was a minister who claimed to be a divine healer; that the plaintiff had an invalid child who the decedent said was possessed of a demon, which he would drive out of the child by prayer; that plaintiff relied on the assurance of the decedent in that respect, was converted to the latter's faith, attended his church and remained a communicant thereof until the death of the decedent, still having and retaining the greatest confidence in the integrity and benevolence of the decedent; that in May, 1906, the plaintiff was about to return to his old home in an eastern state because of his inability to obtain employment in California, of which fact, and also of the fact that the plaintiff had some funds on hand, the decedent became aware; that thereupon decedent represented to the plaintiff that if he would remain in California he would continue to pray for the plaintiff's daughter, and that if plaintiff would deliver to the decedent the said funds the decedent and one D. M. McDonald would hold the funds for plaintiff "as a trust fund," to be by them loaned to various persons such as they should select, and that such funds would earn not less than twelve per cent per annum; that they would pay the plaintiff such interest as his money would earn 684 MIX V. YOAKUM. [200 Cal.
from time to time, and that they "would repay to him the principal at such time as he should demand the same"; that the plaintiff, because of the confidential relations existing as aforesaid, believed and relied upon the said representations, and so believing and relying he delivered to said Yoakum and the said McDonald checks, United States bonds and money aggregating $3,300 to be used by them in making said loans; that the said Yoakum and McDonald paid to the plaintiff interest on said sum of $3,300 at the rate of twelve per cent per annum, which they reported to the plaintiff was earned by said money, up to and until the fourth day of April, 1915; that there is now due from the said estate the sum of $3,300 with interest at the rate of twelve per cent per annum from April 4, 1915, no part of which has been paid, except several items in the aggregate amount of $167.89, the last of which was paid September, 1917. It was further alleged that the said Finis E. Yoakum died testate on the seventeenth day of August, 1920, leaving an estate in the county of Los Angeles; that his will was admitted to probate and that letters testamentary were issued on April 4, 1921, to the defendants herein; that notice to creditors was first published on April 7, 1921, and that on the twenty-fifth day of the same month the plaintiff presented to the executors his verified claim for $3,300 plus interest thereon at the rate of seven per cent per annum from April 4, 1915, and that said claim was never allowed or rejected by said executors. A copy of the claim is then set forth, in which it is stated that the amounts therein specified aggregating the total of $3,300 were delivered to the decedent and said McDonald to be held by them in trust for the claimant and to be loaned by them for the claimant's use and benefit. No action having been taken on said claim this suit was commenced on February 20, 1922, wherein it is prayed that judgment be rendered for the sum of $3,300, together with interest from the fourth day of April, 1915, at the rate of seven per cent per annum and for general relief.

[1] The defendants attack the complaint on numerous grounds, many of which go to the sufficiency thereof as against a special demurrer and which do not now require consideration. The only question for determination on this March, 1927.]

MIX v. Yoakum.

appeal is whether the plaintiff has set forth facts sufficient to entitle him to relief against the estate.

[2] It is well settled that in an action on a rejected claim a claimant can only recover upon the cause of action set forth in his claim (Estate of Dutard, 147 Cal. 253 [81 Pac. 519], and cases cited). [3] There is a clear distinction between the cause of action of one who claims specific property held and claimed by the estate adversely to the claimant and a cause of action founded upon a claim against the estate. In the one case the claimant is in no sense a creditor of the estate and in the other he occupies the position of a creditor (Estate of Dutard, supra). It is clear that the foundation of the claim of the plaintiff herein is of the latter class. He does not pursue any specific fund or property, but as a general creditor seeks a money judgment which, if obtained, would be paid in due course of administration. The allegations of the complaint follow the averments of the claim and as such are sufficient upon which to establish an express trust. (Schroeder v. Jahns, 27 Cal. 274; Orcutt v. Gould, 117 Cal. 315 [49 Pac. 188].)

[4] It is insisted that the complaint is fatally defective because it does not allege that the trust fund or the proceeds thereof cannot be traced to specific money or property in the hands of the defendants. We do not deem such an averment essential. Counsel for the defendants have cited numerous cases to the effect that when the money or property delivered to the defendant cannot be traced to a specific fund or property in the hands of the personal representative the claimant is in the position of a general creditor and cannot recover except by the presentation of a claim against the estate. But we have been cited to no authority in this state or elsewhere to the effect that the claimant is compelled to allege and prove a specific fund or property in the hands of the estate when he is seeking to recover as a general creditor. It would seem to be true that if the claimant elect to occupy the less advantageous position of a general creditor he has the option to do so, and it must be assumed, in the absence of an allegation to the effect that the trust fund can be traced to specific money or property, that it is impossible for the claimant to so truthfully aver and if he does so aver and prove he may not then be deemed also a general creditor. 686 MIX v. Yoakum. [200 Cal.

[5] It is further insisted that there is no intimation in the complaint that the funds are not in the possession of McDonald. We deem this objection not available to the defendants under the situation here presented, for we cannot now consider the sufficiency of the complaint as against a special demurrer on the ground of a defect or a misjoinder of parties defendant. [6] It is contended that it is not alleged that demand for the money was made prior to the death of the decedent, or that there was any repudiation of the trust during the lifetime of the decedent. Assuming that there was no such demand or repudiation the plaintiff's cause of action was not affected thereby for the reason that the said cause of action under such circumstances did not accrue against the testator during his lifetime but did accrue against the executors of his estate. [7] The statute of limitations would not commence to run until repudiation of the trust or until demand was made. No such repudiation or demand is alleged except the demand upon the executors and their refusal to act. Upon rejection or such refusal the statute would commence to run (Schroeder v. Jahns, supra).

[8] It is contended that the amended complaint is insufficient for the reason that it does not allege that the plaintiff elected to deem the claim rejected after the expiration of the tenth day following its presentation. Section 1496 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides that if an executor refuse or neglect to indorse an allowance or rejection on the claim for ten days after the same has been presented to him such refusal or neglect may "at the option of the claimant, be deemed equivalent to a rejection on the tenth day." The complaint alleges that the said claim was presented to the defendants as executors at the place designated in the notice to creditors, and that the claim has never been allowed or rejected by the executors or either of them. We think the filing of the complaint after the expiration of the tenth day and within the statutory period, as was done in this case, constituted an election on the part of the plaintiff to deem the claim rejected (Cowgill v. Dinwiddie, 98 Cal. 481 [33 Pac. 439]; Barclay v. Blackinton, 127 Cal. 189 [59 Pac. 834]).

likewise demanded. It is insisted that interest is not allowable. Whether interest should be allowed under the facts as developed on the trial is a question we need not now decide. [9] The fact that the plaintiff may have demanded more than that to which he was entitled did not render the complaint subject to the general demurrer. [10] Nor do we think that the plaintiff is not entitled to relief by reason of the fact that a money judgment only is demanded without a prayer that the same be paid in due course of administration. If a judgment for any sum be rendered in favor of the plaintiff it would necessarily be paid in due course of administration for the plaintiff would take his place as a general creditor.

[11] The defendants insist upon the application of the rule that a pleading must be taken most strongly against the pleader. This rule received recognition in the earlier cases (Chipman v. Emeric, 5 Cal. 49 [63 Am. Dec. 80]; Joseph v. Holt, 37 Cal. 250), and the old rule seems to have received some, but we think, ill-considered notice in Silvers v. Grossman, 183 Cal. 696 [192 Pac. 537], where, on page 702, a quotation from Joseph v. Holt, supra, is set forth. Since the enactment of section 452 of the Code of Civil Procedure in 1872 it has been generally recognized that in the construction of a pleading for the purpose of determining its effect "its allegations must be liberally construed, with a view to substantial justice between the parties." (Estate of Wickersham, 153 Cal. 603 [96 Pac. 311]; Menefee v. Oxnam, 42 Cal. App. 81 [183 Pac. 379].) [12] If it be assumed that there is a presumption against the pleader when the pleading is silent as to an essential averment such presumption would not go to the length of requiring allegations in anticipation of matters of defense or to negative the existence of defensive matters (21 Cal. Jur., 51-53).

We conclude that the pleading under attack contains a statement of facts sufficient as against a general demurrer.

The judgment is reversed.

# FRATERS GLASS AND PAINT COMPANY (a Corporation), Appellant, v. SOUTHWESTERN CONSTRUCTION COMPANY (a Corporation) et al., Respondents.

[1] MECHANICS' LIENS — MATERIALMEN — RIGHT OF LIEN — WAIVER — RIGHT TO RECOVER ON BOND.—A materialman may waive, by agreement or otherwise, his right to a lien against the building for the construction of which he has furnished material, without in any way impairing his right to proceed against the sureties upon the undertaking given in compliance with section 1183 of the Code of Civil Procedure.

[2] Id.—WRITTEN WAIVER — CONSTRUCTION.—Where a materialman at the time sureties signed the contractor's bond, upon a building contract, delivered to the sureties a writing in which the former agreed "to wait thirty-five days after completion of said building for payment of same, waiving our lien rights," the right to a lien against the property only was waived, leaving the right of action upon the bond in full force and effect in favor of the materialman.

[3] Id.—APPEAL—RECORD ON.—While it is the rule that in the absence of a transcript or bill of exceptions containing all the evidence it will be presumed upon appeal that the evidence adduced at the trial was competent and material and was sufficient to sustain the facts found, such rule has no application in a case where the trial court found that a writing, which respondent claimed waived appellant's right of action, was duly executed by the appellant and where the intention of the appellant in signing and delivering the writing can be ascertained from the clear and unambiguous language of the writing.

[4] Id.—CONSTRUCTION OF WRITTEN INSTRUMENT.—Under section 1860 of the Code of Civil Procedure and section 1647 of the Civil Code, for the purpose of construing an instrument, the circumstances under which it is made may be shown, but these sections apply only in aid of construction in the real sense, and they have no application where it is sought to add to the language an additional term which is not contained therein.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County. Elliot Craig, Judge. Reversed.

The facts are stated in the opinion of the court.

G. C. De Garmo and H. B. Cornell for Appellant.

Jones & Weller for Respondents.

CURTIS, J.—This action was instituted for the purpose of foreclosing certain materialmen and mechanics' liens. The only cause of action with which we are concerned on this appeal is that on behalf of Fraters Glass and Paint Company, a corporation, the appellant herein. This company sought a judgment against the sureties on the bond given by the contractor to the owner in compliance with the provisions of section 1183 of the Code of Civil Procedure. E. B. Rivers, as the owner of the real property on which the building was constructed, entered into a contract with the Southwestern Construction Company, a corporation, for the construction of said building at an agreed price of $91,000. The contractor gave a bond as required by section 1183 of the Code of Civil Procedure, with the defendants Henry S. Patten and F. W. Patten as sureties, in the sum of $45,500, being fifty per cent of the contract price of said building. There is no claim but that this bond met all the requirements of said section 1183. Under the contract for the construction of said building the appellant, Fraters Glass and Paint Company, furnished glass which was actually used in the construction of said building, the reasonable market value of which was the sum of $5,135.34, no part of which has been paid. Appellant's complaint herein set forth the foregoing facts and asked for judgment against respondents, the said sureties, for the sum of $5,135.34. The respondents in their answer make no denial of the allegations of the complaint, but as a special defense alleged that as a part of the consideration for executing said undertaking and as an inducement to them to execute the same, the appellant prior to the signing of said bond by the sureties executed and delivered to the sureties the following writing: "April 26, 1921. Mr. Henry Patten, Patten & Davies Lumber Co., Los Angeles, California. Dear Sir: In

200 Cal.—44 690 FRATERS G. & P. CO. v. SOUTHWESTERN C. CO. [200 Cal.

connection with the contract between the Southwestern Construction Company, and E. B. Rivers, for a building at Seventh and Central, we agree to furnish glass as arranged with Harry E. Martin, to cost approximately $4000.00, and to wait thirty-five days after completion of said building for payment of same, waiving our lien rights. We are doing this, of course, to help Mr. Martin in this deal and are confident that it will be carried to a successful completion. Very truly yours, Fraters Glass & Paint Co. By J. A. Fraters, Pres." Mr. Martin was the president of said construction company.

Respondents further allege in their answer that it was the intent and purpose of said plaintiff, the appellant herein, by the execution of said writing to relieve said respondents of the burden of said undertaking to the extent of $4,000, and that had it not been for the execution of said writing by the appellant, respondents would not have become sureties upon said undertaking. The trial court found the allegations of respondents' special defense to be true, and rendered judgment accordingly.

On this appeal the appellant attacks these findings as unsupported by any evidence. Appellant contends that by this writing it did nothing more than waive its right to a lien against the building for which it furnished said material, and that this waiver did not extend to nor include its right to proceed against said sureties on said bond for the amount unpaid on its claim. In this connection appellant contends that as a materialman furnishing materials to be used and which were actually used in the construction of said building, it was given under the statute the right to a lien against said building and the land upon which it was constructed, together with a convenient space about the same, and also a right in case of the nonpayment of its claim to proceed against the sureties on said bond for the amount unpaid on its claim; that these two rights are separate, distinct, and independent of each other, and that by waiving its right to a lien against the real property it in no manner impaired its right of action against the sureties on the bond to recover the amount remaining unpaid upon its claim. In support of this contention, appellant relies upon the case of General Elec. Co. v. American Bonding Co., 180 Cal. 675 [182 Pac. 444]. That action was instituted by the plaintiff therein Mar. '27.] FRATERS G. & P. Co. v. SOUTHWESTERN C. Co. 691

against the surety upon a bond given in compliance with section 1183 of the Code of Civil Procedure to recover for the value of materials furnished and which were actually used in the construction of the building referred to in said bond. As a defense to said action the surety set up in its answer the failure of plaintiff therein to file any claim of lien under the provisions of section 1187 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and that during the time within which such a claim of lien might have been filed a large sum of money was due from the owner to the contractor, and which should and would have been applied to plaintiff's claim if the lien had been formally asserted. To this defense the trial court sustained a demurrer and granted a motion to strike it out. Upon appeal this court sustained the action of the trial court and held:

"Section 1197 of the same chapter clearly contemplates suits which may be maintained without the previous filing of liens, for it provides that: 'Nothing contained in this chapter shall be construed to impair or affect the right of any person to whom any debt may be due for work done or materials furnished to maintain a personal action to recover said debt against the person liable therefor; . . . but the judgment, if any, obtained by the plaintiff in such personal action shall not be construed to impair or merge any lien held by said plaintiff under this chapter; provided, only, that any money collected on said judgment shall be credited on the amount of such lien in any action brought to enforce the same, in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.' The bond by its terms creates a direct obligation on the part of the surety to pay for materials used in the construction of the building and the right of action on such bond is preserved by said section 1197 as well as by section 1183.

"It can no doubt be persuasively argued that the bond which must 'be also conditioned for the payment in full of the claims of all persons performing labor upon or furnishing materials to be used in the work' relates to claims of lien filed within time. But it seems to us that this is a strained interpretation. The mere use of the word 'claim,' which is as apt a description of the demand of the individual who has filed no claim of lien as it is of one who has filed such claim, is not persuasive." 692 FRATERS G. & P. CO. v. SOUTHWESTERN C. CO. [200 Cal.

"It is to be noted also that the portion of the section (and of the bond which follows its terms), by which the rights of materialmen are safeguarded, does not use the word 'claims' but the bond is made to 'inure to the benefit of any and all persons who . . . furnish materials to be used in the work described' in the contract.

"But there is another and a very strong reason for rejecting the theory that section 1187 of the Code of Civil Procedure restricts the terms of section 1183 of the Code of Civil Procedure and makes them applicable only to those persons who have filed liens, and that reason is found in the history of the two sections and in the decisions of this court relating thereto."

The court then proceeds to review the history of the legislation affecting these two code sections as well as the decisions of this court relating to such legislation, and concludes by reasserting its conclusion that: "The phrase 'claiming the benefits of this chapter' (found in said section 1187) was thus given a meaning which confined its operation to the benefits of asserting a lien upon the property and did not extend it to include the benefits of any other remedy afforded by the chapter against the owner." This court accordingly held in that case that the waiver of the plaintiff therein of its lien by its failure to file its claim of lien as required by section 1187 of the Code of Civil Procedure did not deprive it of its right of action against the surety on the bond given under the provisions of section 1183 of the Code of Civil Procedure. There can be little, if any, difference between a waiver of lien by a failure to file the claim of lien as required by section 1187 and a waiver by express agreement in so far as such waiver may affect the claimant's right to proceed against the sureties on the bond given under section 1183 of the Code of Civil Procedure. In either case the materialmen or laborers, as the case may be, simply forfeit their right to a lien against the property of the owner without in any way impairing their further and additional right given them under section 1183 to proceed against the sureties upon the bond. This conclusion is in perfect accord with the terms of said section 1183 and with the provisions of the bond in the present proceeding. In said section it is expressly provided that said bond "shall also by its terms be made to inure to the benefit of any Mar. '27.] FRATERS G. & P. Co. v. SOUTHWESTERN C. Co. 693

and all persons who perform labor upon or furnish materials to be used in the work described in said contract so as to give such persons a right of action to recover upon said bond in any suit brought to foreclose the liens provided for in this chapter or *in a separate suit brought on said bond, . . .*" (Italics ours.) The bond in the suit herein provides that: "and the same is hereby expressly made to inure to the benefit of any and all persons who perform labor upon or furnish materials to be used in the work described in said contract, or in any modification thereof, and any and all such persons shall have and are given a right of action to recover upon this bond against the said principal and sureties, or either of them, in any suit brought to foreclose mechanic's liens, which may be filed by such persons, or any of them, upon the property mentioned in said contract, or *in a separate suit brought upon this bond*, and may recover in such action or actions the value of such labor done or materials furnished, or both, not exceeding, however, in the aggregate of said recoveries, the amount of this bond, as above specified." (Italics ours.) [1] It is apparent, therefore, that a material man may waive, by agreement or otherwise, his right to a lien against the building for the construction of which he has furnished material, without in any way impairing his right to proceed against the sureties upon the undertaking given in compliance with section 1183 of the Code of Civil Procedure.

[2] Referring now to the writing signed by the appellant, and which it is claimed by respondents is a waiver of appellant's right to recover in this action on said bond, we find that by its terms it is confined to an agreement to wait thirty-five days after the completion of the building for the payment of its claim and to a waiver of "our lien rights." No reference is made therein as to any waiver of the rights of appellant under said bond. It must be apparent, therefore, of the two rights which the statute gives appellant that by this writing it waived only its right to a lien against the property, leaving its right of action upon the bond in full force and effect and capable of being enforced in a proper proceeding.

[3] It is further insisted, however, that even if it be conceded as true all that has been said herein, yet under the record before us the judgment must be affirmed. This record 694 FRATERS G. & P. CO. v. SOUTHWESTERN C. CO. [200 Cal.

does not contain any evidence, but consists merely of a "Stipulation of Facts," with a further stipulation "That the foregoing may be settled as a bill of exceptions." To this was attached the certificate of the trial judge in the following form: "The foregoing stipulation of facts is hereby settled and allowed as a bill of exceptions and the clerk is hereby instructed to file the same, provided, however, that it is to be noted that the foregoing are not all of the material facts or evidence in the case." Respondents claim that as the certificate of the trial judge shows that the bill of exceptions does not contain all the evidence before the trial court, and as the attack on the foregoing findings is based upon the insufficiency of the evidence to support them, that such attack must fail. Undoubtedly it is the rule that in the absence of a transcript or bill of exceptions containing all the evidence it will be presumed that the evidence adduced at the trial was competent and material and was sufficient to sustain the facts found. But this rule can have no application in the present action, where the court found that the writing was duly executed by the appellant, and where the intention of the appellant in signing and delivering the writing can be ascertained from the clear and unambiguous language of the writing. Under what possible theory of the law could any evidence, aside from the writing itself, be received by the court for the purpose of determining the intent of the appellant in the execution and delivery thereof? The writing is conclusively presumed to speak for itself unless it is uncertain or ambiguous. In what respect can it be said that there is any uncertainty or ambiguity in this writing? There is nothing uncertain about that part thereof whereby the appellant agrees to wait thirty-five days after the completion of the building for payment of its claim, neither is there any ambiguity in the further statement that appellant by so doing waived "our lien rights." The writing, therefore, upon its face is perfectly clear and plain. It is free from any uncertainty or ambiguity. In apt language it expresses the intention of the appellant, and any attempt to show by parol testimony a contrary intention would be to vary its express terms, and such testimony would be inadmissible and incompetent. To attempt to show by a writing whereby the appellant in express terms waived its right to a lien that it thereby intended to and did waive its right of action upon Mar. '27.] FRATERS G. & P. Co. v. SOUTHWESTERN C. Co. 695

the bond, when no mention, either directly or indirectly, is made in the writing to the bond, would be to vary its plain and unambiguous terms by parol testimony. The rule against such a procedure is so well established that no citation of authority is necessary in support of it.

[4] It is true, under section 1860 of the Code of Civil Procedure and section 1647 of the Civil Code, for the purpose of construing an instrument, the circumstances under which it is made may be shown, but these sections apply only in aid of construction in the real sense. They have no application where it is sought, as here, to add to the language an additional term which is not contained therein. This court in the case of *Payne v. Commercial Nat. Bank*, 177 Cal. 68–72 [L. R. A. 1918C, 328, 169 Pac. 1007, 1008], has expressed the rule in apt and convincing language as follows:

"The principal claim of appellant bank is that the trial court erred in refusing to receive parol evidence of the transaction between the plaintiff and the payee named in the check, culminating in the giving of the check, for the purpose of showing the intention of plaintiff to give a check for five hundred dollars to the payee. It seems to be the theory of learned counsel for defendant that under various sections of our Civil Code (1635, 1636, 1637, 1640, 1641, 1643, 1647, 1654), which simply lay down well-settled rules for the construction of the language used in the contract, the ambiguity may be removed and the check treated as one for five hundred dollars. This theory is without any support in the authorities. Rules provided for the construction of contracts are simply for the purpose of ascertaining the true intent and meaning of the *language used therein*. Under these rules parol evidence is admissible where it tends to show the correct interpretation of the language used, the purpose being to enable the court or jury to understand, in the light of the circumstances shown, what the words employed really mean, and to interpret *those words*, in so far as this can reasonably be done, in accord with the intention of the parties as the same may be shown by such circumstances. But no authority sustains the proposition that under the guise of construction or explanation a meaning can be given to the instrument which is not to be found in the instrument itself, but is based entirely 696 FRATERS G. & P. CO. v. SOUTHWESTERN C. CO. [200 Cal.

upon direct evidence of intention independent of the instrument. It has been well said that in the admission of extrinsic evidence the line which separates evidence which aids the interpretation of what is in the instrument from direct evidence of intention independent of the instrument must be kept steadily in view, the duty of the court being to declare the meaning of what is written in the instrument, and not what was intended to be written."

From the foregoing we conclude that the writing executed by appellant and given to the respondents was no more than a waiver by appellant of its right to file a lien; that it was not a waiver of its right of action upon the bond given by the contractor to the owner, on which respondents were sureties; that appellant's right to proceed against said sureties was not waived nor in any manner affected by its waiver of a lien; that said writing, in so far as it expresses the intention of the appellant in executing and delivering it to respondents, is clear and unambiguous, and any testimony offered or admitted for the purpose of showing that appellant's intention was different from that expressed in the writing would be inadmissible and incompetent as an attempt to vary the plain and explicit terms of a writing by parol evidence. It follows, therefore, that the finding of the court that appellant intended by said writing to relieve respondents from any of the burdens of said undertaking is unsupported by the evidence. For this reason the judgment must be reversed, and it is so ordered.

Hill & Morgan and Kenneth K. Wright for Respondent.

SEAWELL, J.—This appeal is taken from a judgment dismissing the action upon an order made sustaining a demurrer to the complaint interposed by defendant Keck with leave to amend, and also from an order denying plaintiff's motion to vacate said order dismissing the action. Defendants Gillespie and Brittain made no appearance. It appears from the judgment that the demurrer was sustained on or about July 10, 1924, with leave to amend said complaint within ten days after service of notice of the court's ruling upon plaintiff's counsel. Notice was accordingly served upon said counsel for plaintiff, who, for a period of more than ten days thereafter, failed, refused, and neglected to amend said complaint. A judgment of dismissal of the action was accordingly made and entered. The facts relied upon as being sufficient to support plaintiff's demand are pleaded as two separate and distinct causes of action. The first alleges that on or about January 23, 1923, at Long Beach, California, for a valuable consideration, defendants J. L. Keck, L. J. Gillespie, and F. E. Brittain executed and delivered to Farmers and Merchants Bank, a corporation, located at Long Beach, California, their joint and several promissory note. Omitting therefrom the provisions for the payment of an attorney's fee and the acknowledgment by defendants of a pledge of undescribed property with said bank as collateral security for the payment of said note, with full authority given to said bank to collect and sell said securities in order to protect itself against depreciation of the value of the same, it is as follows:

"$20,000.00. Long Beach, Cal., January 23, 1923.

"Sixty days after date, for value received, we, or either of us, promise to pay Farmers and Merchants Bank of Long Beach, Cal., or order, at said bank in Long Beach, the sum March, 1927.] BAILES v. KECK. 699

of twenty thousand and no/100 dollars with interest at the rate of eight per cent per annum from date until paid, to be compounded quarterly and bear the same rate of interest as the principal; and should the interest not be paid when due, then the whole sum of principal and interest shall become immediately due and payable, and may be charged to the account in said bank of either the principal maker, or sureties on said note, at the option of the holder of this note. . . . Principal and interest payable in gold coin of the United States."

The order in which the note was signed and the indorsements made thereon follows:

"Due . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . J. L. Keck.

"Indorsement:
"Pay to the order of L. J. Gillespie and F. E. Brittain without recourse.
"FARMERS AND MERCHANTS BANK OF LONG BEACH.
"By C. J. WALKER,
"President."

It is next alleged that prior to the filing of the complaint said Farmers and Merchants Bank indorsed said promissory note without recourse to the order of the defendants L. J. Gillespie, and F. E. Brittain, as set forth in the preceding paragraph, and for a valuable consideration delivered said promissory note to said Gillespie and Brittain and thereafter and prior to the filing of the complaint they, and each of them, for a valuable consideration, indorsed and delivered said promissory note to plaintiff, Bailes, who is the owner and holder thereof. It is alleged that there has been paid upon said principal sum of $20,000 the sum of $15,000, leaving the sum of $5,000 due, owing, and unpaid from defendants on account of principal, together with interest thereon and the sum of $500 as a reasonable sum as attorney's fees. A demand made upon each of said defendants for payment of said sums is also alleged.

The second cause of action is based upon a joint and several sixty-day promissory note, bearing date February 28, 1923, in the sum of $7,500, made, executed, and de- 700 BAILES v. KECK. [200 Cal.

livered to said Farmers and Merchants Bank of Long Beach by the defendants, makers of the promissory note set forth in the first cause of action. The two notes sued upon are identical in form and substance except as to minor and unimportant details. The methods of assignment and the assignees in both causes are identical. Allegations similar in legal effect are set forth in each cause of action. There was paid on account of principal on the $7,500 note, $3,500, leaving due and unpaid on account of the principal, $4,000. A general demurrer was interposed by defendant Keck to both causes of action upon the ground that neither stated a cause of action. The other defendants did not join him in the demurrer or appear in any way. Judgment on the order sustaining the demurrer, upon the failure, refusal and neglect of the plaintiff to amend his complaint, was filed November 21, 1924. The judgment recites as a fact the sustaining of the demurrer on or about July 10, 1924.

Plaintiff's attorney, on July 31, 1924, in a paper properly entitled and filed, directed the county clerk to "enter the dismissal of the above entitled action as to all defendants." On October 11th plaintiff gave notice that on October 17th he would move the court for an order vacating the dismissal of the action and for permission to file an amended complaint and for general relief, the motion to be based upon the affidavit of defendant F. E. Brittain and the accompanying amended complaint. No appeal was taken from the order sustaining the demurrer. The dates of the indorsements of said notes by the bank to Gillespie and Brittain are omitted from the complaint. All that is alleged is that "prior to the filing of the complaint herein" said notes were indorsed to Gillespie and Brittain. This was long after the notes had matured. From an inspection of the indorsements and allegations of the complaint the inference is irresistible that the notes were indorsed or assigned long after maturity.

[1] There can be no doubt that the obligations evidenced by the two promissory notes, as shown upon the face of the complaint, became extinguished by the indorsement and delivery of the same, for a valuable consideration, by the payee, Farmers and Merchants Bank, to Keck's comakers, Gillespie and Brittain. (Gordon v. Wansey, 21 Cal. 77; James v. Yaeger, 86 Cal. 184 [24 Pac. 1005]; Yule v. Bishop, 133 March, 1927.]

Wansey, supra, early declared the law of this state to be that the payment of the obligation by one of the comakers or sureties of a joint and several note and the surrender of the same to such comaker or surety extinguishes the obligation so far as the note is concerned. The doctrine laid down in that case has since been followed consistently by this court and seems to be firmly established as the law. There, for a valuable consideration, the payee assigned several promissory notes to one of the joint and several comakers. The latter, in turn, assigned said notes to Gordon, the plaintiff in said action, who brought suit upon them against Wansey, a comaker with Gordon's assignor. This court held upon the appeal that the transaction amounted to payment and the notes became functus officio and were not revived by the assignment to the plaintiff. It is said that if the rights of the plaintiff had attached before maturity and his position been that of an innocent holder, he would be entitled to protection, but, under the circumstances of that case, the action was not maintainable. The court said that it was clear that the notes could not have been enforced by plaintiff's assignor and having taken them with a knowledge of that fact (as in the instant case) they were equally unavailable in the hands of plaintiff. What the rights of plaintiff might be in an action for contribution, the court observed, it was unnecessary to decide, inasmuch as the action was based on the notes. Again, in James v. Yaeger, supra, the court, addressing itself to the same principle of law announced in Gordon v. Wansey, said:

"It is contended by the appellant that the findings of the court do not sustain the judgment. In this contention we fully agree with counsel for appellant. By the payment to the payee the note became extinct, and ceased to be a binding obligation. (Code Civ. Proc., sec. 1473; Wright v. Mix, 76 Cal. 465 [18 Pac. 645].) And a purchaser of the note after maturity—or in this instance, the note being non-negotiable, whether the purchase was before or after maturity—took it subject to the defense of payment. (Elgin v. Hill, 27 Cal. 373.) Having been paid, it became functus officio, and no action could be maintained upon it. (Gordon v. Wansey, 21 Cal. 79.) If the respondent had been an 702 BAILES v. KECK. [200 Cal.

innocent purchaser, it would have been different. But here, not only was the note non-negotiable and the purchase by the respondent after maturity, but his purchase was from one of the makers of the note. This was sufficient to put him upon inquiry. But it must be presumed, in this case, that the respondent took the note with full knowledge of all the facts."

There is nothing in the cases cited by appellant which tends to shake the doctrine announced in the above cited cases, which is unquestionably applicable to the instant case. The case of *Erkenbrecher v. Grant*, 187 Cal. 7 [200 Pac. 641], cited by appellant, is not an authority announcing a doctrine contrary to that adopted by the cases heretofore cited, but, in reality, is a reaffirmation of the principle announced by this court since its earliest consideration of the question. *Enscoe v. Fletcher*, 1 Cal. App. 659 [82 Pac. 1075], cited by appellant as an authority here, is clearly distinguishable from *Gordon v. Wansey* and the line of cases in harmony with it. In *Enscoe v. Fletcher* certain notes were distributed to one of the joint makers as an heir at law of the payee upon the latter's death. It was held that if the obligation was extinguished it was solely by operation of law brought about by the death of the payee and the distribution of his estate, including the notes, to his heir, who was a joint maker of said notes. The court held that the notes were not and did not purport to be paid in full. Indeed, there was no voluntary assignment or surrender of the notes by the payee to anyone. The payee died, leaving the notes as a part of his estate. That case cannot be accepted as authority for changing the well-recognized rule of law.

[2] The court properly sustained the demurrer as the notes and indorsements gave actual notice to the assignee that they were assigned by the two comakers, Gillespie and Brittain, for a valuable consideration. The cause of action was bottomed solely upon the obligations evidenced by said notes. No attempt was made to state a cause of action in *assumpsit* upon an implied promise of the makers for a contribution, or upon an "heory upon which relief could have been granted. The demurrer was sustained after argument and plaintiff either refused or failed to amend the complaint within the time allowed by the court. About two March, 1927.] BAILES v. KECK. 703

months thereafter plaintiff noticed a motion for an order setting aside the order sustaining the demurrer and for leave to file a proposed amended complaint, which was in all respects identical with the original complaint except that the allegation set forth in subdivision 2, paragraph 1, of the original complaint, whereby it was alleged that upon the indorsement and delivery of said notes to plaintiff for a valuable consideration plaintiff became and had ever since been and still was the owner and holder of said notes, was omitted from the proposed amended complaint. [3] In this connection and in contradiction of the preceding allegations of the proposed amended complaint and the whole of the original complaint, it was alleged that said notes were acquired by Gillespie and Brittain for the sole purpose of transferring the same to plaintiff and that neither Gillespie nor Brittain became the holder of said notes in his own right; that said notes were not, at the time of the transfer thereof by said Farmers and Merchants Bank to Gillespie and Brittain, paid, nor have said notes at any time since said transfer by said bank been paid and neither Gillespie nor Brittain was released from the obligations upon said notes at any time by said bank and that each of them is liable thereon as a maker of said notes and "plaintiff ever since has been and still is the owner and holder thereof for the purpose of collection." The allegations by which plaintiff seeks to avoid the rule of law as to the extinguishment of obligations by the acts of comakers of a note and to hold Keck liable on the obligations which he jointly executed to the bank are nothing more than conclusions of law which cannot be permitted to supply essential allegations of fact. The allegation as to whether the bank payee was actually paid a valuable consideration for said notes by Gillespie and Brittain, as previously alleged, is equivocal and evasive. There is no positive or direct allegation in the proposed amended pleading to the effect that the obligation owing to said bank upon said notes was not in fact and truth paid and discharged before the bank surrendered its evidence of debt to said comakers of the notes. Prior allegations therein aver that the notes were indorsed by said bank and delivered to the makers Gillespie and Brittain for a valuable consideration and thereafter assigned to plaintiff for a valuable consideration. Eliminating inconsistent and contradictory averments and the failure of a positive allegation as to the 704 BAILES v. KECK. [200 Cal.
extinguishment of the obligations by payment from a consideration of the question, any other theory than that the obligation to the bank payee was discharged is highly improbable.

[4] In support of the motion to set aside the order dismissing the action plaintiff produced an affidavit of defendant Brittain, who averred that at the time of the making of the notes he was a cotrustee with defendant Keck of one or more of the Keck syndicates; that said notes were given to procure a loan of moneys to be used for the benefit of said syndicates and not for the benefit of deponent or of said Keck or any one of the trustees of said syndicates; that when said notes became due deponent caused a demand to be made upon said Keck for a payment of his proportion thereof and that said Keck refused to pay any portion thereof; that said Keck syndicates, of which deponent and Keck were trustees, were, on June 12, 1924, the date on which the complaint was filed, indebted to plaintiff, C. Sheridan Bailes, in the sum of approximately $15,000; that deponent, before filing the complaint herein, entered into an agreement with plaintiff "to cause said promissory note to be transferred to plaintiff in order that he might collect the same and in consideration thereof plaintiff agreed to credit upon his claim against said Keck syndicates any moneys received by plaintiff as the proceeds of said note"; that after the filing of the complaint deponent (Brittain), pursuant to an agreement made with counsel for plaintiff and counsel for deponent Brittain, caused a dismissal of the action to be executed and delivered to Keck's counsel; that the condition under which said dismissal was delivered was that Keck would contribute at least the sum of $3,000, or his pro rata share, toward the payment of certain indebtedness of said syndicates; that said payment was to be made out of a certain escrow then pending in Security Trust and Savings Bank, city of Los Angeles, and upon payment of said sum the attachment issued in the action would be dismissed without any claims or further demands upon either party by reason of the action or at all; that upon receiving said dismissal of the action Keck caused the same to be filed on August 11, 1924, and he thereafter refused to contribute anything toward the payment of said indebtedness of $9,000 out of said escrow or at all and refused to keep and perform the terms and conditions under March, 1927.] BAILES v. KECK. 705

which said dismissal was delivered and had deponent (Brittain) known or believed that Keck would not have kept his agreement to pay said sum of $3,000 he would not have executed or delivered said dismissal authorization to him.

We fail to find anything in the affidavit used in the motion to set aside the order of dismissal that helps the pleading or tends to excuse plaintiff's refusal to amend the pleading within the time allowed by law. The demurrer seems to have been sustained at least a month before the transaction related by deponent took place and the time in which to amend had expired. The order of dismissal, so far as we can see, had nothing whatever to do with the legal question as to the sufficiency of the complaint.

The matters set up in the affidavit seem to be in conformity with Keck's claim that Brittain had not parted with his interest in the notes and that the action, so far as the complaint shows, should have been one in contribution, rather than upon the notes. Keck filed a counter-affidavit setting up the trusteeship of himself, Brittain, Gillespie, and another of the Keck syndicates in which Brittain seemed to have had the greatest interest. Keck's affidavit avers the relationship of all the parties named in a rather complicated business proposition involving the development of oil lands and the mutual agreements entered into and breaches thereof committed by Brittain. From the recitals in the affidavits it would seem that the relations and rights of the parties therein are too complex to be determined in a simple action upon a promissory note. We do not deem it necessary to go into details as to the rights of the parties, as we have concluded that the averments and counter-averments do not present a sufficient reason to warrant us in holding that the trial court abused its discretion by refusing to set aside the order of dismissal after demurrer sustained. The court granted leave to amend in the first instance. Plaintiff declined the offer. No question of excusable neglect could, therefore, be raised. The proposed amended complaint is framed upon the same theory as the original complaint, except in the few particulars above pointed out. The judgment and orders appealed from are affirmed.

NORLAND v. GOULD.

LANGDON, J.—This is an appeal by the plaintiff from a judgment against him in an action brought to recover damages for personal injuries sustained by plaintiff Daniel Norland when he was a minor of the age of ten years. The action was brought by plaintiff by his duly appointed guardian ad litem against the Excelsior Creamery Company, the owner of an automobile truck which injured plaintiff, and George B. Gould, the driver of said truck at the time of the accident.

The plaintiff was injured while attempting to board the automobile truck, which was loaded with hay and was traveling slowly along the highway. Plaintiff's cause of action is based upon the alleged wilful and wanton negligence of the defendant Gould in omitting to use due care to avoid the injury to plaintiff.

When the cause came on for trial, the record shows that the attorney for plaintiff said: "What do I understand about the jury this morning?" to which the court replied: "Why, I understand the rule was not complied with and the money was not put up for this jury and therefore the jury was waived." Counsel attempted to persuade the court to grant a continuance and permit a jury trial, despite the asserted waiver, and the court refused to do so. There is nothing in the record which shows compliance by plaintiff with the following rule of court, which was read into the record: "In any case, other than a criminal case, the party desiring a trial by jury must, at least ten days before the day set for trial, or if the order setting the case for trial is made less than ten days before the time fixed for trial, then at the time such order is made, deposit with the clerk the sum of twenty-four dollars for the payment of jury fees. If such sum is not so deposited a trial by jury shall be deemed waived and the court will proceed to trial without a jury."

[1] Section 129 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides: "Every court of record may make rules not inconsistent with the laws of this state, for its own government of its officers. . . ." The law of the state is: "A trial by jury may be waived . . . in civil actions by the consent of the parties, signified in such manner as may be prescribed by law." (Art. I, sec. 7, Cal. Const.) 708 NORLAND v. GOULD. [200 Cal.

[2] There is nothing in the record showing a compliance by plaintiff with the foregoing rule of court, and, indeed, it is not contended upon appeal that he did comply therewith; but the contention is that he should be excused from the consequences of noncompliance. The case of *Naphtaly v. Rovegno*, 130 Cal. 639 [63 Pac. 66, 621], presents a similar point and it was there held that the appellant was not entitled to a new trial. We find no grounds for disturbing the exercise of the discretion of the trial court with reference to this matter.

[3] The trial court heard the evidence and found that the defendant Gould was operating a truck owned by the Excelsior Creamery Company at the time of the injury to plaintiff and while driving this truck along the highway he overtook plaintiff and two companions, all under the age of eleven years; that Gould did not invite the boys to get upon his truck and did not slow down to allow them to do so; that plaintiff's two companions got upon the running-board of said truck and from there climbed upon the seat and were sitting beside Gould when the accident happened; that plaintiff attempted to follow his companion and that in said attempt, while he was hanging to the side thereof, without the knowledge or consent of Gould, he fell from said truck and the rear wheel thereof passed over his foot and leg; that Gould did not discover that plaintiff was attempting to board said truck until approximately the time of the accident and too late for Gould to give any aid to plaintiff to prevent said accident; that the injury to plaintiff was not caused by the wanton or wilful or any negligence or by entire or any absence of care on the part of Gould.

Appellant insists that these findings are not sustained by the evidence. With this contention we cannot agree. Gould testified that he first saw the boys when they were attempting to catch the truck ahead of the one he was driving; that they, apparently, stepped back to the right-hand side of the road; that he called to them not to attempt to board his truck; that the truck was heavily loaded with hay. The next he saw of the children was when one of the boys was climbing up on the truck. He proceeded to scold him for boarding trucks and while doing so he caught a glimpse of plaintiff's head as he was falling down from the truck. The plaintiff testified his two companions jumped upon the March, 1927.] NORLAND v. GOULD. 709

moving truck and he was behind him. "I grabbed hold and put my knee on, this knee was on and this foot here got on a rock and tripped me. Q. Then what happened? A. Then I fell down and they ran over me."

Appellant contends that the findings show a want of care on the part of defendant which would entitle the plaintiff to recover, but it appears to us that, as a matter of fact and of law, the injury was caused by the negligence of plaintiff without any contributing factor from the defendants. A case analogous in principle to the instant case is found in *Allred v. Pioneer Truck Co.*, 179 Cal. 315 [176 Pac. 455], wherein it is said:

"At the time of the accident an employee of plaintiff was driving a furniture van, drawn by three horses, along Broadway, in the city of San Diego. As constructed, this van was an inclosed box some twelve or fifteen feet in length, six feet high and five feet in width, with a tail or end gate three feet wide, suspended by chains so that the outer edge was but two feet eight inches above the surface of the street. The van was filled with furniture, by reason of which neither the driver nor the assistant with him, occupying the front seat of the vehicle, could see the end gate upon which, unknown to them, three or four boys were riding. Melvin Allred and another lad were on their way to school, and seeing these boys on the end gate they ran to the vehicle and his companion climbed upon the end gate. Young Allred, however, ran around the side of the wagon and either in attempting to climb on the projecting end of the brake-beam or by slipping upon the wet asphaltum pavement fell in front of the hind wheel, receiving injuries which caused his death. . . .

"Construing the evidence thus summarized most strongly in favor of plaintiff we are clearly of the opinion that it is insufficient to establish any neglect of duty on the part of the defendant toward the deceased. . . . Very few vehicles operated on highways are so constructed that boys cannot climb upon them or some parts thereof, and the proposition advanced, carried to its logical conclusion, would mean that the driver of an automobile or other vehicle whose duty requires him to observe the road along which he is traveling and attend to his motive power, must be argus-eyed or accompanied by outriders charged with the duty of seeing that 710 ESTATE OF HINDE. [200 Cal.

small boys do not find lodgement upon the running-boards or other parts of the vehicle or approach a position of danger where they may, as in this case, fall under a wheel. The law does not impose such duty on one lawfully operating a vehicle along a public street."

The foregoing language is very apt in connection with the facts presented upon the record before us.

The judgment is affirmed.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Superior Court of San Diego County. W. P. Cary, Judge. Affirmed.

The facts are stated in the opinion of the court.

Sweet, Stearns & Forward for Appellants.

Eugene Daney for Respondent.

THE COURT.—This is an appeal by the above-named contestants from a judgment of nonsuit and from an order granting a new trial.

Alfred Hinde, the decedent, was a resident of and died in the county of San Diego on November 14, 1923, at the age of seventy-one years. He left surviving him as his only heirs at law certain nieces and nephews, the contestants herein. By the terms of a holographic will bearing date October 25, 1923, the decedent bequeathed all of his property to the proponent, Arthur Diederichsen, a friend of some years standing. The value of the estate is asserted to be in excess of fifty thousand dollars. Upon the petition of the sole beneficiary, who is also named therein as executor, the said will was duly admitted to probate and letters testamentary issued to him. Thereafter the appellants filed their contest urging several grounds in support of a revocation of probate. As stated in the appellants' brief the grounds of contest were:

"(1) That the will was a forgery; (2) That the testator was of unsound mind at the time of the execution of the will; (3) That the will was the result of undue influence of

5. See 26 Cal. Jur. 650; 28 R. C. L. 144. 712 ESTATE OF HINDE. [200 Cal.
Arthur Diederichsen exercised upon decedent by him when a relation of confidence and trust existed between decedent and said Diederichsen; (4) That the will was the product of a fraud practiced upon decedent by Arthur Diederichsen; (5) That the will was the result of undue influence exercised by Arthur Diederichsen; (6) That the will was mutilated, canceled and torn by decedent prior to his death, for the purpose of revoking the same." After issue joined, the cause was tried before a jury. A motion for nonsuit subsequently made on behalf of the respondent herein was granted as to all of the grounds of contest excepting that which had for its purpose an attack on the testamentary capacity of the testator. This latter issue was thereupon submitted to the jury and it returned a verdict declaring the decedent to have been of unsound mind at the time he executed his will. In conformity with the terms of said verdict judgment was entered revoking the probate of decedent's will. The trial court thereafter made its order granting the respondent's motion for a new trial upon said issue of testamentary capacity.

In support of their appeal from the judgment of nonsuit the appellants contend that evidence had been introduced by them sufficient to warrant the submission to the jury of the issues raised by the grounds of contest numbered one, three, four, five, and six. It is asserted by the contestants that the evidence adduced by them established the existence of a confidential relationship between the decedent and the respondent and an activity upon the latter's part in procuring the execution of the will, which, when considered together, were sufficient to place the burden upon the proponent of proving that the will was not induced by undue influence or fraud.

[1] We are in accord with the rule announced in Estate of Newhall, 190 Cal. 709, 719 [28 A. L. R. 778, 214 Pac. 231, 235], cited by the appellants, which upon a will contest requires that "all of the evidence in favor of the contestant must, as against a motion for a nonsuit, be taken as true, and contradictory evidence, if any, must be disregarded. This having been done, if there is any substantial evidence tending to prove the fact necessary to make out the contestant's case, the motion for a nonsuit must be denied and the case given to the jury." Application of this rule to the instant case, however, clearly indicates the correctness of the March, 1927.]                                                                                          ESTATE OF HINDE.                                                                                          713

trial court's judgment of nonsuit. [2] A painstaking research of the record fails to disclose any evidence tending to show or establish that a confidential relationship existed between the decedent and the respondent and likewise fails to reveal any evidence which would give credence to the allegations and assertions of undue influence and fraud.

Our survey of the record indicates that the decedent, a retired physician, and the respondent were intimate and warm personal friends for a number of years. On September 9, 1923, the testator became ill as a result of having partaken of tainted fowl and the respondent, upon learning of his plight, immediately attempted to alleviate his suffering. Conscious of his duty to a friend the respondent remained with the decedent at the latter's home for several nights ministering to his wants. The respondent thereafter removed the decedent to his (respondent's) home, where he could receive that care required by one so afflicted. Subsequently, and when the circumstances necessitated it, the testator was removed by the respondent to the Paradise Valley Sanitarium, where he also remained with him for several nights. His visits to the decedent at the hospital were of frequent occurrence and continued until the decedent passed away on November 14, 1923. At this point it may be remarked that the evidence discloses that all of the contestants, excepting Lillie Hinde, were residents of England. They had not seen the testator for many years and their communication with him had been confined to an occasional exchange of letters. The contestant Lillie Hinde, however, had come to the United States at the solicitation of the decedent. For a period of time they resided together. It appears from various communications addressed by the decedent to the contestants long prior to his demise that he was grieved at the treatment accorded him by said contestants, and more particularly by Lillie Hinde. In addition to this, the decedent had remarked to several witnesses that he did not want Lillie Hinde near him, as they could not live together amicably. It is also significant to note in this respect that the decedent had, approximately two weeks prior to his death, addressed a letter to the contestant Minnie Eaton in England wherein he stated that he was staying with "very dear friends who consider me one of the family & they are doing everything possible for me & are most 714 ESTATE OF HINDE. [200 Cal.
attentive to my every need & request. I've known them for years and I'm greatly indebted to them for a thousand & one kindnesses done." This same missive likewise indicated that the decedent had "dropped Lillie altogether & will not allow her to come near me" as she was "inconsiderate" and "unkind."

[3] With this picture before us it is easily understood why the testator chose to bestow his worldly accumulations upon the friend who had served him well rather than upon nieces and nephews from whom, for a long period of time, he had been disassociated if not alienated. When these matters are borne in mind there would appear to be nothing unnatural about the dispositive provisions of the decedent's will. However, even could it be said to be an unnatural will, and upon this question we express no opinion, it would be sufficient to state that a testator has the right to make an unjust, or an unreasonable, or even a cruel will, and no will may be legally set aside upon the mere establishment that it is such a will. (Estate of Smith, ante, p. 152 [252 Pac. 325]; Estate of Martin, 170 Cal. 657 [151 Pac. 138].)

[4] We are unable to conclude that the evidence introduced by the contestants is sufficient to warrant an inference that the will in question was the product of and induced by undue influence exerted by the respondent upon the testator. There is an utter lack of any proof of pressure brought to bear upon the testator which overpowered his mind and overcame his volition at the very time the will was made. (Estate of Perkins, 195 Cal. 699 [235 Pac. 45]; In re Rick's Estate, 160 Cal. 450 [117 Pac. 532].) It is necessary to show not only that undue influence has been exercised, but also that it has produced an effect upon the mind of the testator by which the will which he executes is not the expression of his own desires. [5] The presumption of undue influence is not raised by proof of interest and opportunity alone. "In order to set aside a will for undue influence, there must be substantial proof of a pressure which overpowered the volition of the testator at the time the will was made." (Estate of Bryson, 191 Cal. 521, 541 [217 Pac. 525, 533]; Estate of Newhall, 190 Cal. 709, 717 [28 A. L. R. 778, 214 Pac. 231].) In the instant case there is not, in our opinion, one iota of evidence tending to show the circumstances prevailing at the very time the will March, 1927.]                                                                                          ESTATE OF HINDE.                                                                                          715

was executed. The contestants merely have shown that the respondent at the time subsequent to the date appearing on the face of the will, and pursuant to the testator's request, attempted to have a certain attorney at law visit the testator. And that, in compliance with a second request of the decedent, the respondent succeeded in bringing said attorney to the Paradise Valley Sanitarium to see the testator on the day preceding his death. It was on the occasion of this visit that the respondent delivered the holographic will in question to the decedent, who, in turn, delivered it to said attorney for examination. Called on behalf of the contestants under section 2055 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the respondent disclaimed all knowledge of the existence or whereabouts of the will until the day preceding the testator's death when, in response to the latter's direction, he removed the will from its resting place under the mattress in the bed occupied by the decedent while staying at the respondent's home. Subsequent to a perusal of the contents of said will by the attorney of the testator's own choosing, the instrument was left by the decedent in the custody of said attorney. This evidence is uncontradicted and standing alone fails to show that the mind of the testator, at the time of making the will, was subjugated to and dominated by the desires and designs of the respondent to the point of undue influence.

Nor do we think there is any evidence which tends to support an inference that the will in question was induced by the fraudulent statements charged to the respondent. It may be conceded that the record discloses sufficient opportunity for the making of the alleged false statements. This, however, is not enough. In our opinion, there is a dearth of evidence tending to show that said false and fraudulent statements were, in fact, made.

The record is also devoid of all evidence that might tend to establish the first and sixth grounds of contest. It therefore becomes unnecessary to consider either of these grounds of contest, inasmuch as they were apparently abandoned upon the trial.

And, though the contestants filed a notice of appeal from the order granting a new trial upon the issue of testamentary capacity presented by the second ground of contest, it likewise becomes unnecessary to consider this phase of the case, for said contestants state in their brief that they "are not 716 PEOPLE v. McDONALD. [200 Cal.

For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of nonsuit and the order granting a new trial appealed from herein are, and each is, hereby affirmed.

THE COURT.—This appeal was placed upon a special calendar of this court upon an order to the respondent to

1. See 3 Cal. Jur. 1071. March, 1927.] PEOPLE v. McDONALD. 717

show cause why the judgment herein should not be reversed, or that such order be made as might be meet in the premises. At the time of the placing of said cause upon said calendar, and the entry of said order, it appeared that the appellants' brief had been filed herein, but that no brief on behalf of the respondent had been filed, although the time for the filing of such brief under the rules of this court had long since expired. In response to said order to show cause the respondent has indicated its willingness to have the matter submitted upon the appellants' brief. The appeal herein is from a judgment entered by the superior court of Kern County in an action against the appellants on an undertaking of bail executed by them in the sum of two thousand dollars. As their sole ground for reversal of said judgment the appellants urge that the complaint is fatally defective in that it fails to allege that the person for whom the undertaking of bail was executed and delivered had been released from custody. In support of this contention reliance is had on the case of *County of Los Angeles v. Babcock*, 45 Cal. 252.

[1] We have no quarrel with the doctrine enunciated in that case. It is correctly held therein that an averment of release upon or by reason of the execution and delivery of the undertaking is indispensable in an action thereon and that in the absence of such an allegation a demurrer to the complaint on that ground should be sustained. That case, however, is not decisive here. In the case of *Elizalde v. Elizalde*, 137 Cal. 634, 637 [66 Pac. 369, 70 Pac. 861, 862], this court declared: "Reversals for lack of formal allegations that might have been supplied by amendment are not favored after trial on the merits. (*Cushing v. Pires*, 124 Cal. 663 [57 Pac. 572].) And where a necessary averment has been only inferentially pleaded, it will be held sufficient after judgment and in the absence of demurrer." It is held in *Alexander v. McDow*, 108 Cal. 25, 29 [41 Pac. 24, 25], that "while a judgment will not relieve from the entire absence of a necessary averment, it will cure defects in all such averments as may by fair and reasonable intendment be found to have been pleaded, although defectively." The early case of *Hill v. Haskin*, 51 Cal. 175, 178, contains the following "Instead of alleging the fact directly it was stated only inferentially, and might have been demurred to on this ground. The defect could then have been cured by an 718 FORBELL v. PACIFIC ELECTRIC Ry. Co. [200 Cal.

amendment. But having proceeded to trial without interposing the objection it was too late afterwards for the defendant to raise the point that the offer to account ought to have been averred with greater precision and directness." Other authorities to the same effect are Houston v. Williams, 53 Cal. App. 267, 272 [200 Pac. 55]; Diamond Match Co. v. Aetna Casualty & Surety Co., 60 Cal. App. 425, 428 [213 Pac. 56]; Resetar v. Leonardi, 61 Cal. App. 765 [216 Pac. 71].

[2] The rule announced in these latter cases disposes of appellants' contention, for the complaint in the instant case, though deficient in so far as a direct averment is concerned, nevertheless, by implication, reveals that the person for whom the undertaking had been furnished had, in fact, been released from custody. This material allegation having been pleaded inferentially, it follows that the appellants, in the absence of a demurrer on that ground, are now precluded from asserting that the complaint is defective in this respect. It is true that a special demurrer was interposed in the trial court, but upon grounds not now urged.

For the foregoing reasons the judgment appealed from is hereby affirmed.

Rehearing denied.

Sarau & Thompson, Clyde Bishop and B. P. Gibbs for Appellants.

E. B. Drake for Respondent.

THE COURT.—This appeal was placed upon a special calendar of this court upon an order to the respondent to show cause why the judgment herein should not be reversed, or that such order be made as might be meet in the premises. At the time of the placing of said cause upon said calendar, and the entry of said order, it appeared that the appellant's brief had been filed herein, but that no brief on behalf of the respondent had been filed, although the time for the filing of such brief under the rules of this court had long since expired. It appears that the respondent has sold and assigned the judgment recovered herein to the First National Bank of Santa Ana, California. Upon the calling of said calendar neither the respondent nor his assignee appeared and the order to show cause was thereupon submitted. This is an appeal by the defendant Watson from a judgment entered by the superior court of the county of Los Angeles in favor of the plaintiff, Robert E. Forbell, in an action instituted to recover damages for personal injuries sustained in a collision between an electric car of the defendant Pacific Electric Railway Company and a bus operated by an employee and servant of said appellant Watson. At the time of the collision, which occurred at a point where the defendant Electric Company's line intersects a public road or highway, the injured person was a passenger in the bus of the appellant. After trial of the cause the lower court instructed the jury, as a matter of law, that the "defendant Watson is liable in the case, because the bus driver was 720 FORBELL v. PACIFIC ELECTRIC RY. Co. [200 Cal.

guilty of negligence. . . . So that . . . regardless of whether the Pacific Electric Railway is liable or not, the defendant Watson is." The court then went on to instruct, however, that it was the province of the jury to determine whether the servants of the defendant Electric Railway Company were also negligent in the operation of its car.

[1] It is contended by the appellant that the trial court erred in giving an instruction that he was "absolutely liable" because of the asserted negligence of the bus driver. We are of the opinion that this contention is meritorious. An examination of the record discloses that there is ample evidence therein tending to show that the driver of the bus stopped a short distance from the tracks of the railway and looked to the right and left before attempting to cross said tracks. The driver of the bus and a passenger sitting directly behind him both testified that they were unable, after glancing to the right and left, to see the approaching car of the defendant Electric Railway Company. In fact, the plaintiff himself testified that he was sitting on the second from the rear seat of the bus and that he did not see the approaching car until the position of the bus placed him practically on a direct line therewith, thus tending to indicate that the electric car was not discernible until the bus was well upon the tracks of the defendant Railway Company. In view of this evidence we are of the opinion that the question of fact as to the bus driver's negligence should have been submitted to the jury, and it was error for the trial court to instruct, as a matter of law, that the bus driver was negligent. The instruction complained of finds no support in the case of *Billig v. Southern Pacific Co.*, 192 Cal. 357 [219 Pac. 992], apparently relied on by the trial court in giving the same, for the circumstances in that case differed in that the automobile truck driver therein failed to "stop, look and listen" before venturing across the railroad tracks. We are not to be understood as holding, however, that the driver of the bus in the instant case was not negligent. Our conclusion is merely that this question should have been submitted to the jury. The two other grounds urged by the appellant may not properly be considered on this appeal.

For the foregoing reasons the judgment appealed from in so far as it affects the appellant Watson is hereby reversed. March, 1927.] VAN DER VLIET v. VAN DER VLIET. 721

THE COURT.—This is an appeal from an order of the superior court of the county of Los Angeles modifying a final decree of divorce. It appears that the parties hereto entered into an agreement on January 23, 1922, at which time they were living separate and apart, wherein and whereby it was agreed that the custody of their two minor children should be relinquished to and vested exclusively in the mother of the appellant herein. Subsequently, and on May 23, 1922, the appellant instituted this action for a divorce and respondent suffered her default to be taken. The interlocutory decree

1. See 9 Cal. Jur. 797; 9 R. C. L. 476.
200 Cal.—46 722 VAN DER VLIET v. VAN DER VLIET. [200 Cal.

entered in favor of the appellant was silent as to the custody of said children, the complaint not having requested relief in this respect. On October 31, 1923, a final decree of divorce was granted to the appellant and thereafter, and on January 29, 1924, the respondent filed an affidavit looking to a modification of said final decree of divorce. After hearing, the trial court made an order modifying said final decree of divorce so as to give to the respondent herein the custody of said minor children on alternate week-ends and during one-half of the regular school vacation. This appeal was thereupon prosecuted and thereafter placed upon a special calendar of this court upon an order to the respondent to show cause why said order modifying the final decree of divorce should not be reversed, or that such order be made as might be meet in the premises. At the time of the placing of said cause upon said calendar, and the entry of said order it appeared that the appellant's brief had been filed herein, but that no brief on behalf of the respondent had been filed, although the time for the filing of such brief under the rules of this court had long since expired. Upon the calling of said special calendar the order to show cause issued herein was submitted.

[1] The order of the lower court modifying the final decree of divorce so as to give the custody of the two minor children to the respondent at specified intervals of time finds support in the provisions of section 138 of the Civil Code. Applications for such modification of custody are addressed to the sound discretion of the lower court and the conclusion it reaches will not be disturbed unless the record presents a clear abuse of that discretion. (Black v. Black, 149 Cal. 224, 225 [86 Pac. 505]; Crater v. Crater, 135 Cal. 633, 634 [67 Pac. 1049]; Dickerson v. Dickerson, 108 Cal. 351, 353 [41 Pac. 475].) The power of the trial court to vary or modify its decree in divorce proceedings as to the custody, care, and education of the minor children whenever it may seem to it necessary or proper is provided for by said code section and the court is not required to award the custody of the children in conformity with an agreement of the parties as to the disposition to be made of said children. (Black v. Black, supra; Anderson v. Anderson, 56 Cal. App. 87, 89 [206 Pac. 426].) The children are not parties to the action for divorce, and the juris- March, 1927.] VAN DER VLIET v. VAN DER VLIET. 723

diction which the statute confers on the court to be exercised from time to time as changed conditions or circumstances may require, in protecting their interests, cannot be limited or abridged by the contract of the parties. Moreover, in her affidavit filed in the court below the respondent herein asserts that she did not understand the nature and effect of the agreement placing the custody of the children in their paternal grandmother. We are unable to say that the trial court abused its discretion in awarding the custody of the minor children of the parties to the respondent on alternate week-ends and during one-half of the regular school vacation.

The case of Sargent v. Sargent, 106 Cal. 541 [39 Pac. 931], cited by the appellant, is not in point. That case is properly distinguished in Black v. Black, supra, where it is said that "The contract there under consideration was one relative to the custody of the minor children provided for in the articles of separation executed by the parents pursuant to section 159 of the Civil Code, which contract the court held binding and obligatory until avoided by the mutual resumption of marital duties, or the divorce of the parties, the court further declaring, however, that 'in the event of a divorce being granted . . . the question of the custody of the minor would be left at large for the disposition of the court, the same as if the contract had not existed.'"

For the foregoing reasons the order appealed from is affirmed. SNAPP v. KIDDER.

THE COURT.—This appeal was placed upon a special calendar of this court upon an order to the respondents to show cause why the judgment herein should not be reversed, or that such order be made as might be meet in the premises.

1. See 3 Cal. Jur. 417. March, 1927.]

SNAPP v. KIDDER.

At the time of the placing of said cause upon said calendar, and the entry of said order, it appeared that the appellants' brief had been filed herein, but that no brief on behalf of the respondents had been filed, although the time for the filing of such brief under the rules of this court had long since expired. The respondents failed to appear upon the calling of said calendar and the order to show cause was thereupon submitted. There is presented herein an appeal from an order of the superior court of the county of Los Angeles refusing to dissolve an attachment. Section 537 of the Code of Civil Procedure enumerates the circumstances under which an attachment may issue upon the institution of an action. The writ of attachment complained of herein was undoubtedly issued under subdivision 1 of said section and the conflicting affidavits filed in connection with the appellants' motion to dissolve the same indicate that the controversy revolves about the question whether or not the contract out of which the debt arose was "payable in this state."

[1] It has repeatedly been held that where the right to an attachment depends upon the contract being "payable in this state" it is not enough that the money be payable wherever the defendant may be found, and therefore payable in this state, but that the contract must provide either in terms or by necessary implication that the obligation is payable in this state. (Eck v. Hoffman, 55 Cal. 501, 502; Tuller v. Arnold, 93 Cal. 166, 168 [28 Pac. 863]; Drake v. De Witt, 1 Cal. App. 617, 618 [82 Pac. 982]; Atwood v. Little Bonanza Co., 13 Cal. App. 594, 596 [110 Pac. 344]; Erickson v. Erickson, 47 Cal. App. 319, 320 [190 Pac. 464].)

[2] The instant action was instituted to recover, in the main, a sum of money alleged to be due for the use of a privilege or gambling car connected with a traveling show. By the terms of the contract between the parties, executed at East St. Louis, Illinois, the sum of $275 was to be due and payable on Wednesday of each week during the show season. It may be said, therefore, that the contract contemplated the weekly payment of said sum at such place or places as the show might be operating when the same fell due. The contract itself does not, however, indicate the places where the show visited nor does the record herein disclose that any part of the amount sued for was earned or 726 NEILSON v. HOULE. [200 Cal.

became payable in this state. This being so, it cannot be said that the obligation on any proportionate part thereof was either expressly or by necessary implication payable in this state. The writ of attachment was therefore improperly issued and the trial court erred in refusing to dissolve it.

The order appealed from is reversed.

NEILSON v. HOULE.

PRESTON, J.—This appeal presents the single issue as to whether or not we will override the judgment of the court below on the verdict of a jury rendered on conflicting evidence in an action for personal injuries.

Plaintiff's testimony showed that at the time of the accident he was proceeding at a lawful speed on the proper or right-hand side of the street, while going south on Santa Fe Avenue, in Los Angeles; that there were machines parked along the right or west side of said street, which obstructed his view of vehicles entering the street from that side; that the defendant, who had been on the premises of the Good Roads Machinery Company, on the right or west side of said avenue, suddenly entered the street immediately in front of him and was traveling in a northeasterly direction across the fifty-six foot street at a reasonable rate of speed; that plaintiff, thinking to avoid a collision, swerved to the left about ten feet, and the machine failing to slow down or stop, a collision resulted at a point near the center of the street, leaving the automobile still pointing in a northeasterly direction and diagonally across the street.

The complaint alleged negligence on the part of defendant and the answer set up negligence on the part of plaintiff as the sole cause of the accident. The evidence was sufficient to warrant the jury in finding defendant guilty of negligence in entering the street from a private entrance thereon at a point where his presence would be obscured to oncoming traffic by parked machines without taking some precaution to avoid a collision and also in not stopping his car to prevent the collision. No authorities are cited nor is there any contention made of insufficiency of the evidence, but the appeal is prosecuted upon the sole ground of inherent improbability of plaintiff's testimony. In other words, appellant appears to desire to invoke the rule of incredible testimony, which is, as stated in section 381, page 1169, of volume 10, Cal. Jur.:

"Where testimony, in the light of the undisputed facts, is so inherently improbable and impossible of belief as to, in effect, constitute no evidence at all, the rule that the amount of credit to be given to the positive testimony of any witness is solely a question for the trial tribunal, does not apply. Undoubtedly an appellate court, in reviewing the 728 NEILSON v. HOULE. [200 Cal.

evidence, is bound to exercise its intelligence, and in doing so must recognize that certain facts are controlled by immutable physical laws. . . . Even if there is a certain degree of improbability about much of the evidence that leaves it unsatisfactory to the mind of the appellate court, if it is not contradicted nor impeached except by its own weakness the decision of the lower court will not be disturbed." (See, also, *DeArellanes v. Arellanes*, 151 Cal. 443 [90 Pac. 1059], and *Austin v. Newton*, 46 Cal. App. 493 [189 Pac. 471].)

The contention of defendant, in the language of his counsel, is as follows: "That he had been in a building and that he backed his automobile out on the west side of Santa Fe avenue about 100 feet from where the accident happened and then drove directly across the street and was headed practically due north, and that his automobile was standing still on the right side of the center of the street, the way he was headed; that by reason of the roughness of the railroad track plaintiff was crossing, some 30 feet northerly from defendant's automobile and the point of collision, it caused his motorcycle to, and it did, swerve to its left and 'zig-zagged' so he struck the right front bumper of defendant's automobile headed northerly on Santa Fe avenue, to east of the center thereof, that is, on plaintiff's wrong side of the street."

[1] There is thus present a direct and sharp conflict in the evidence. There is nothing at all inherently improbable in the story of plaintiff. One or the other party must be disbelieved in a situation of this kind. The jury believed the plaintiff and rendered a verdict accordingly. The court below, being dissatisfied with the amount thereof, caused it to be reduced from $20,000 to $12,000, but no dissatisfaction was expressed as to the proof of negligence; indeed, the conclusion is certain that the court below, after modification as to damages, directly approved the verdict.

This case is well summed up in the language of *Austin v. Newton*, *supra*, at pages 497–500, as follows: "As we understand counsel's argument, what appellant does contend for is that there are certain details of the accident, as described by plaintiff and his witnesses, that are irreconcilably in conflict with certain admitted physical facts. . . . Such inconsistencies, however, would not necessarily prevent a recovery March, 1927.]

NEILSON v. HOULE.

by plaintiff. It is not to be supposed that witnesses to an accident that happens in the twinkling of an eye should accurately observe all the details. Much less is it probable that one who is injured in the accident, and rendered unconscious, should be able to give a correct account of all the quickly happening events. It cannot be laid down as a rule of law that a plaintiff in a personal injury case cannot recover unless the court can see that every detail of the accident, as testified to by the plaintiff and his witnesses, is consistent with admitted physical facts and laws of science. Undoubtedly where some of the details of an accident, as described by a witness, conflict with admitted physical facts, the whole story of the accident, as given by that witness, may be entirely discredited; but, as an appellate court, we cannot reverse unless we can say that the admitted physical facts are wholly irreconcilable with the negligence alleged in the complaint. To entitle respondent to an affirmance, it is sufficient if it can be said that, notwithstanding the admitted physical circumstances, the accident could have been caused by the negligence charged in the complaint. We hold that the reasonableness of plaintiff's version of the accident was a question of fact for the trial court, and that its finding thereon is conclusive here. . . .

[2] "Undoubtedly an appellate court, in reviewing the evidence, is bound to exercise its intelligence, and in doing so must recognize that certain facts are controlled by immutable physical laws. It cannot permit the verdict of a jury to change such facts, because, as said in Quigley v. Naughton, 100 App. Div. 476 [91 N. Y. Supp. 491], to do so would, in effect, destroy the intelligence of the court. And when the undisputed circumstances show that the story told by litigant and his witnesses cannot by any possibility be true, or when their testimony is inherently impossible, the appellate court should not hesitate to reverse the judgment, to the end that the cause again may be submitted to the determination of a jury or trial judge.

"On the other hand, as an appellate court, it is our bounden duty to exercise great care and caution in applying the tests of common sense and common knowledge of physical laws to a given state of facts. Common experience and observation teach us that strange and astonishing things sometimes happen in the world of physical phenomena, and 730 PEOPLE v. SANDOVAL. [200 Cal.

accidents sometimes appear to happen in manner unaccountable. For these reasons an appellate court must be careful not to give to dogmatic and undemonstrated conclusions respecting natural laws precedence over the testimony of apparently credible witnesses; and the mere fact that the admitted circumstances make the story of the witnesses seem improbable will not justify a reversal by an appellate tribunal upon the ground that the verdict is contrary to the evidence. (Stokes v. Metropolitan Street Ry. Co., 173 Mo. App. 676 [160 S. W. 46].) Unless, therefore, we can say that, under the undisputed physical facts, the accident could not possibly have been due to defendant's negligence as alleged in the complaint, we must affirm the judgment. It is not sufficient that the story told by plaintiff and his witnesses may be improbable. It is for the jury or the trial judge to weigh and balance probabilities. We cannot reverse upon the ground that the finding of negligence is contrary to the evidence unless we can see that the fact as found contravenes recognized physical laws, and that therefore it is impossible that the accident could have been due to the negligence alleged in the complaint.

"Tested by the foregoing, we cannot say that the finding that defendant's negligence was the proximate cause of the accident is not supported by the evidence."

The judgment is affirmed.

THE PEOPLE, etc., Respondent, v. JOSEPH SANDOVAL, Appellant.

[1] CRIMINAL LAW—MURDER—CONVICTION AND SENTENCE TO DEATH—MOTION TO SET ASIDE PROCEEDINGS—WRIT OF CORAM NONIS.—In a prosecution for murder, in which defendant was convicted of murder of the first degree with the death penalty imposed, a motion made after denial of a motion for a new trial and

1. See 8 Cal. Jur. 480; 2 R. C. L. 305. March, 1927.] PEOPLE v. SANDOVAL. 731

sentence to set aside the judgment and to return the case to the time of arraignment, as far as the legal status is concerned, is an application for a writ of coram nobis.

[2] Id.—MOTION TO SET ASIDE JUDGMENT—INSUFFICIENT SHOWING.—In a prosecution for murder, where the defendant, after a plea of not guilty, was given a full and fair trial, in which he and other witnesses for him testified, and he being represented at the arraignment and from that time on by counsel appointed for him by the court, a motion, after a verdict of murder of the first degree, denial of a motion for a new trial, and sentence of defendant to death, made by counsel appearing amicus curiae, to set aside the judgment and restore the case to its status upon arraignment, upon the ground that the defendant had plead not guilty by mistake and had desired to plead guilty, should not be granted under the circumstances, as it has no merit in law or in fact.

[3] Id.—SUFFICIENCY OF EVIDENCE.—In a prosecution for murder, where the testimony of an eye-witness to the entire tragedy was introduced, which, although containing certain inconsistencies, the jury was entitled to believe, and the confession of the defendant, several times repeated, that he had slain his common-law wife because of jealousy over her attentions to another man and of her threatened intent to leave him, which confessions were made under circumstances leaving little doubt as to their truth, were introduced in evidence, the evidence was sufficient to sustain a verdict of guilty of murder of the first degree without recommendation of the jury.

[4] Id.—FORMS OF VERDICT—SIGNING BY JUDGE BY MISTAKE.—In a prosecution for murder, where five different forms of verdict were submitted to the jury, the fact that the judge's signature had been inadvertently misplaced upon two of the forms of verdict furnished to the jury does not constitute prejudicial injury sufficient to justify a reversal of the case, where the judge read the forms of verdict to the jury and explained in his instructions the precise form of verdict which it was required to render in the five alternatives presented.

RICHARDS, J.—There are in this cause two appeals which are presented upon separate transcripts, but to be considered together. One of these is an appeal from the judgment of conviction of the defendant of the crime of murder in the first degree without recommendation by the jury and from the order denying his motion for a new trial. This appeal was taken by the defendant's regular attorneys of record acting on his behalf. The other appeal is one taken and prosecuted from an order of the trial court, made and entered after final judgment, denying a motion made on behalf of said defendant by certain counsel, appearing in the capacity of *amici curiae* for the purpose of presenting said motion on behalf of the defendant and of taking an appeal from the order of the court denying the same. We shall first in order consider the latter appeal. The facts out of which said appeal arose are these: During the trial of the cause before the superior court in and for the county of Ventura, Mr. E. S. Gardner, a member of the law firm of Drapeau, Orr & Gardner, was present in court and became apparently much moved with sympathy for the unfortunate plight in which the defendant appeared to be, and was impressed with the belief that on account of certain happenings prior to and during the course of said trial the defendant was not being accorded or receiving the full benefit of those rights and privileges to which those who are charged with and being tried for crimes are entitled. [1] Accordingly after the trial was over and after the defendant had been convicted of the crime of murder in the first degree without recommendation; and after the motion for a new trial made by his regularly appointed counsel had been denied; and after the defendant had been sentenced to suffer the March, 1927.] PEOPLE v. SANDOVAL. 733

extreme penalty of the law, Mr. Gardner, acting for his said firm of attorneys, applied to the court for and was granted permission in the capacity of *amici curiae* to present orally a motion which he denominated "a motion to set aside the judgment in this case and return the case to the time of arraignment as far as the legal status of the case is concerned." The motion, while thus denominated, was, in effect, an application for a writ, *coram nobis* and was apparently treated as such in the argument and citation of authorities by counsel in presenting the same. It is true that counsel in presenting his said motion stated that the remedy which he was seeking thereby was so broad as would if granted have enabled the defendant to go back so far in the proceedings against him as to withdraw his original plea of "Not Guilty" and to interpose a different plea; but this does not avail to change the essential nature of his motion as being in purpose and effect an application for a writ *coram nobis*. The trial court, while expressing itself in doubt as to its jurisdiction to entertain such an application, permitted said counsel to make the same and to support it with a full showing of the facts upon which it was asserted to be predicated. These facts were, briefly stated, as follows: Shortly after the arrest of the defendant for the murder of the woman with whom he was then living as his common-law wife, he stated to the arresting officers that he was "going to plead guilty and take his medicine." On several other occasions between that time and the time of his arraignment he made similar statements as to his intention to plead guilty. At the time of his arraignment the defendant was asked by the court if he had an attorney; he replied that he had not and had no means to employ an attorney, and if any attorney was to represent him the court would have to appoint one. The court thereupon appointed the firm of Pierce & Gould to represent the defendant and a continuance was had until the afternoon at the request of the defendant's said counsel. When the case was again called, both sides answering ready, Mr. Gould, of said firm, stated on behalf of the defendant that he would waive the reading of the information "and enter a plea of not guilty at this time." He further stated that "we will look into the matter very carefully and if it is advisable to change the plea at a later time we will do so." The court thereupon directed the de- 734 PEOPLE v. SANDOVAL [200 Cal.
fendant to stand up and inquired directly of him whether he waived the formal reading of the information, to which the defendant replied in the affirmative, whereupon the court stated, "You know, however, that you are charged in this information with the crime of murder, with having killed one Julia Lopez about the 27th day of June of this year; that is what is charged against you!" The defendant: "Yes sir." The court: "And to this information do you plead guilty or not guilty?" The defendant: "Not guilty for the present." The court thereupon directed the defendant's plea of "Not Guilty" to be entered and set the cause for trial for a date satisfactory to his counsel. At the time of the trial the defendant and his counsel were in court and answered ready without any attempt or suggestion of an intent to withdraw said plea. The cause proceeded to a trial before a jury extending over several days, during which the circumstances preceding and attending the homicide were fully gone over, the testimony of an eye-witness to the crime was given with the fully exercised right of cross-examination; the several confessions of the defendant were rehearsed. The defendant himself was sworn and testified on his own behalf. Certain other witnesses also testified for the defense. The cause was argued by respective counsel and was finally submitted to the jury for decision after a full set of instructions by the court had been given. In the course of giving said instructions the court read and explained to the jury five several forms of verdict, that is to say, a verdict of murder in the first degree, without recommendation; a verdict of murder in the first degree, with recommendation fixing the punishment at life imprisonment; a verdict of murder in the second degree; a verdict of manslaughter, and a verdict of not guilty. These five several forms of verdict when thus read by the court were handed to the jury. In some way not fully explained the signature of the judge had been placed upon two of these forms of verdict on the line affixed for the signature of the foreman of the jury. These two forms of verdict were those relating to the verdict of murder in the second degree and the verdict of not guilty. There is no echo in this record from the jury-room as to how that body regarded the matter of the evident misplacing of the name of the trial judge upon these two forms of verdict, but the fact is that the jury March, 1927.] PEOPLE v. SANDOVAL. 735

returned a verdict of guilty without recommendation and was duly discharged. Thereafter the court fixed the time for pronouncing judgment at several days later, at which time the defendant and his regular counsel being present in court, the defendant's motion for a new trial was duly presented in writing, setting forth seven separate grounds why such motion should be granted but setting forth no such ground as that herein urged, viz., that the defendant had mistakenly entered or had entered for him upon his arraignment a plea of not guilty. The motion for a new trial after being argued by respective counsel was denied by the court, whereupon the court proceeded to obtain such information as to the defendant's antecedents and his family as is required in certain cases under section 1192a of the Penal Code; and for that purpose placed the defendant upon the witness-stand. From the examination which then ensued it appeared that the defendant, while a Mexican as to his ancestry, was a native-born citizen of the United States of the age of forty-six years, born and reared in the county of Ventura, speaking, reading, and writing both the English and Spanish languages and having attended for a time, at least, the public schools of his native place. After these facts had been elicited from the defendant the court proceeded to pronounce sentence, in the course of which it inquired of the defendant whether he had any legal excuse to offer why the judgment of the court should not then be pronounced. The judge upon making this inquiry understood the defendant to state that he had not, and thereupon proceeded to pass judgment upon him affixing the penalty of death. Counsel of record for the defendant then gave notice of appeal, and the defendant was removed from the courtroom. Shortly thereafter, however, it was made known to the court that it had misunderstood the defendant and that he had something to say why judgment should not be pronounced. The defendant was thereupon returned to court and upon inquiry stated that he had something to say why judgment should not be pronounced; and the court, stating that it had misunderstood him, proceeded to hear his statement. The defendant then made the following statement: "Well, when I first came in here before your Honor I intended to plead guilty right here, but my attorney advised me not to, so that is the reason I did not, and I hadn't no chance to explain myself, so that is the 736 PEOPLE v. SANDOVAL. [200 Cal.
reason why I didn't spoke any more. I told Mr. Suytar when he took me up there that I wanted to plead guilty and save the expense of the county. . . . What I mean is that I just wanted to plead guilty as soon as I came before you, and I was advised not to, and that is how I stood trial." The court upon hearing the foregoing statement replied that it furnished no legal excuse which would give the court authority or power to stay the imposition of the judgment, and that the judgment as pronounced would stand. It then repeated the substantial portion of its former judgment affixing the death penalty, and noted the defendant's appeal to the supreme court. At the afternoon session of the court Mr. Gould, representing his firm, arose in court to ask the court to dismiss his firm from the case upon the ground that the defendant, having at the morning session of court made a statement indicating that he was dissatisfied with his attorneys, it might be possible that he would wish through other attorneys to urge executive clemency on account of their handling of his case. The court stated that he knew of no misconduct on the part of counsel and had no disposition to relieve them of their further duties in or connected with the case, but, on the other hand, suggested that they continue to take every legal step required to perfect an appeal and preserve to the defendant every right of appeal which he might have. [2] Several days later Mr. E. S. Gardner appeared in court to state that moved by his sympathy for the defendant and under the belief that he had not been accorded all of his rights in the premises he would ask permission as amicus curiae and on the defendant's behalf to move to set aside the judgment and restore the cause to the condition in which it stood when the defendant was arraigned, in order that the defendant might withdraw his plea of not guilty and present a plea of guilty as he had at first intended. The court permitted Mr. Gardner, or rather his firm, to act as such amici curiae in the premises and to present such motion, though doubtful of its jurisdiction to hear and determine the same. Whereupon all of the foregoing facts were fully presented to the court and the matter being then argued and submitted to the court for its decision, the court rendered its decision as follows: "So far as this matter is concerned, I do not see that it effects the defendant one way or the other; and on the merits of the March, 1927.] PEOPLE v. SANDOVAL. 737

motion Mr. Gardner has made, I have given it a good deal of consideration, and while I have no doubt in my own mind that the statements of the witnesses as to the declarations made by the defendant with reference to his intention to plead guilty and his desire to plead guilty in this case are true, and that he said he was persuaded or prevented by his counsel from doing so, and that the defendant made those statements or declarations as and when testified to by the witnesses, as a legal proposition I cannot see that the Court has any power to interfere with the situation even if we were to reach the conclusion that the Court should so interfere. The defendant was represented by counsel and a trial was had, I believe a fair and impartial trial, and the defendant submitted himself to this tribunal, and I know of no authority in the Court at this time to set aside his judgment or to permit now a withdrawal of the plea of not guilty and the interposition of a plea of guilty, and the motion will have to be denied."

It is from the foregoing order that the second appeal herein has been taken. There is no merit either as a matter of law or as a matter of fact upon the record before us in the contentions of counsel acting as *amici curiae* upon this second appeal. The case of *People v. Perez*, 9 Cal. App. 265 [98 Pac. 870], even if regarded as authority for such a proceeding in cases where no trial of the defendant had been had but a plea had been obtained by some character of duress or the trial was affected by some outside force, has no application to the facts of the instant case wherein no duress of any kind was exercised and where the defendant's trial had been regular in all respects. The very limited class of cases to which the writ of *coram nobis* would be applicable under our statutory forms of procedure, of which it has never been expressly made a part, was very fully considered by this court in the cases of *People v. Mooney*, 178 Cal. 525 [174 Pac. 325], and *People v. Reid*, 195 Cal. 249 [36 A. L. R. 1435, 232 Pac. 457], and it is clear that under these authorities the trial court properly denied this application, considered as an application for a writ *coram nobis*. And, if said application were to be considered as an application for any other or broader remedy than that strictly permissible under *coram nobis*, it would also have been properly denied upon the ground that the facts were

200 Cal.—47 738 PEOPLE v. SANDOVAL. [200 Cal.

fully known and the remedies fully available to the defendant upon his motion for a new trial and upon his appeal from the order denying such motion. (People v. McCoy, 71 Cal. 395, 398 [12 Pac. 272]; Wood v. Moulton, 146 Cal. 317, 322 [80 Pac. 92].) An examination of the record upon the first appeal discloses that the contention that the defendant was injuriously affected by the fact that the name of the trial judge was inadvertently affixed to certain of the forms of verdict above adverted to is fully presented and argued upon that appeal and will be there given due consideration. For the foregoing reasons the second appeal herein is dismissed.

[3] As to the first or main appeal of the defendant from the judgment of conviction and order denying a new trial herein it requires but brief attention. There is no merit in the appellant's contention that the evidence in the case was insufficient to sustain the verdict. Aside from the fact that there was an eye-witness to the entire tragedy, whose testimony, notwithstanding certain inconsistencies, the jury was entitled to believe, there was also the confession several times repeated by the defendant that he had slain his common-law wife because of jealousy over her attentions to another man and of her threatened intent to leave him, which confessions were made under circumstances which left little doubt as to their truth. These fully justify the verdict of the jury even conceding the state of intoxication in which the defendant may have been when he came to the actual moment for the commission of his crime, and which in itself furnishes no excuse for its perpetration. (Sec. 22, Pen. Code; People v. Sainz, 162 Cal. 242, 245 [121 Pac. 922]; People v. Yeager, 194 Cal. 452, 474 [229 Pac. 40]; People v. Casade, 194 Cal. 679, 687 [230 Pac. 9].) [4] As to the final contention of the defendant that he sustained some prejudicial injury from the fact that the judge's signature had been inadvertently misplaced upon two of the forms of verdict furnished to the jury, we are unable to perceive enough of merit to justify a reversal of this cause. The jury had already had read and explained to it in the court's instructions the precise form of verdict which it was required to render in the five alternatives presented to it in arriving at its verdict. Having been so explicitly advised its members as intelligent men could not well have been March, 1927.]

McKEON v. SAMBRANO.

misled by the presence upon one or more of these forms of verdict of the name of the judge in a place thereon where it had no reasonable business to be. To strike out the misplaced name of the judge and insert the name of the foreman of the jury in case that body had agreed upon either of said forms of verdict would have been the altogether reasonable thing to do; while the substitution instead of the most drastic form of verdict submitted to it would be the altogether unreasonable thing for the jury to do unless its members were agreed upon that extremer form of verdict, in which event it would be quite immaterial what the rejected forms of verdict contained.

We perceive no error in this record. The judgment and order are affirmed.

MOTION to dismiss an appeal from a judgment of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County. E. P. Shortall, Judge Presiding. Denied; motion to recall *remittitur* denied; motion to affirm judgment granted.

The facts are stated in the opinion of the court.

John Lapique, *in pro. per.*, for Appellant.

Gus Hagenstein for Respondent.

THE COURT.—Three motions are presented herein for determination. The respondent has made a motion to dismiss the appeal from the judgment and a motion to affirm said judgment. The appellant, while opposing these motions, presents on his own behalf a motion to recall the *remittitur* heretofore issued by the clerk of this court upon the dismissal of four appeals from orders after judgment.

A summary statement of a few pertinent facts will be conducive to a proper understanding of the questions of law presented by these several motions. It appears that the appellant at one time had pending herein five appeals from as many orders entered by the trial court in this foreclosure proceeding. One of these several appeals was from the judgment and decree of foreclosure while the remaining four were from orders made and entered after said judgment. Upon the calling of the December calendar of this court the respondent made a motion, upon enumerated grounds, for the dismissal of all five of said appeals. The record indicates that the appellant failed to appear in opposition to said March, 1927.] McKEON v. SAMBRANO. 741

motion and the same was thereupon granted as to the four appeals from the orders after judgment but denied as to the appeal from the judgment. At the next succeeding session of this court, held in March of this year, the respondent repeated his motion to dismiss the appeal from the judgment and, as stated above, also presented a motion for the affirmance of said judgment. The appellant, who appears herein *in propria persona*, was present in court upon the making of these latter motions and opposed the granting thereof. At this same time he made the motion, above referred to, for recall of the *remittitur* issued upon the earlier dismissal of the four appeals from the orders after judgment, urging in support thereof that he had not received notice of the making of the motion at the preceding session of the court and that the order of this court made at such time dismissing his said four appeals was secured by reason of fraud and imposition having been practiced by the respondent's counsel in having filed herein a false and fraudulent affidavit of mailing.

[1] In our opinion the appellant has failed to establish that the affidavit of mailing is false and fraudulent. There is nothing in the record herein which would tend to indicate that the notice of motion was not in fact properly addressed and mailed to the appellant. The mere circumstance that the appellant might not have received said notice of motion through the mail cannot lend support to his claim that the affidavit of mailing is false and fraudulent. Section 1012 of the Code of Civil Procedure indicates the circumstances under which service may be made by mail and section 1013 of the same code provides, among other things, that "the service is complete at the time of the deposit" in the mail. In *Heinlen v. Heilbron*, 94 Cal. 636, 640 [30 Pac. 8], this court declared that "The service by mail authorized by section 1012 does not contemplate a delivery as a part of the service, as is seen by the provision of section 1013 that 'the service is complete at the time of the deposit' in the post-office.'" Other cases in which it has been held that service by mail is complete at the time of deposit in the postoffice and that the addressee incurs the risk of the failure of the mail are: *Griffin v. Board of Commrs.*, 20 S. D. 142 [104 N. W. 1117, 1119]; *Batchoff v. Butte etc. Co.*, 60 Mont. 179 [198 Pac. 132, 135], and *Jacobs v. Hooker*, 1 Barb. (N. Y.) 742 MCKEON v. SAMBRANO. [200 Cal.

71. A perusal of the affidavit of mailing filed by respondent's counsel reveals that "the case is one in which such service is permitted, and that the mode pointed out by the statute for making such service has been strictly followed." (Heinlen v. Heilbron, supra.) The appellant's motion to recall the *remittitur* heretofore issued is therefore denied.

[2] This brings us to a consideration of the respondent's motion to dismiss the appeal from the judgment. In this connection it may be said that this motion appears to be but a renewal of the motion denied at the December session of the court. We perceive of no reason why the present motion should not also be denied, for it is grounded, as was the earlier motion, upon the claim that the appellant has failed to file herein a full and complete phonographic report of the trial. The transcript, however imperfect, contains the judgment-roll, and the appeal from the judgment having been taken under the alternative method may not be dismissed upon the ground that the "Reporter's Transcript" is incomplete. (Locke-Paddon v. Locke-Paddon, 194 Cal. 73, 77 [227 Pac. 715]; Ramsay v. Rodgers, 189 Cal. 100 [207 Pac. 516]; Beckett v. Stuart, 35 Cal. App. 796 [171 Pac. 107].) It follows, therefore, that the respondent's motion to dismiss the appeal from the judgment must be and the same is denied.

[3] There remains to be considered the respondent's further motion for affirmance of the judgment upon the ground that the appeal therefrom is a frivolous appeal. It is the practice of this court ordinarily to deny a motion for affirmance of the judgment appealed from for the very good reason that consideration of such a motion necessarily involves an examination of the record and briefs of counsel as to the merits of the appeal resulting in the advancement of the hearing of the particular appeal over many other appeals preceding it on our calendar. Such a course would obviously be unfair to other litigants in this court whose appeals are entitled to priority in the matter of hearing. (Chino Land etc. Co. v. Hamaker, 171 Cal. 689, 690 [154 Pac. 850].) We are of the opinion, however, in view of the several and oft-repeated motions presented herein which have to some extent familiarized us with the issues involved in this litigation, that this particular motion for affirmance of the March, 1927.]

DOWNS v. KROEGER.

judgment may properly be considered without doing substantial injustice to other litigants.

An examination of the appellant's brief discloses that he is urging as grounds for reversal matters which, with one exception, were covered by the four appeals heretofore dismissed by this court. It thus appears that the appellant is attempting to prosecute the instant appeal, in the main, upon grounds not properly reviewable under it and which grounds have already been disposed of by the order of this court dismissing his four appeals abortively prosecuted from the orders after judgment. The only ground now urged for a reversal which has not at one time or another during the history of this litigation received the attention of the court is the contention that the complaint fails to state a cause of action and that the appellant's demurrer thereto was improperly overruled. A mere cursory glance at the complaint sufficiently indicates the correctness of the trial court's order. The appeal is clearly without merit and is a frivolous appeal. The judgment is, therefore, affirmed.

LUELLA E. DOWNS et al., Appellants. v. J. L. KROEGER, Respondent.

[1] DEEDS—BUILDING RESTRICTIONS—CHANGE OF NEIGHBORHOOD.—Where a tract of land was subdivided and laid out for residential purposes and restrictive covenants running with the land were inserted in all deeds by which parts of said tract were conveyed, prohibiting until a certain time the construction of any structure but residences in the restricted area, a change in the uses to which the property in the neighborhood is being put of such nature that it is no longer residence property renders it unjust, oppressive, and inequitable to give effect to the restrictions, if such change has resulted from causes other than their breach.

[2] ID.—INJUNCTION.—In such a case an injunction will not issue to restrain the defendant from completing a store building upon his lot, where the evidence shows, and the court finds, that defendant's property is essentially business property, and that

PRESTON, J.—Plaintiffs instituted this action for a permanent injunction to restrain defendant from completing a store building upon lot 27, block 9, in tract 2072, commonly known as Wellington Square, situate in the city of Los Angeles, said tract consisting of approximately eight contiguous blocks, forming a rectangular-shaped area containing 397 lots. In the year 1912 it was subdivided and laid out for residential purposes, restrictive covenants running with the land being inserted in all deeds by which parts of said tract were conveyed, prohibiting until the year 1960 the construction of any structures but residences in the restricted area. Said lot 27 is a border lot which abuts West Adams Street and faces an unrestricted area. It was purchased by defendant in 1920 and he concedes the validity of the restrictive covenants and that he took said lot subject thereto.

Plaintiffs, owners of certain lots in the tract, allege that the erection of a store building on said lot by defendant would be in violation of said restrictive covenants; would March, 1927.]

depreciate the value of plaintiffs' property and lower the class of the neighborhood, all to their damage.

Defendant contends that the character of the surrounding neighborhood has so changed that the property was and is essentially business property, and as a result the covenants and restrictions relied upon by plaintiffs have become ineffective and their enforcement would be inequitable, unjust, and oppressive.

The trial court, after hearing the evidence and inspecting the locality, denied the relief prayed for and plaintiffs have taken this appeal from the judgment, urging that said restrictions are for the benefit of all owners in said tract and of substantial value to the dominating lots therein; that changed conditions in the neighborhood, or even the fact that defendant's property may have become more valuable for business purposes, are immaterial and not a defense to an action for injunction, and furthermore that no such changed conditions are in fact shown by the evidence.

Respondent contends that the equitable remedy by injunction will not be granted where the condition of the property is so altered as to render it unfit for the purposes for which it was originally designed and that the enforcement of the restrictions would result in slight, if any, benefit to plaintiffs, but would work great and irreparable hardship upon respondent.

The court, among other things, found that although the permitting of said structure for the purpose stated was contrary to said restrictions, it would not greatly or at all depreciate the value of plaintiffs' property or lower the general class and character of the neighborhood; nor would plaintiffs suffer damage of any character thereby.

That in 1920, when said lot was purchased by defendant, no improvements of any character existed on Adams Street for a distance of several blocks, but within the past three years that section of Adams Street had become a business section and many stores and business structures had been built, including three buildings occupied by building contractors and real estate brokers; a building for business occupied by a real estate broker, a shoemaker, and a restaurant; and other structures occupied by a grocery store, a meat market, and a hardware store. 746 Downs v. Kroeger. [200 Cal.

That by reason of the construction of business buildings defendant's lot is no longer suitable or desirable for residential purposes and is essentially business property and located in a section devoted exclusively to business purposes; that the construction and use of a business building on the lot of defendant will not injure or damage the property of plaintiffs or the owner of any other lot in said tract 2072, but if defendant is restrained from using his property for the only purpose for which it is now suitable and available, he will be irreparably damaged and deprived of any use whatsoever of said property.

That by reason of the changed conditions in the neighborhood occurring since said restrictions were imposed, it would be inequitable to enforce them against the use of said property as contemplated by defendant.

A careful review of the evidence and an inspection of the several exhibits introduced at the trial clearly indicate, in our opinion, that it is amply sufficient to support the findings, and the further fact may be noted that the trial court had previously inspected the locality for a better understanding of the testimony.

Respondent testified that at the time he purchased the lot there was a big Chinese vegetable garden on the south side of the street, and the whole tract did not have a building on it; that during the year preceding the trial some business buildings had been constructed in the unrestricted area; that it would not pay to put a residence on his lot and that the lot would be better adapted for business.

Nathan Levin, a resident of the northeast corner of Adams and Buckingham Streets, testified that three store buildings had been erected across the street, occupied by a laundry, silk store, cleaning and pressing place, real estate office, and church; also as to grocery and drugstore in the adjoining blocks.

On cross-examination he testified that he paid ten thousand two hundred dollars for his place and on redirect that as business property, without restrictions, the lot alone would be worth twelve thousand dollars; that on account of the street-car line on Adams Street and the traffic and rubbish it is unfit for residences and no place to keep children.

E. S. Butterworth testified that the property was more adaptable and valuable for business purposes and not rea- March, 1927.]

747

sonably fit for residential purposes; that he did not think lifting the restrictions on this block would depreciate the value of the rest of the tract.

Frank D. Tatum, a real estate broker, testified that Adams Street had changed into a business street and that the remaining vacant property was only fit for business purposes and absolutely useless for residences.

The only witnesses called in rebuttal by appellants, Charles E. Ott, the real estate broker who assisted in subdividing Wellington Square, and John H. Albright, a builder and contractor residing therein, merely testified that in their opinion the lifting of the restrictions would depreciate the value of the property in the tract.

[1] The authorities unquestionably support the conclusion of the trial court in holding that where there has been a change in the uses to which the property in the neighborhood is being put, so that such property is no longer residence property, it would be unjust, oppressive, and inequitable to give effect to the restrictions, if such change has resulted from causes other than their breach.

"It is evident that the purpose of the restrictions as a whole was to make the locality a suitable one for residences; and that, owing to the general growth of the city, and the present use of the whole neighborhood for business, this purpose can no longer be accomplished. If all the restrictions imposed in the deeds should be rigidly enforced, it would not restore to the locality its residential character, but would merely lessen the value of every lot for business purposes. It would be oppressive and inequitable to give effect to the restrictions, and, since the changed condition of the locality has resulted from other causes than their breach, to enforce them in this instance could have no other effect than to harass and injure the defendant, without effecting the purpose for which the restrictions were originally made (citing cases)." (Jackson v. Stevenson, 156 Mass. 496, 502 [32 Am. St. Rep. 476, 31 N. E. 691, 693].)

"It certainly is not the doctrine of courts of equity, to enforce, by its peculiar mandate, every contract, in all cases, even where specific execution is found to be its legal intention and effect. It gives or withholds such decree according to its discretion, in view of the circumstances of the case, and the plaintiff's prayer for relief is not answered, where, under 748 Downs v. Kroeger. [200 Cal.

those circumstances, the relief he seeks would be inequitable. (Peters v. Delaplaine, 49 N. Y. 362; Margraf v. Muir, 57 N. Y. 155; Mathews v. Terwilliger, 3 Barb. (N. Y.) 51; Radcliffe v. Warrington, 12 Ves. (Eng.) 331.) If for any reason, therefore, not referable to the defendant, an enforcement of the covenant would defeat either of the ends contemplated by the parties, a court of equity might well refuse to interfere or if in fact the condition of the property by which the premises are surrounded has been so altered 'that the terms and restrictions' of the covenant are no longer applicable to the existing state of things. (1 Story's Equity Jurisprudence, 10th ed., sec. 750.) And so, though the contract was fair and just when made, the interference of the court should be denied, if subsequent events have made performance by the defendant so onerous, that its enforcement would impose great hardship upon him, and cause little or no benefit to the plaintiff." (Trustees of Columbia College v. Thacher, 87 N. Y. 311, 317 [41 Am. Rep. 365, 367].)

"Under the circumstances now existing the covenant is no longer effective for the purpose in view by the parties when they made it, and the enforcement thereof cannot restore the neighborhood to its former condition by making it desirable for private residences. If the building restrictions were of substantial value to the dominant estate, a court of equity might enforce it even if the result would be a serious injury to the servient estate, but it will not extend its strong arm to harm one party without helping the other, for that would be unjust. An injunction that bears heavily on the defendant without benefiting the plaintiff will always be withheld as oppressive." (McClure v. Leaycraft, 183 N. Y. 36, 44 [5 Ann. Cas. 45, 75 N. E. 691, 693].)

The evidence, in our opinion, is sufficient, within the rule as announced by the above authorities, to show such a change in the character of the locality as to warrant an equity court in refusing to enjoin a violation of the restrictive covenants, and supports the findings and judgment.

[2] There remains the further contention of appellants that the fact that defendant's property has become more desirable or valuable for business than for residence purposes is not a defense to an action for injunction and that its value for business purposes is immaterial, in support of which they rely largely upon the case of Miles v. Clark, 44 March, 1927.]

DOWNS v. KROEGER.

Cal. App. 539–549 [187 Pac. 167]. That case is not in point as the evidence here shows, and the court found, that defendant's property is essentially business property, and if he is restrained from using it for the only purpose for which it is now suitable and available, he will be irreparably damaged and deprived of any use whatsoever thereof. In other words, that defendant's property is "absolutely useless for residence purposes." (Testimony of Mr. Tatum.)

It is stated in the case of *Miles v. Clark, supra*, that "where there has been a change in the uses to which property in the neighborhood is being put, so that such property is no longer residence property, it would be oppressive and inequitable to give effect to restrictions where the changed conditions of the locality has resulted from other causes than their breach. (*Los Angeles Terminal Land Co. v. Southern Pacific R. R.*, 136 Cal. 36 [68 Pac. 308]; *Trustees of Columbia College v. Thacher*, 87 N. Y. 311 [41 Am. Rep. 365]; *Jackson v. Stevenson*, 156 Mass. 496 [32 Am. St. Rep. 476, 31 N. E. 691].)" The evidence and the findings in that case, however, showed no unfavorable change in the tract or its vicinity and the above doctrine was held inapplicable there.

The question of damage to appellants is disposed of by the cases above cited and in the finding, supported by the evidence, that appellants will not suffer any damage whatsoever from completion of defendant's building.

It is proper to note in disposing of the appeal in this case that we are by no means intending to establish a precedent in cases of this general character, where the facts and circumstances distinguish them from the case before us. Nor does it by any means follow that the integrity and validity of the restrictions obtaining as to other property in this subdivision will necessarily be affected in any manner or at all by the conclusion herein announced. The findings of the court below under the evidence are binding upon us and we have simply adhered to the well-known rule of law governing us in such a situation.

[3] Appellants also make some objection to the form of the judgment, claiming that it exceeds the findings. It appears to be supported by the findings when examined and considered with the record as a whole and it can only be construed to harmonize with them. "In determining the 750 DOWNS v. KROEGER. [200 Cal.
scope and effect of the judgment the entire judgment-roll may be looked to for the purpose of its interpretation." (Freeman v. Donohoe, 188 Cal. 170, 172 [204 Pac. 593].) Judgment affirmed.

Shenk, J., Seawell, J., and Langdon, J., concurred.

RICHARDS, J., Dissenting.—I dissent. The tract known as "Wellington Square," lying along the Wellington Road about five miles from the heart of the city of Los Angeles, was laid out, subdivided, and sold about fourteen years ago as a restricted residence district, to be used for residence purposes only, as expressed in the deeds to purchasers of residence lots therein. These deeds contained the covenant "That no apartment house, flat, lodging house, store, hotel or any other than a first-class private residence, with or without the customary outbuildings, including a private stable or garage, shall be erected, placed or permitted on said land or any part thereof." There were further specific restrictions touching the minimum cost of residences to be erected therein, their distance from the front line of the premises, regulating the location of outbuildings and the height of hedges, fences, copings, or walls, and prohibiting signboards, advertising boards or banners within said restricted area. The lots and tracts of land therein were sold to many purchasers, subject to the foregoing restrictions of the deeds of each, including the defendant herein, and these purchasers or their transferees have during the intervening years proceeded to build their residences and homes thereon and therein until practically the entire area thereof has been built up residentially, and until, as a matter of common knowledge, and as the exhibits and photographs appended to the transcript herein disclose, Wellington Square has become and now is one of the most beautiful and attractive exclusively residence areas within the city of Los Angeles. Heretofore and until this defendant conceived the idea that it would be more profitable to him to violate than to continue to comply with the covenants, conditions, and restrictions upon which he was permitted to purchase his lot within said area, no other attempted breach thereof has occurred. His sole excuse for his breach of the express conditions, covenants, and restrictions of his grant is that the March, 1927.]

DOWNE v. KROEGER.

lands and lots of an adjoining tract across the street from one side of this restricted area, and which constitutes an unrestricted area, are being devoted in part to business purposes. There is no evidence in the case showing that the other three sides of this restricted subdivision have been invaded by business or are other than residential in character, nor is there any evidence that the unrestricted tract on Adams Street opposite the defendant's lot has been wholly devoted to business establishments. In fact, the evidence is to the contrary. We have the condition as shown by the practically undisputed evidence wherein the defendant, because some places of business have been erected in an unrestricted area across the street from him, claims the right to put a store upon his lot within the restricted area, in violation of the covenants and restrictions of his deed, the effect of which, if permitted, will inevitably be to open the way to such an invasion of Wellington Square by stores, garages, service stations, apartment and lodging houses and other forbidden structures and uses as would ere long entirely destroy the restrictive covenants upon which residential owners of property within this area purchased and have improved and enjoyed their restrictive holdings therein. No case that has been cited in the main opinion and none that I have seen has gone to this extent before in permitting a single owner within a restricted area to not only violate his own covenants but to destroy the essential covenants, prohibitions, and securities of his co-owners simply because other persons have put stores and shops in an unrestricted area across the street from his lot and thus made it more profitable to himself to put his lot to like uses in violation of the terms, covenants, and restrictions of his deed. It is just this to which the main opinion herein gives its sanction. The case of Jackson v. Stevenson, 156 Mass. 496 [32 Am. St. Rep. 476, 31 N. E. 691], from which the main opinion quotes as sustaining its doctrine, does not support it. It refers to the "present use of the whole neighborhood for business" and to the loss by the "locality of its residential character." The term "locality" as employed in the quoted portion of said case evidently means "the restricted locality." This case has no semblance as to its facts to the case at bar. The case of Trustees, etc., v. Thacher is equally inapplicable to the in- 752 DOWNS v. KROEGER. [200 Cal.

stant situation, since the court found not only that "the general current of business affairs had reached and covered the entire premises," but also found the construction and operation of an elevated railway alongside the restricted district, which had the effect of producing a large depreciation in rents and frequent vacancies. The case of *Miles v. Clark*, 44 Cal. App. 539, 549 [187 Pac. 167], states, in my opinion, the correct rule as to the effect to be given to changes in the use of property in the neighborhood where no radical change in the restricted tract is shown. In that case, as in this, the tract in question had been subdivided and sold under similar restrictions contained in the conveyances to purchasers who had built upon and occupied their respective holdings as strictly residential properties. In that case, as in this, the defendants were found to be holding their property subject to such restrictions. In that case, as in this, the defendants were seeking to avoid the binding force of such restrictions and to put their property to business uses, upon the claim that the character of other property in the vicinity of the tract had so changed through the erection of apartment houses and business establishments that it would be inequitable to enforce such restrictions against a like use of the defendants' property. The appellate court dealing with that situation said: "The fact that apart from and surrounding the tract some business has grown up and that the land has become more valuable in consequence in no manner entitles the defendants to be relieved from the restrictions they have created. This condition is but the natural result of the improvement of the various tracts, and the fact that the property may have become more valuable thereby for business purposes is immaterial. (Citing cases.) Courts in such cases are not controlled exclusively by money value, but may protect a home." The fundamental error of the trial court as to the rule applicable to cases of this character lies in its holding that when the property of the individual owner has been so far affected by conditions existing in contiguous unrestricted territory as to be less valuable to him for residential than for business purposes he is no longer bound by the conditions and restrictions of his deed. Such is not the rule under the practically unanimous current of authority which holds that it is only when the character of the restricted March, 1927.]

DOWNS v. KROEGER.

753

region as a whole so far changes as to render it no longer adaptable to restricted residential uses that the right to be relieved from such restrictions can arise. There is no finding in this case that such a condition exists within the restricted area as a whole, but only as to the eight lots therein fronting on Adams Street. As to all the rest of the tract the finding is that "said eight lots are the only lots in said tract which are affected by the changed conditions on said Adams Street." It follows that the remaining 389 lots in the Wellington Square tract still retain their residential character, but have lost the restrictive protection. Such is the inevitable result of the decision of the trial court, to which the majority opinion herein lends its approval. The principles laid down in *Martin v. Holm*, 197 Cal. 733 [242 Pac. 718], touching the sacredness of the reciprocal covenants of owners in restricted areas should be given application to the case at bar, and so applied would operate to prevent the single owner of a lot in this restricted area from doing that with his property which will eventuate in the destruction of the restrictive benefits and protection of all of his co-owners therein. That such will be the result if this judgment is to stand was aptly indicated by Mr. Justice Lennon in the case of *Miller v. Board of Public Works*, 195 Cal. 477 [234 Pac. 381], wherein he points out that once the restrictive covenants of the home owner are broken down his only recourse is to move to another location and by so doing be compelled to abandon the benefits emanating from a permanent home site. Such, in my opinion, would be the effect of the affirmance of the judgment herein.

The trial court fell into another fundamental error which the main opinion herein would perpetuate. It is the error that the plaintiffs, seeking to enforce a building restriction against the defendant equally bound to conform to its covenant, but refusing to do so, must allege and prove damage before they can obtain an injunctive remedy. The rule is just the contrary. The damage resulting to the plaintiffs and their co-owners in the restricted area from an unjustified breach of covenants such as these is of necessity both irremediable and impossible of ascertainment, since they relate to the comfortable enjoyment of homes secluded from business in the restricted region. The trial court was, therefore, in error in denying the plaintiffs injunctive relief upon

200 Cal.—48 754 DE LA TORRE v. JOHNSON. [200 Cal.

the ground that no damage had been shown. Such a conclusion was contrary to its own finding upon the undisputed evidence herein that the residential character of this restricted area as a whole had not undergone a change. It follows necessarily that for the foregoing fundamental errors the judgment herein should be reversed.

Curtis, J., and Waste, C. J., concurred.

Rehearing denied.

ALBERT DE LA TORRE, Appellant, v. W. P. JOHNSON et al., Respondents.

[1] NEGLIGENCE—ACTION FOR DAMAGE—DEATH OF TORT-FEASOR—ABATEMENT OF ACTION—APPEAL.—A person who suffers a personal injury in the course of his employment at the hands of a tort-feasor who is not his employer cannot, after a judgment rendered against him in the lower court in a suit to recover damages from said tort-feasor, continue to prosecute an appeal pending in the supreme court, after the death of said tort-feasor, as such an action, both at common law and under the general provisions of the statutes of this state, abates upon the death of the tort-feasor.

[2] Id.—PERSONAL INJURIES—DEATH OF PARTIES—ABATEMENT OF ACTION.—The general rule is that a cause of action for personal injuries, in the absence of a statute expressly providing to the contrary, abates upon the death of either the person injured or the tort-feasor.

[3] Id.—WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION, INSURANCE AND SAFETY ACT—CONSTRUCTION.—The contention that section 26 of the Workmen's Compensation, Insurance and Safety Act (Stats. 1917, p. 831) authorizes the continuance of an action to recover damages for personal injuries made compensable under the provisions of said act, which are caused by the negligence of a tort-feasor other than the employer, after the death of said negligent third party, by the substitution of his personal representatives, cannot be maintained.

[4] Id.—RIGHTS AGAINST TORT-FEASOR.—The Workmen's Compensation, Insurance and Safety Act does not attempt or purport to grant any right against a tort-feasor to the person who, at the time of the injury, was an employee of a third person that is not accorded to every other member of society similarly situated with respect to casualties which have no relation to the status of employer and employee.

[5] Id.—CONSTRUCTION OF ACT.—The portion of section 26 of the Workmen's Compensation, Insurance and Safety Act reading, "The death of the employee, or any other person, shall not abate any right of action established by this section," must be construed in connection with and with reference to the subject matter of the act and its manifest object, and its sole and primary object is to fasten a liability on "all employers to compensate their employees for any injury incurred by said employees in the course of their employment, irrespective of the fault of either party."

[6] Id.—COMPENSATION—DAMAGES—RIGHT OF ACTION.—The compensation provided in the Workmen's Compensation, Insurance and Safety Act is not damages in the sense that the latter term is used in ordinary tort actions; and the right to recover damages for personal injuries is not a right of action established by said act, but a common-law right established long before the adoption of said act.

[7] Id.—RIGHT OF ACTION BY EMPLOYER.—The right of the employer to prosecute a suit against the tort-feasor to recover any compensation which he has paid or has become obligated to pay is a new right created by the Workmen's Compensation, Insurance and Safety Act.

Pillsbury, Madison & Sutro and Edwin V. McKenzie for Executor of Will of Respondent Johnson.

Hudson, Martin & Jorgensen for Respondent Smith.

SEAWELL, J.—[1] The question presented by this motion to substitute in the place of defendant Johnson the executor of his estate and to continue the action against said executor as a defendant and the counter-motion to dismiss the appeal herein, is whether or not a person who suffers a personal injury in the course of his employment at the hands of a tort-feasor who is not his employer may, after a judgment rendered against him in the court below, continue to prosecute an appeal pending in this court after the death of said tort-feasor in the absence of express statutory provisions authorizing the continuance of the proceeding. Both at common law and under the general provisions of the statutes of this state such an action abates, and unless there can be found some statute altering the rule in this particular case this appeal must be dismissed. It is the claim of appellant that authority to continue the appeal inheres in the power conferred by the constitutional amendment authorizing the enactment of the Workmen's Compensation, Insurance and Safety Act, and if the right to continue the prosecution is not expressly given it is, nevertheless, conferred by the provisions of the act adopted in obedience to the constitutional mandate.

The facts are that the plaintiff and appellant, Albert De La Torre, on the twenty-seventh day of October, 1926, filed a notice of a motion for an order substituting in the place and stead of defendant and respondent W. P. Johnson, who died subsequent to the entry of judgment in the court below, his executor, and allowing the action to be continued against said executor as a codefendant. The executor thereupon filed notice of a motion to dismiss the appeal as to said defendant Johnson upon the ground that the cause of action set forth in the complaint against said defendant abated upon his death. It appears from the affidavits filed by the parties in support of their respective motions that the action is one to recover damages in the sum of seventy-five thousand dollars for personal injuries sustained through the alleged negligent operation of an automobile; and that respondent Johnson was the owner and respondent Smith was March, 1927.] DE LA TORRE v. JOHNSON. 757

his chauffeur and the driver in charge of the automobile at the time said injuries were inflicted upon appellant. The defendants filed separate answers. Defendant Johnson denied that the accident took place while defendant Smith was acting in the course of his employment, and alleged that Smith was engaged on an errand of his own at the time. Defendant Smith denied all allegations of negligence. At the close of the evidence defendant Johnson moved for a directed verdict on the ground that the evidence showed as a matter of law that Smith was not acting within the course of his employment when the accident occurred. The motion was granted. The issues in the case as to the defendant Smith were submitted to the jury, which returned a verdict in his favor. Judgment was accordingly entered on June 10, 1926. Plaintiff's motion for a new trial was denied. On July 19, 1926, he filed a notice of appeal to this court. Defendant Johnson died on August 24, 1926.

[2] Plaintiff recognizes the general rule that a cause of action for personal injuries, in the absence of a statute expressly providing to the contrary, abates upon the death of either the person injured or the tort-feasor (1 Cal. Jur. 71; 1 C. J. 174 and 197; 3 Street's Foundations of Legal Liability, p. 60; Clark v. Goodwin, 170 Cal. 527 [L. R. A. 1916A, 1142, 150 Pac. 357]), and it is not contended that there is any statute of general application in California that keeps alive a cause of action for personal injuries after the death of the tort-feasor except in those certain classes of cases in which the statute creates a sort of privity or quasi-contractual relation. The instant case does not come within any of said classes. [3] It is the contention of appellant, however, that this case is taken out of the general rule by the circumstance that the injury occurred in the course of and arose out of the employment in which appellant was engaged, and that section 26 of the Workmen's Compensation, Insurance and Safety Act (Stats. 1917, p. 831, as amended in 1919, Stats. 1919, p. 920) authorizes the continuance of an action to recover damages for personal injuries which are made compensatable under the provisions of said act after the death of the negligent third party by the substitution of his personal representatives. We cannot accede to this contention.

The opening sentences of section 26 of said act are as follows: "The term 'employee,' as used in this section, shall 758 DE LA TORRE v. JOHNSON. [200 Cal.

include the person injured and any other person in whom a claim may arise by reason of the injury or death of such injured person. The death of the employee, or of any other person, shall not abate any right of action established by this section. The claim of an employee for compensation shall not affect his right of action for damages arising out of injury or death against any person other than the employer; and any employer having paid, or having become obligated to pay compensation, may likewise bring an action against such other person to recover said damages." Subsequent portions of the section provide that if either the employee or employer brings an action for damages against such third person the other must be notified, and may join as a party plaintiff at any time before trial on the facts, and must consolidate his action if brought independently; that if suit be prosecuted by the employer alone evidence of expenditures which he has paid or become obligated to pay by reason of the injury or death is admissible and such expenditures are part of the damages; that the amount of the recovery by the employer over and above what he has paid or become obligated to pay as compensation shall be paid to the employee; that if the employee joins in or prosecutes the suit evidence of the amount of disability indemnity or death benefit paid by the employer shall not be admissible, but proof of all other expenditures on account of the injury shall be admissible and shall be deemed part of the damages; and that the court shall, on application, allow as a first lien against any judgment recovered by the employee the amount of the employer's expenditures for compensation.

[4] The Workmen's Compensation, Insurance and Safety Act does not attempt or purport to grant any right against a tort-feasor to the person who, at the time of the injury, was an employee of a third person that is not accorded to every other member of society similarly situated with respect to casualties which have no relation to the status of employer and employee. In this respect, in the absence of statutory language conferring greater rights upon a class than are conferred upon citizens at large, keeping within constitutional limits, all members of society are placed upon equal terms. The primary purpose of the Workmen's Compensation Act is to afford protection to the employee against the hazards of employment by making the employer responsible. March, 1927.]

DE LA TORRE v. JOHNSON.

[5] Appellant relies strongly upon that portion of section 26 of the act which reads: "The death of the employee, or any other person, shall not abate any right of action established by this section." The section above cited must be construed in connection with and with reference to the subject matter of the act and its manifest object. Its sole and primary object is to fasten a liability on "all employers to compensate their employees for any injury incurred by said employees in the course of their employment, irrespective of the fault of either party." (Art. XX, sec. 21, Const.) [6] The compensation provided for in said act is not damages in the sense that the latter term is used in ordinary tort actions. The right to recover damages for personal injury is not a right of action established by the Workmen's Compensation, Insurance and Safety Act, but a common right established long before the adoption of the Workmen's Compensation Act. The clause providing that the "death of the employee, or of any other person, shall not abate any right of action established by this section," read in the light of the purpose of the act, must be construed to apply to those persons whose right or liability is established by the act. It was the new rights and liabilities created by the Compensation Act which before were nonexistent that were the concern of the lawmakers in framing the act. The rights of the employee, when he steps outside of the Compensation Act and elects to sue a tort-feasor who is not his employer, are not enlarged beyond those given to citizens generally.

[7] The right of the employer to prosecute a suit against the tort-feasor to recover any compensation which he has paid or has become obligated to pay is a new right created by the act. The extent of this right is not a question directly involved in this proceeding. In no way is the common-law rule as to the particular question presented changed or affected by the new right conferred upon the employer by the Workmen's Compensation Act. In addition to the common-law right of action to recover for personal injuries wrongfully inflicted, an employee, as such, is entitled to the protection provided by the act, and, while he has a twofold remedy, his common-law right is not enlarged by the provisions of the Workmen's Compensation Act. Appellant complains that it is illogical to hold that the employer may maintain an action against a tort-feasor's representative to recover compensation 760 COLLEY v. CHOWCHILLA NAT. BANK. [200 Cal.

paid by him on account of the employee's injuries and to deny to the employee the right to maintain an action for damages against said representative. The maintenance of the action by the employer has the support of statutory authority, which does not exist as to the employee. The right of an injured person to maintain an action after the death of the tort-feasor has not the sanction of the common law and stands unsupported by any act or statute of this state. The justification for following appellant in so wide a departure from the long approved rules of law should rest upon express statutory language or upon inferences arising out of the language of the act under construction which are so convincing as to leave no doubt as to legislative intent.

The cause of action against defendant Johnson having abated by reason of his death, the motion to continue the appeal is denied and the motion to dismiss the appeal as to him is granted. It is so ordered.

Curtis, J., Preston, J., Langdon, J., Richards, J., Waste, C. J., and Shenk, J., concurred.

Rehearing denied.

W. C. COLLEY, Respondent, v. THE CHOWCHILLA NATIONAL BANK (a Corporation), Appellant.

THE CHOWCHILLA NATIONAL BANK (a Corporation), Appellant, v. HOPE L. COLLEY et al., Respondents.

[1] CONTRACTS — CONSIDERATION — CHARACTER OF. — Under ordinary circumstances a conveyance of property to a third party by the releasee in consideration of the release of certain obligations by the releasor would be a sufficient consideration, as it implies detriment to the releasee.

[2] ID.—PROMISSORY NOTE — CANCELLATION—NATIONAL BANK—ULTRA VIRES ACT.—Where a national bank took an assignment of a contract to purchase property as security for a promissory note held by it, its agreement thereafter made to cancel the obligation on the note in consideration of the transfer by the maker of the note of the property covered by the contract of purchase March, 1927.] COLLEY v. CHOWCHILLA NAT. BANK. 761

to a party not shown to have any other connection with the transaction is in legal effect the making of a gift of its capital assets by the bank, beneficial only to the third party and without benefit to itself, and the contract is *ultra vires* and void.

[3] Id.—CORPORATIONS—ULTRA VIRES ACT—DEFINITION OF.—The acts of a corporation may be said to be *ultra vires* in different senses: first, when the act is not within the scope of the powers of the corporation to perform under any circumstances, or for any purpose, in which case the act is void *in toto* and the corporation may avail itself of the plea; or in the second case, an act is sometimes *ultra vires* with reference to the rights of certain parties when the corporation is not authorized to perform it without their consent, or with reference to some specific purpose when it is not authorized to perform it for that purpose although fully within the scope of the general powers of the corporation, with the consent of the parties interested, or for some other purpose, and in the latter case the right of the corporation to avail itself of the plea will depend upon the circumstances of the case.

[4] Id.—NOVATION—DEFINITION—PLEADING.—Under section 1530 of the Civil Code, novation is a substitution of a new obligation for an existing one, made as provided by section 1531 of said code, and it must be pleaded either expressly or by unequivocal implication.

[5] Id.—INSUFFICIENT SHOWING OF NOVATION.—Where the only thing shown is that a bank, after accepting a quitclaim deed, asserted in an action brought by it the right to possession of the premises covered by the deed, which was consistent with its rights under the terms of a certain contract of sale, the facts do not show a novation under which said bank agreed to pay the obligation of certain notes held by another bank and secured by a contract of purchase of said property, the obligations of which notes the latter bank agreed with the makers thereof would be canceled in consideration of the execution by the makers of said notes of said deed of the property to the first mentioned bank.

[6] Id.—FINDINGS—INSUFFICIENCY OF EVIDENCE.—In this action it is held that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the findings.

[7] Id.—ASSIGNMENT OF CONTRACT TO PURCHASE LAND—INTERESTS OF ASSIGNEE.—The assignment of a contract to purchase real property gives the assignee an equitable lien or mortgage upon said real property, enforceable against the property in the hands, not only of the original contractor, but also in the hands of his

heirs, administrators, executors, voluntary assignees and purchasers, or encumbrancers with notice, actual or constructive.

[8] Id.—NATIONAL BANKS—TAKING OF SECURITY FOR UNSECURED DEBT—ESTOPPEL.—A national bank would be estopped to deny its power, in getting security for a pre-existing, unsecured debt, to make a valid agreement to release the debtors from personal liability where they had in good faith executed a contract to their detriment by which they transferred property to a third party, as a national bank may lawfully do many things in securing and collecting its loans, in the enforcement of its rights and the conservation of its property previously acquired, which it is not authorized to engage in as a primary business.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Superior Court of Madera County. E. N. Rector, Judge. Reversed.

The facts are stated in the opinion of the court.

W. M. Conley, Matthew Conley, Philip Conley, Lindsay & Conley for Appellant.

Faucett & Ring, in Stead and Place of John W. Maloy, Deceased, and Lee D. Windrem for Respondents.

PRESTON, J.—By a stipulation of the parties the above-entitled causes were heard together in the court below, and while separate judgments were entered in each case and separate notices of appeal filed, still a consolidated record on appeal was prepared and the causes have been carried on our calendar under one number. They will, therefore, be considered and disposed of as one case.

This is appropriate, for the same basic questions underlie them and a determination thereof will guide our action in both causes. They will be known herein as cause one and cause two, respectively, following the order appearing in the caption. From the record it appears that the Los March, 1927.] COLLEY v. CHOWCHILLA NAT. BANK. 763

Angeles Trust & Savings Bank was succeeded by the Pacific Southwest Trust & Savings Bank and they are in reality one; hence reference herein will be made to them as the "Los Angeles bank."

The amended complaint in cause one was by stipulation of the parties made the answer to the complaint in cause two and the court in its findings of fact and conclusions of law adopted said amended complaint as its findings of fact without any other material findings whatsoever. It is, therefore, necessary to briefly set forth the allegations of said amended complaint as follows:

That on the twenty-first day of September, 1921, plaintiff, W. C. Colley, was indebted to the Chowchilla National Bank in the sum of $5,300, evidenced by his promissory note, which, with accrued interest thereon, amounted on the fifteenth day of April, 1922, to the sum of $5,441.45; that at the same time he was also indebted to said bank as indorser upon a promissory note in the principal sum of $2,728, with interest, which said latter indebtedness, after deducting partial payments, amounted on the fifteenth day of April, 1922, to the sum of $1,615.37, said indebtedness totaling on that date the sum of $7,056.82.

That on the first day of May, 1920, Hope L. Colley, on behalf of herself and husband, entered into a written contract of sale and purchase with the Los Angeles Trust & Savings Bank, a corporation, touching eighty acres of real property situate in the county of Madera, state of California, whereby the agreed purchase price of $18,000 was payable in installments covering a period of years and containing the usual covenants.

That on said fifteenth day of April, 1922, a refunding arrangement was entered into between said W. C. Colley and Hope L. Colley, his wife, and the said bank, whereby said indebtedness of W. C. Colley to appellant was subdivided by the execution of five promissory notes, as follows: One for the principal sum of $500, payable November 1, 1923; another for the principal sum of $1,500, payable November 1, 1924; another for the principal sum of $1,500, payable November 1, 1925, said three above-mentioned notes being signed by Hope L. Colley and indorsed by W. C. Colley; a fourth note in the sum of $1,500, due November 1, 1926, and a fifth in the principal sum of $2,059.75, payable 764 COLLEY v. CHOWCHILLA NAT. BANK. [200 Cal.

November 1, 1927, said two last-mentioned notes being executed by W. C. Colley and indorsed by Hope L. Colley; that interest provided for in said notes was eight per cent; that to secure the payment of said notes and each of them said Hope L. Colley made, executed and delivered to said bank an assignment of said contract of sale and purchase above referred to, said assignment being subordinate to a previous assignment which had been made by her to one A. F. Witesman.

Said amended complaint then further provides:

"That after said delivery of said second assignment of contract (meaning the assignment to defendant bank above described) to said defendant and on or about the 22nd day of April, 1922, the said defendant notified said plaintiff that if, at any time before payment of said five new promissory notes, said plaintiff and said Hope L. Colley, his wife, would execute a quitclaim deed of the said real property to Pacific Southwest Trust & Savings Bank, a corporation (formerly the said Los Angeles Trust & Savings Bank, a corporation), the same would operate in full payment of all of the aforesaid indebtedness of said plaintiff to said defendant and that concurrently with the execution of such quitclaim deed by said plaintiff and said Hope L. Colley, the said defendant would thereupon deliver up and surrender to said plaintiff all of the said promissory notes by the terms thereof payable to said defendant as aforesaid; that thereafter and on February 24th, 1923, said plaintiff and said Hope L. Colley executed to said Pacific Southwest Trust & Savings Bank, a corporation, their quitclaim deed of all of said real property, and same was on last said date acknowledged and certified so as to entitle same to be recorded, and the same was on February 27, 1923, recorded in the Office of the County Recorder of the county of Madera, State of California, in Vol. 3 of 'Official Records,' at page 16."

The amended complaint further alleges that at the time said quitclaim deed was made the property covered by said contract was of the reasonable value of $64,000, and the amount due on account of the purchase price thereof, including interest, was not to exceed the sum of $30,000; and that said respondent, Hope L. Colley, owned an equity in said real property which was far in excess of the claims March, 1927.] COLLEY v. CHOWCHILLA NAT. BANK. 765

of said bank; that after the execution of said quitclaim deed the Colleys made demand upon defendant bank to surrender and deliver up to them the two notes first described in said amended complaint, and also the five notes executed later in lieu of said two first-mentioned notes; but that said bank refused to surrender or deliver up any of said notes or to acknowledge payment of all or any or either of them; that, however, no payment had been made on account of said indebtedness except by the execution of said quitclaim deed; that the respondents were not informed as to whether any of said notes had been negotiated; that defendant claimed none of said notes had been paid or in any manner discharged; that great and irreparable damage would be suffered should said notes remain outstanding.

The prayer of said amended complaint was that defendant bank be ordered to deliver up said notes and each of them; that in case it failed to deliver them up, plaintiff have judgment for the principal sum mentioned therein, with interest thereon from and after the fifteenth day of April, 1922, and for general relief.

As above stated this amended complaint was by stipulation of the parties made the answer to the complaint in cause two, which said cause is an action to recover from the Colleys the principal and interest of one of the five promissory notes involved in cause one and interest on two other of said notes.

The court found that all of the allegations of said amended complaint were true and that all of the allegations of the answer of defendant bank were untrue except that defendant bank was a national institution organized under and by virtue of the laws of the United States of America, with its principal place of business at Chowchilla, in the county of Madera, state of California.

Accordingly, in cause one, pursuant to said findings, the court gave judgment in favor of the plaintiff, W. C. Colley, to the effect that said note for $5,300, dated September 21, 1921, be adjudged and declared canceled and no longer an obligation of said plaintiff; that the note in the principal sum of $2,728, bearing the same date, be likewise adjudged and declared canceled and no longer an obligation of said plaintiff, either in whole or in part; and as to the later notes it was adjudged that said defendant bank be ordered and 766 COLLEY v. CHOWCHILLA NAT. BANK. [200 Cal.

required to deliver up each of said five promissory notes set forth in said amended complaint, or in case delivery of any of said promissory notes could not he had, that plaintiff recover from said defendant the principal sum named therein, together with interest on said sum from April 15, 1922, to date of judgment.

In cause two the court likewise adopted the allegations of said amended complaint as its findings and adjudged each of said notes sued upon in said cause two to have been paid and discharged in full and gave judgment for the defendants accordingly. The appeal in cause one is by defendant bank from the judgment in favor of plaintiff and in cause two by plaintiff bank from the judgment in favor of defendants therein.

[1] It is clear from the foregoing that the legal effect of these findings is that the indebtedness to the appellant has been satisfied by the execution of the quitclaim deed to the Los Angeles bank, and that respondents should have a release therefrom in the form of surrender of both said series of notes (Epstein v. Gradowitz, 76 Cal. App. 29 [243 Pac. 877]). Indeed, the findings declare the obligation released upon a new consideration which complies with the provisions of section 1541 of the Civil Code. It is also to be noted that the consideration set forth is not one of specific benefit to appellant, but is one implying only detriment to the respondents. Undoubtedly, under ordinary circumstances, a consideration of this type is sufficient (Civ. Code, sec. 1605).

In 34 Cyc. 1050, the rule is stated as follows: "A consideration for a release moving from a third person on behalf of the releasee, to the releasor or from the releasee to a third person at the request or by the acquiescence of the releasor is as adequate as a consideration moving directly from the releasee to the releasor." (To the same effect see Midland Trust & Sav. Bank v. Nagle, 150 Minn. 279 [184 N. W. 1028], and Gates v. Fauvre, 74 Ind. App. 382 [119 N. E. 155].)

In Rucker v. Bolles, 80 Fed. 504, 513 [25 C. C. A. 600], it is said: "If one party to a contract agrees to release the opposite party therefrom in consideration of his doing some act which he is under no obligation to do, the doing March, 1927.] COLLEY v. CHOWCHILLA NAT. BANK. 767

of that act is a sufficient consideration for the release, altho it was not beneficial to the first party."

[2] But notwithstanding the above set forth principle, we must here deal with a corporation whose powers are circumscribed by the statutes of the United States. In short, we have as the alleged releasor a national banking association which has in practical effect agreed to give a satisfaction of the debt without special benefit of any kind to itself. The legal consequence of the promise as found by the court is that the corporation has covenanted to make a gift of its capital assets for the doing of an act, detrimental to the doer, it is true, but without benefit to itself, and beneficial only to a third party, whose connection, if any, with appellant does not appear from the record. In other words, may a national bank under its powers as defined by the law be held to such a covenant? Appellant insists that such a contract, if proved, would be *ultra vires* the power of the corporation, and we think this contention must be sustained. We must look to the statutes of the United States as construed by the supreme court of the United States for a determination of this question. (*Chemical National Bank v. Havermale*, 120 Cal. 601, 603 [65 Am. St. Rep. 206, 52 Pac. 1071].)

[3] In the early California case of *Miners' Ditch Co. v. Zellerbach*, 37 Cal. 543, 578, 579 [99 Am. Dec. 300], our court, speaking of the doctrine of *ultra vires* as applied to corporations, held: "The term *ultra vires*, whether with strict propriety or not, is also used in different senses. An act is said to be *ultra vires* when it is not within the scope of the powers of the corporation to perform it under any circumstances, or for any purpose. An act is also, sometimes, said to be *ultra vires* with reference to the rights of certain parties when the corporation is not authorized to perform it without their consent; or with reference to some specific purpose when it is not authorized to perform it for that purpose although fully within the scope of the general powers of the corporation, with the consent of the parties interested, or for some other purpose. And the rights of strangers dealing with corporations may vary, according as the act is *ultra vires* in one, or the other, of these senses. All these distinctions must be constantly borne in mind in considering a question arising out of dealings with a corporation. When an act is *ultra vires* in the first sense 768 COLLEY v. CHOWCHILLA NAT. BANK. [200 Cal.

mentioned, it is generally, if not always, void *in toto*, and the corporation may avail itself of the plea. But when it is *ultra vires* in the second sense, the right of the corporation to avail itself of the plea will depend upon the circumstances of the case."

This definition of *ultra vires* and this classification of the types thereof was adopted by the supreme court of the United States in the case of *National Bank & Loan Co. v. Petrie*, 189 U. S. 423 [47 L. Ed. 879, 23 Sup. Ct. Rep. 512, see, also, Rose's U. S. Notes].

We think that the agreement here involved comes clearly under the first subdivision of the subject and is *ultra vires* in the first or proper sense. In *Central Transp. Co. v. Pullman Car Co.*, 139 U. S. 24, 59 [35 L. Ed. 55, 11 Sup. Ct. Rep. 478, see, also, Rose's U. S. Notes], the supreme court of the United States said: "A contract of a corporation, which is *ultra vires*, in the proper sense, that is to say, outside the object of its creation as defined in the law of its organization and therefore beyond the powers conferred upon it by the legislature, is not voidable only, but wholly void, and of no legal effect. The objection of the contract is, not merely that the corporation ought not to have made it, but that it could not make it." See, also, to the same effect: *Union Pacific Ry. v. Chicago etc. Ry.*, 163 U. S. 564 [41 L. Ed. 265, 16 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1173], and *California National Bank v. Kennedy*, 167 U. S. 367 [42 L. Ed. 198, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 831].

The power of a national bank to deal in shares of stock or shares in a partnership was before the supreme court of the United States in the following cases: *National Bank of Ottawa v. Converse*, 200 U. S. 425 [50 L. Ed. 537, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 306], and *Merchants National Bank v. Wehrmann*, 202 U. S. 295 [50 L. Ed. 1036, 26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 613]. In the latter case the court said: "It is not necessary in this case to say that shares like the present could not be accepted as security in any form by a national bank. But such a bank cannot accept an absolute transfer of them to itself. It recently has been decided that a national bank cannot take stock in a new speculative corporation, with the common double liability, in satisfaction of a debt. (First National Bank of Ottawa v. Converse, 200 U. S. 425 [50 L. Ed. 537, March, 1927.] COLLEY v. CHOWCHILLA NAT. BANK. 769

26 Sup. Ct. Rep. 306].) *A fortiori*, it cannot take shares in a partnership to the same end."

The rule as laid down in 7 Corpus Juris, page 784, is as follows: "The officers of a national bank cannot bind it by contracts or acts which are not within the scope of the business which the bank is authorized to transact, such as . . . agreeing to receive anything but money in payment of a non-negotiable note endorsed to the bank, or making donations to a charity or to public or private enterprises."

The reason for the rule is found in *McCormick v. Market National Bank*, 165 U. S. 550 [41 L. Ed. 817, 17 Sup. Ct. Rep. 433], as follows: "The doctrine of *ultra vires* by which a contract made by a corporation beyond the scope of its corporate powers is unlawful and void and will not support an action, rests, as this court has often recognized and affirmed, upon three distinct grounds: the obligation of anyone contracting with a corporation, to take notice of the legal limits of its powers; the interest of the stockholders, not to be subject to risks which they have never undertaken; and above all, the interest of the public, that the corporation shall not transcend the powers conferred upon it by law."

[4] Respondents, however, practically conceding the force of the above authorities, vigorously contend that the pleadings, proof, and findings warrant the conclusion that respondents are entitled to the relief given them by the court because of a novation of the contract wherein and whereby respondents were released from their obligation to appellant and a new contract was made between appellant and the Los Angeles bank, whereby said latter bank assumed and agreed to pay the indebtedness of respondents to appellant.

We have been cited to no evidence nor can any be found to sustain this contention of respondents. The legal principles comprising the doctrine of novation as far as the same are here involved may be stated as follows:

Civil Code, section 1530: "Novation is the substitution of a new obligation for an existing one."

Civil Code, section 1531: "Modes of novation: Novation is made: 1. By the substitution of a new obligation between the same parties, with intent to extinguish the old obligation; 2. By the substitution of a new debtor in place of the old one, with intent to release the latter; or, 3. By the substitution of a new creditor in place of the old one, with

200 Cal.—49 770 COLLEY v. CHOWCHILLA NAT. BANK. [200 Cal.

intent to transfer the rights of the latter to the former."

In 20 Cal. Jur., page 250, it is said: "But when it is clear that a new contract has been entered into without fraud and upon the understanding and with the intent that it shall be substituted for a former one, a novation is affected and the former agreement is extinguished. For example, it is said that where a bank to which checks on another bank are sent for collection, accepts credit from the drawee bank instead of requiring payment, such acceptance of the obligation of the drawee bank in discharge of the check amounts to novation between the two banks."

Novation must be pleaded either expressly or by unequivocal implication (Trabucco v. Collins, 39 Cal. App. 412 [179 Pac. 221]; McGinn v. Willey, 24 Cal. App. 303 [141 Pac. 49]; 20 Cal. Jur. 258; People's State Bank v. Penello, 67 Cal. App. 103 [227 Pac. 190]; Anglo-California Trust Co. v. Wallace, 58 Cal. App. 625 [209 Pac. 78]). The amended complaint is wholly deficient in this regard. The burden of establishing a novation is upon the party asserting its existence (Anglo-California Trust Co. v. Wallace, supra, Robinson v. Rispin, 33 Cal. App. 536 [165 Pac. 979], Brown v. Coffee, 17 Cal. App. 381 [121 Pac. 309], and Linder Hardware Co. v. Pacific Sugar Corp., 17 Cal. App. 81 [118 Pac. 785]).

In 20 Ruling Case Law, at page 367, we find the following rule announced: "An essential element of every novation is a new contract to which all the parties concerned agree . . . It is essential then, in order to constitute a novation, by which the original debtor is released, the creditor being bound thereby to discharge the debt as to him and look to another for the payment of his demand, that a contract be made between the new debtor and the creditor by which the claim can be enforced against such new debtor, and if the new debtor enters into no contract with the creditor by which he becomes the debtor of the creditor, so that the creditor may maintain an action against him, there is not a novation."

In 29 Cyc., at page 1136 and page 1139, the rule is again stated: "The most frequent novation is the substitution of a new debtor. To constitute this kind of a novation, there must be a mutual agreement among three parties, the creditor, his immediate debtor and the intended new debtor, March, 1927.] COLLEY v. CHOWCHILLA NAT. BANK. 771

by which the liability of the last named is accepted in the place of the original debtor in discharge of the original debt. . . . The burden of proof rests upon him who asserts that there has been a novation to establish it."

While it is true that a novation may be established by implication, nevertheless "such implication cannot arise until there is evidence showing facts and circumstances from which it may reasonably be inferred that such was the intention." (20 Cal. Jur. 258, *People's State Bank v. Penello, supra*, and *Anglo-California Trust Co. v. Wallace, supra*.)

[5] A discussion to be made later herein of the evidence will disclose that the record contains no facts whatsoever from which it can be said that a new contract was made between the Los Angeles bank and appellant for payment of said indebtedness, with the intention of releasing and discharging the old obligation existing on the part of respondents or any agreement whatsoever to assume or pay the same.

Respondents also insist that under the principle announced in section 1589 of the Civil Code, the Los Angeles bank, having accepted the quitclaim deed, must be held to have assumed and agreed to pay and satisfy the indebtedness to appellant. The only thing shown by the record is that said bank, after accepting said quitclaim deed, asserted in an action brought by it the right to possession of said premises, but this is consistent with its rights under the terms of the contract of sale. It might have otherwise caused to be forfeited the rights of the respondents by declaring them in default and taking proceedings under the terms of the contract for that purpose and thus get possession of the land. There was nothing done by it that was not in strict accord with the enforcement of the contract, and this without reference of any kind to the claim of appellant bank for the indebtedness of respondents to it. The evidence shows nothing compelling the conclusion that the said bank assumed or agreed to pay any portion of this indebtedness of the respondents to appellant. The respondents were on the verge of insolvency, having made at least three assignments of said contract of sale and purchase as security for large amounts of indebtedness, and they were, as above noted, in default upon their payments under the contract itself. No reason whatsoever is shown by the record for an 772 COLLEY v. CHOWCHILLA NAT. BANK. [200 Cal.

independent promise of payment of their indebtedness to appellant by the Los Angeles bank.

In the foregoing and subsequent discussions we have assumed that action by the several presidents of the appellant bank was in each case action by the bank itself, for we conclude that the president and such officers who acted herein had actual or ostensible authority to bind the bank in every way that it could be bound under the law. (4 Cal. Jur. 158; *Jennings v. Bank of California*, 79 Cal. 323 [12 Am. St. Rep. 145, 5 L. R. A. 233, 21 Pac. 852]; *Burnell v. San Francisco Savings Union*, 136 Cal. 499 [69 Pac. 144]; *Carpy v. Dowdell*, 115 Cal. 677 [47 Pac. 695]; *Newton v. Johnston Organ etc. Mfg. Co.*, 180 Cal. 185 [180 Pac. 7], and *Bartlett Est. Co. v. Fraser*, 11 Cal. App. 373 [105 Pac. 130].)

[6] Appellant further insists that the findings hereinabove discussed are without support in the evidence, and we agree also with that contention. The most that can be claimed under the evidence is that the appellant bank, in order to get security for the pre-existing loan made to respondent W. C. Colley, promised the respondents that if the new notes were executed by them and the contract of sale and purchase assigned as security therefor, that if and when the land covered by said contract was sold, the bank would look to the purchase price received for payment of the loan, and if it became necessary on account of untoward circumstances for respondents without a sale to quitclaim or release their equity back to the legal owner, that appellant should and would release respondents from personal liability on said notes. And that after said new notes were executed and the security given this promise was renewed and was relied upon when the quitclaim deed was executed and delivered.

There is no evidence that the bank agreed to cancel the indebtedness outright, nor is there any evidence that it promised to release or forego the security afforded by the assignment of the contract. [7] The assignment of this contract gave the appellant an equitable lien or mortgage upon said real property, enforceable against the property in the hands not only of the original contractor, but also in the hands of his heirs, administrators, executors, voluntary assignees, and purchasers or encumbrancers with notice, actual or constructive (17 Cal. Jur. 734, secs. 38-40; *Title Ins. & Trust* March, 1927.] COLLEY v. CHOWCHILLA NAT. BANK. 773

*Co. v. California Dev. Co., 171 Cal. 173 [152 Pac. 542]*). And no excuse can be found in the evidence for making the improvident promise to forego this security. Neither does the evidence fix any date or other time for the surrender to respondents of said notes, and the most favorable deduction that could be made from it in behalf of respondents is that said notes would be returned to them when and not until the security given for them had been realized upon. In short, giving the evidence the fullest weight, it amounts to no more in legal effect than a waiver by appellant bank of its claim for a deficiency judgment after a foreclosure or satisfaction of the equitable lien or mortgage given it by the assignment of the real estate contract.

Neither is there any evidence whatsoever that the Los Angeles bank assumed or agreed to pay or to become personally liable or liable in any other way for said indebtedness. There is likewise no evidence whatsoever of a substitution of the said bank in the place and stead of the respondents with intent to release them from the obligation of their notes.

The evidence further shows that the respondents were in default both to the Los Angeles bank and upon their other obligations; that they were threatened with and were themselves threatening bankruptcy at the time said quitclaim deed was executed. It is true that at the time said deed was made it was done on the advice and at the instigation of Mr. Witesman, the then president of appellant bank, but, as above pointed out, nothing was said or done by any representative of appellant which indicated an intention to release and satisfy said indebtedness. On the contrary, the clear inference is that appellant bank in so advising said quitclaim deed did not intend to satisfy said indebtedness, but doubtless thought that its rights would remain *in statu quo* or probably be benefited by execution thereof. There is, not one word of evidence that at the time of making the deed, or any other time, appellant promised to forego and surrender the security given it by the execution of said assignment.

Summing up the whole situation, the inference is clear that at most the bank was moving in its own interests in trying to get security for its obligation and later to realize upon it, and was not in any sense intending to satisfy said indebtedness altogether, but was willing to release respondents from 774 COLLEY v. CHOWCHILLA NAT. BANK. [200 Cal.

personal liability only upon said notes and surrender them only when said security had been exhausted. Had the court made findings and given judgment in accord with this construction of the effect of the evidence, we would have been constrained to hold that such an agreement would have been within the power of the appellant to make, for in our opinion such an act on the part of appellant would have been at most *ultra vires* under the second subdivision of the doctrine announced in *Miners' Ditch Co. v. Zellerbach, supra*, and the appellant in such event would have been estopped from setting up this defense. This observation is also pertinent in the consideration of the appeal in cause two, for, as we have observed, the court found said notes sued upon had been paid and gave judgment accordingly for respondents, who were defendants in the court below in cause two. The defense that the bank had waived personal liability of defendants on the notes was not made. Neither was the defense that an independent action would not lie under section 726 of the Code of Civil Procedure made. On the contrary, the court took the broad ground that said notes, by the execution of said quitclaim deed to a third party, had been thereby paid.

[8] As the cause may be retried, we feel called upon to say that under the general powers of the appellant as a national banking corporation, and under Revised Statutes of the United States, section 5136, which grants "all such incidental powers as shall be necessary to carry on the business of banking," and section 5137, which confers the power to take, hold and convey real property mortgaged to secure a pre-existing indebtedness, together with the right to convey or expose same to sale and purchase it thereat, appellant would be estopped to deny its power, in getting security for a pre-existing, unsecured debt, to make a valid agreement to release the respondents from personal liability on same where they had in good faith executed to their detriment their covenants under such a contract. (See *Ohio & Mississippi Ry. Co. v. McCarthy*, 96 U. S. 258 [24 L. Ed. 693].) In *Morris v. Third Nat. Bank of Springfield, Mass.*, 142 Fed. 25 [73 C. C. A. 211], the court said: "A national bank may lawfully do many things in securing and collecting its loans, in the enforcement of its rights and the conservation of its property previously ac- March, 1927.] COLLEY v. CHOWCHILLA NAT. BANK. 775

quired, which it is not authorized to engage in as a primary business."

In *First Nat. Bank v. National Exch. Bank*, 92 U. S. 122 [123 L. Ed. 679], the court said: " . . . Authority is thus given to transact such a banking business as is specified, and all incidental powers necessary to carry it on are granted. These powers are such as are required to meet all the legitimate demands of the authorized business, and to enable a bank to conduct its affairs, within the general scope of its charter. . . . This necessarily implies the right of a bank to incur liabilities in the . . . course of its business as well as to become a creditor of others. Its own obligations must be met and debts due to it collected or secured. The power to adopt reasonable and appropriate measures for these purposes is an incident to the power to incur the liability or become the creditor. Obligations may be assumed that result unfortunately . . . Compromises to avoid or reduce losses are oftentimes the necessary results. . . . These compromises come within the general scope of the powers committed to the . . . directors and officers, . . . and are submitted to their judgment and discretion, except to the extent that they are restrained by the charter. . . . Banks may do, in this behalf, whatever natural persons could do under like circumstances." (See, also, *Second Nat. Bank v. United States Fidelity & Guar. Co.*, 266 Fed. 489.)

In *Teele v. Rockport Granite Co.*, 224 Mass. 20, 25 [112 N. E. 497], it was said: "Whatever transactions are fairly incidental or auxiliary to the main business of the corporation and necessary or expedient in the protection, care and management of its property, may be undertaken by the corporation and be within the scope of its corporate powers." (See, also, 14a C. J. 252.) It was this principle that the court had in mind in the case of *James Eva Estate v. Oakland B. & M. Co.*, 40 Cal. App. 515 [181 Pac. 415].

We deem it unnecessary to consider the further point raised by appellant that because the covenants claimed were not contained in the contemporaneous written instruments, evidence in respect thereto would be inadmissible, for we have held, treating the evidence as admissible, that it is insufficient to support the findings.

The judgment of the court in cause one in declaring the notes paid and in ordering them to be delivered up for 776 MEYER v. SUPERIOR COURT. [200 Cal.

cancellation is clearly in excess of any relief warranted by the findings or the evidence. This observation is also true of the provisions authorizing, in case of nondelivery, a judgment against appellant bank for the principal sums mentioned in said notes with interest from the fifteenth day of April, 1922.

In cause two the judgment was to the effect that the notes had been satisfied and discharged. The said judgment is likewise, for the reasons hereinabove pointed out, clearly in excess of any relief warranted by the evidence in the case; however, upon the facts as shown by the record here presented the effect of this decision is to hold that respondents are entitled to be released from personal liability upon said obligations sued upon herein.

It therefore becomes necessary to reverse the judgment in both cases, and it is so ordered, with instructions to the court below to take such further proceedings in them as may be deemed advisable, not inconsistent with the views herein expressed.

[1] ESTATES OF DECEASED PERSONS—TESTAMENTARY TRUSTS—CONSTRUCTION—STATUS OF PARTIES.—Where a trust created by will provided that the daughter of the decedent was to receive as beneficiary a certain share of the net income to be derived from the operation of the trust property but that upon her death her allotted share of the principal of the estate "should be transferred and distributed as she may by will direct," the death of the daughter terminated her relationship under the trust and worked an immediate elimination of her allotted share in the principal of the estate from the control of the trust and trans- March, 1927.] MEYER v. SUPERIOR COURT. 777

ferred the same to her devisee; and her devisee became a tenant in common of the property with the trustee.

[2] Id.—DEATH OF TRUSTEE—RIGHTS OF DEVISEE.—In such a case, upon the death of the daughter of the decedent, who was a trustee under his will, all the rights and interests which she had in the trust property by reason of being such trustee came to an end and did not descend to her devisee.

[3] Id.—INTEREST OF WIDOW—SUCCESSION TO DAUGHTER—STATUS OF. Where the decedent in such a case transferred the bulk of his property to trustees for certain purposes, but the widow claimed and received her community interest in the property instead of taking under the trust, the widow thereby become a tenant in common with the trustees of the property, as did the daughter as to the part of the property which she took as an heir of her mother.

[4] Id.—CONSTRUCTION OF WILL—CONTINGENT REMAINDERS.—From a construction of the will in this case it is held that, under the trust therein created, the right and interest of a daughter of the decedent, to which she, as one of the heirs, would succeed in the event of one or more of her coheirs dying without issue or without making such testamentary disposition as they were entitled to make under the will, were contingent remainders existing at the time of said daughter's death and to which her sole devisee would be entitled under her will; and that such contingent remainders would be defeated by the death of certain coheirs leaving issue and by the making of testamentary disposition by others.

[5] Id.—RIPENING OF ESTATE—RELATION OF PARTIES.—In such a case, if the interests of the daughter of the decedent represented by the contingent remainders had ripened, during her lifetime, through the death of any one or more of her coheirs under circumstances which would have called such contingent remainders into being, she would not have, as to these rights, become a cestui que trust under the trust estate, but only a tenant in common as to such remainders with the trust estate, and her sole devisee could not in the nature of things become vested with any greater or different interests.

[6] Id.—TRUST ESTATE—TENANT IN COMMON—VACANCY IN TRUSTEESHIP—RIGHT OF TENANT IN COMMON.—A tenant in common of property, the remaining undivided interest in which is held in a trust estate, the trusteeship of which has become vacant, is not entitled of right to participate in proceedings in the Superior Court having jurisdiction over such trust instituted for the purpose of filling such vacancy, or to receive notice of such proceedings before such court or the judge thereof can acquire jurisdiction to proceed to fill such vacant trusteeship. 778 MEYER v. SUPERIOR COURT. [200 Cal.

[7] Id.—TENANTS IN COMMON—NATURE OF TITLE.—The only unity of tenants in common in the property held by them as such by several and distinct titles is that of possession.

[8] Id.—VACANCY IN TRUSTEESHIP—APPOINTMENT—RIGHT IN TENANT IN COMMON AND REMAINDERMEN.—In such a case, the widower of the daughter of the decedent secondly mentioned in his will, who was her sole devise, occupies no such relation to the trust or to the trust property as would entitle him, either as tenant in common or as successor to his wife in the contingent remainders provided by the trust, to maintain, as a matter of right, an action or proceeding instituted by him as plaintiff against the beneficiaries of the trust for the appointment of a successor to the vacant trusteeship therein; nor is he entitled to receive notice of proceedings instituted by the beneficiaries among themselves for the appointment of a trustee to such vacant trusteeship, such notice to him not being a prerequisite to the jurisdiction of the Superior Court to make such appointment.

[9] Id.—MORTGAGEE—APPOINTMENT OF TRUSTEE.—A corporation holding mortgages on trust property to secure indebtedness created under order of court by the trustee is neither entitled to notice of a proceeding for the appointment of a trustee nor to be consulted in such appointment.

[10] Id.—APPOINTMENT OF RECEIVERS.—There is no provision in the statutes relating to the appointment of receivers which imposes a jurisdictional requirement that other parties than the necessary and proper parties to the action or proceeding in question must be brought in as parties thereto or must receive notice of the application for the appointment of the receiver.

C. F. Hanlon, Louis S. Beedy, J. W. Dorsey and Thomas, Beedy & Presley for Respondents.

RICHARDS, J.—This is an application for a writ of prohibition to be directed against respondents herein, the Superior Court of the State of California in and for the City and County of San Francisco, and the Honorable Thomas F. Graham, one of the Judges of said court, prohibiting said court and the Judge thereof from further proceeding upon a certain judgment made and entered by said court and from taking any further steps for the enforcement thereof, and of an order made by said court appointing one Louis S. Beedy general receiver of the real and personal property belonging to that certain trust estate to which said judgment relates, and further directing that said judgment and all proceedings had or taken thereunder, including said order appointing said receiver, be vacated and annulled and that said Superior Court and the Judge thereof be directed to permit the petitioners herein to file their respective complaints in intervention in said action and to be heard upon the merits thereon.

The action in which the foregoing proceedings were had and taken by said court was one wherein James Clay Dunphy, Mary Dunphy Flood, and Viola C. C. P. Burnett are plaintiffs, and one William Wesley Burnett, Jr., is the sole defendant, and which action was commenced in said court for the purpose of having the said plaintiffs therein appointed trustees of certain real and personal properties lying and being within the states of California and Nevada, and which properties were subject to a certain trust created and existing under the terms of the last will and testament of one William Dunphy, deceased, the trusteeships over said trust having become vacant by the death of those persons who had been originally appointed the trustees thereof under the terms of said will.

The undisputed facts upon which the merits of this proceeding are to be considered and determined may be summarized as follows: On September 17, 1892, William Dunphy died testate in San Francisco, California, being at the time of his death a resident therein, and leaving a large estate, both real and personal, in the states of California and Nevada. A considerable portion of his said holdings consisted of the 780 MEYER v. SUPERIOR COURT. [200 Cal.

so-called Dunphy ranch in the state of Nevada, consisting approximately of 160,000 acres of land, together with a large amount of personal property located thereon, consisting of cattle, horses, farming implements, and utensils of great value. At the time of his death said decedent left surviving him as his sole heirs at law his wife, Carmen U. Dunphy, his three children, James Clay Dunphy, Mary Dunphy Flood, and Jennie C. Dunphy, and also a grandchild, daughter of a deceased daughter, Viola C. C. P. Burnett. By his will the decedent, after making certain specific bequests, devised and bequeathed the entire residue of his estate to his wife, Carmen U. Dunphy, and his daughter, Jennie C. Dunphy, in trust for the following purposes and with the following powers: The said trustees were to take full control and possession of all of the properties, real and personal, of said decedent and were to manage and conduct the same. They were to sell and convert into cash the personal property of said decedent in the county of Monterey, California, and also the real and personal property in the state of Nevada as soon as practicable and for the best price obtainable, and were to invest the proceeds of such sales in real estate in the city and county of San Francisco, California, improved and unimproved; and if unimproved, sufficient money was to be retained to improve such investments so that the property would be made to produce a steady and reasonable income. The net income of the decedent's entire estate, in whatever form the latter was or continued to be or take, was to be divided into five equal shares. One-fifth of said income was to be paid quarterly to the decedent's said widow during her life, and upon her death one-fifth of the said principal of his estate was to be transferred and distributed as his said widow should by will direct, or in case she should make no such direction said one-fifth thereof was to go to the decedent's heirs at law. One-fifth of said income was to be paid quarterly to his daughter Mary Dunphy Flood during her life. Upon her death one-fifth of the said principal of his estate was to go to her children, or if she should leave no child said one-fifth was to go to the decedent's heirs at law. One-fifth of said income was to be paid quarterly to his son James C. Dunphy during his life and at his death one-fifth of the said principal of his estate was to be paid as his said son might by will direct, and if he should make no March, 1927.] MEYER v. SUPERIOR COURT. 781

such direction the same was to go to his children, and if he should leave no child, said one-fifth was to go to the decedent's heirs at law. One-fifth of said income was to be paid quarterly during her life to his daughter Jennie C. Dunphy and at her death one-fifth of said principal of his said estate was to be transferred and distributed as she might by will direct, and if she should make no such direction it was to go to her children, or if she should leave no children then to the decedent's heirs at law. The remaining fifth of said income was to be paid to his said daughter Jennie C. Dunphy, to be by her applied to the support and maintenance of his said granddaughter Viola while she should remain in the custody of the Dunphy family during her minority, and thereafter one-fifth of said income, less certain deductions, were to be paid to her quarterly during her life, and upon her death one-fifth of the principal of decedent's estate was to go to her children, or, if she should leave no children, then to the decedent's heirs at law. The will further provided that in case the widow of said decedent should elect not to take under said will, but to claim her share of the community property of said estate, then and in that event the balance of the decedent's said estate should go to the trustees and be divided into four equal parts among his said children and grandchild upon the same terms, conditions, provisions, and limitations as are above set forth. By the terms of said will his trustees were given full power and authority to make any and all sales, investments, and outlays in respect to said trust property without applying to any court or judge for leave so to do, and without being required to offer or produce in any court vouchers for said outlays or for any acts and deeds performed or expenditures made by them, and that such outlays, acts, deeds, and expenditures were to be deemed proper and necessary, and the propriety and necessity thereof were never to be questioned. In the event of the death, absence, or inability of either of said trustees to act, the other of them was to act and serve alone with all the powers given to both. The trustees were also by the terms of said will made the executrices thereof without bonds. Said will was admitted to probate, shortly after decedent's death, in the Superior Court of the City and County of San Francisco. The widow elected not to take under the will, but to take one- 782 MEYER v. SUPERIOR COURT. [200 Cal.

half of the residue of said estate, all of which was community property. The principal administration of said estate was conducted in the state of California, but ancillary administration thereon was also had in the state of Nevada, covering the property, both real and personal, situate therein. At the conclusion of the administration in Nevada a final distribution was therein made and entered distributing one-half of the residue of the decedent's estate therein located to Carmen U. Dunphy, surviving widow of said deceased, and the remaining one-half to Carmen U. Dunphy and Jennie C. Dunphy as trustees, in accordance with the trust provisions contained in said will. Thereafter Carmen U. Dunphy died, leaving her property to be succeeded to by her said three children and grandchild in equal shares. An administration of her estate was had in the state of California and an ancillary administration thereon in the state of Nevada, as a result of which the distribution of her estate was made to her surviving children and grandchild as above stated. Final distribution in the estate of William Dunphy, deceased, in California was not decreed until after the death of Carmen U. Dunphy, and in consequence thereof the decree of distribution therein made distributed the remaining undivided one-half of the estate to Jennie C. Dunphy as surviving trustee thereof in accordance with the terms of the trust created by the will of William Dunphy, deceased. After the death of Carmen U. Dunphy partition proceedings were instituted in the state of Nevada affecting the aforesaid properties located in said state, and these resulted in the partition of said properties, by the terms of the decree in which proceedings one-half of the said Dunphy ranch, consisting approximately of 80,000 acres, was set apart in severalty to said Jennie C. Dunphy as the surviving trustee of said trust, and the remaining one-half of said ranch property was divided into four parcels, each containing 20,000 acres, each of said children and grandchild receiving one of said parcels. The personal property upon said real estate was also partitioned, as a result of which Mary Dunphy Flood and Viola C. C. Piercy, who had by marriage become Viola C. C. P. Burnett, each received their proportionate share of said personal property. As to James Clay Dunphy, his interest in said personal property had theretofore been acquired by the trustees, and in consequence March, 1927.] MEYER v. SUPERIOR COURT. 783

thereof the trust estate was awarded an undivided five-sixth interest in said personal property. The individual interest of Jennie C. Dunphy therein was not partitioned, although she was declared entitled to an undivided one-sixth interest therein. In the meantime Jennie C. Dunphy had married X. Rodwell Meyer, who is one of the petitioners herein, and under said name continued to conduct the operations of said trust, in the course of which, through leases of the portions of the said ranch which had been set off in severalty as above set forth, she succeeded in keeping intact the said ranch properties in the state of Nevada, and in operating and conducting the same, involving the employment of many persons and the expenditure of large sums of money, to the extent that during the administration of her said trust it became necessary to borrow the sum of $200,000. Accordingly, in proceedings instituted in the courts of Nevada by her acting as such trustee, she was given permission as such to make said loans and to execute a mortgage or mortgages upon the Dunphy ranch properties belonging to said trust; whereupon the said sum of $200,000 was borrowed from the Hibernia Savings and Loan Society of San Francisco in two loans of $100,000 each, and mortgages upon said properties as security therefor were duly executed and delivered to said mortgagee by said surviving trustee. Jennie C. Dunphy Meyer died on January 25, 1926, having up to the time of her death continued to act and serve as the surviving trustee of said trust. She left a last will and testament, by the terms of which, having left no issue, she devised and bequeathed the entire residue of her estate, after making certain specific bequests, both real and personal, to her surviving husband, X. Rodwell Meyer, who was also made the sole executor of her said will, and who, after due proceedings had in the matter of the probate thereof, was by the Superior Court of California in and for the City and County of San Francisco duly appointed such executor and duly qualified and continued thereafter to act as such. After the death of Jennie C. D. Meyer and the creation thereby of a vacancy in the trusteeship created by the will of William Dunphy, deceased, and after the appointment and qualification of X. Rodwell Meyer as executor of the will of Jennie C. D. Meyer, deceased, X. Rodwell Meyer commenced an action in the Superior Court of the State of 784 MEYER v. SUPERIOR COURT. [200 Cal.

California in and for the City and County of San Francisco, on March 12, 1926, wherein he named himself as the plaintiff, both individually and as executor of the last will of his wife, and wherein he named as the defendants James Clay Dunphy, Mary Dunphy Flood, Viola C. C. Piercy Burnett, William Wesley Burnett, Jr., and the Hibernia Savings and Loan Society, for the purpose of procuring a judgment of said court appointing a trustee of said trust to fill the vacancy therein caused by the death of Jennie C. D. Meyer. The defendants in said action, after due service of process therein, with the exception of the defendant corporation, appeared in said action and filed their demurrer to said complaint. The complaint was thereupon amended, and it was thereupon agreed and stipulated by the aforesaid parties to said action, other than said defendant corporation, that the demurrer of said defendants presented to the original complaint should stand as their demurrer to the amended complaint. In the meantime and on April 15, 1926, James Clay Dunphy, Mary Dunphy Flood, and Viola C. C. P. Burnett, as plaintiffs, commenced an action in the same Superior Court, naming as the sole defendant therein William Wesley Burnett, Jr., in which action said plaintiffs also sought to have entered a judgment of said court appointing a trustee or trustees of said trust estate in the place and stead of Jennie C. D. Meyer, deceased, each of said plaintiffs nominating and appointing each of their said coplaintiffs to be and act as such trustee or trustees. Neither the said X. Rodwell Meyer nor the said Hibernia Savings and Loan Society was made a party to said action or was served with any process therein. Thereafter and on or about May 6, 1926, X. Rodwell Meyer, individually and as executor of the will of Jennie C. Meyer, deceased, gave notice to the plaintiffs in said action, both as plaintiffs therein and as defendants in the action theretofore instituted by him, of a motion for an order to be made therein consolidating said last-named action with that theretofore commenced by him, which said motion came on regularly for hearing before said Superior Court in Department No. 10 thereof, Honorable Thomas F. Graham, Judge therein, presiding, which said motion was argued and submitted for decision, and on September 1, 1926, denied. On said sixth day of May, 1926, the Hibernia Savings and Loan Society, also served upon the attorneys for the plaintiffs in March, 1927.] MEYER v. SUPERIOR COURT. 785

said last-named action a notice of motion for leave to become and be made a party to said action, to wit, a defendant therein and to be permitted to appear in whatever proceedings were thereafter to be taken therein for the appointment of a trustee or trustees and for such other purposes as were embraced in said action, said motion being made upon the ground that said corporation was the owner and holder of the aforesaid promissory notes and mortgages upon said trust estate and was for that reason interested in the matter of the appointment of a trustee or trustees therein. Said motion came on for hearing in due course in said court before Honorable Thomas F. Graham, Judge thereof, and having been argued and submitted was on the first day of September, 1926, denied by said court. On May 17, 1926, X. Rodwell Meyer, individually and as executor of the last will of Jennie C. D. Meyer, deceased, served upon the plaintiffs in said last-named action a notice of motion for leave to intervene in said action, and filed therein a complaint in intervention, a copy of which accompanied said notice of motion. A hearing thereon was regularly had before said court upon said motion, which was on September 1, 1926, denied. On August 27, 1926, the said Superior Court in the first above-named action instituted by the petitioner herein X. Rodwell Meyer, individually and as executor of the will of Jennie C. D. Meyer, deceased, entered its order sustaining the demurrer interposed by the defendants therein to the amended complaint, with leave to the plaintiff within ten days thereafter to further amend the complaint. The plaintiff, however, neglected and declined to further amend the complaint. On September 1, 1926, by consent of the plaintiffs and defendant in the action of James C. Dunphy et al. v. William Wesley Burnett, Jr., the trial of said action was brought on for hearing before said court over the protest of X. Rodwell Meyer and of the Hibernia Savings and Loan Society, each of which parties had theretofore vainly sought to become parties to said action, and who attempted to appear therein for the purpose of objecting to the jurisdiction of said court to further proceed therein or to appoint a trustee or trustees therein until the said protesting parties should be permitted to appear therein and afforded the opportunity to examine the applicants for appointment as such trustees. The trial court overruled their objections and pro-

200 Cal.—50 786 MEYER v. SUPERIOR COURT. [200 Cal.

tests upon the ground that they were not interested parties in said action, and, having done so, proceeded with the trial thereof, as a result of which a judgment was made and entered therein appointing James C. Dunphy, Mary Dunphy Flood, and Viola C. C. P. Burnett trustees of said trust, and conferring upon them, and each of them, full authority and power to manage and control said trust properties in conformity with the terms and provisions of said will of William C. Dunphy, deceased, creating said trust. The trial court also in said action and upon the application and consent of the plaintiffs and defendants therein, and over the protest of the petitioners herein, proceeded to appoint one Louis S. Beedy as a receiver of the trust properties involved in said action. Said Louis S. Beedy having qualified as such receiver under said appointment is proceeding to exercise the powers and functions of said receiver over the properties of said trust in the state of California and in the state of Nevada. In the meantime and on September 2, 1926, X. Rodwell Meyer, individually and as executor of the will of his deceased wife, commenced an action in the district court of the fourth judicial district of the state of Nevada, having jurisdiction over the properties involved in said trust, in which action Mary Dunphy Flood, James Clay Dunphy, Viola C. C. P. Burnett, William Wesley Burnett, Jr., and the Hibernia Savings and Loan Society are named as defendants, which action has for its purpose the appointment of a trustee of said trust and of the trust property thereof located in the state of Nevada, and has procured an order of said court appointing one George Russell, Jr., temporary trustee of said trust, with power to take possession and administer said trust property in said state, and who has qualified as such trustee and is undertaking to exercise said trust. Proceedings have been commenced by the trustees appointed by the respondent court herein in the supreme court of the state of Nevada, whereby they are seeking to avoid, vacate, and have set aside the appointment of said Russell as such temporary trustee, and they have secured in such proceeding a temporary restraining order preventing said Russell from further exercising the powers and functions of a trustee with respect to said trust property in said state. March, 1927.] MEYER v. SUPERIOR COURT. 787

The present proceeding was instituted in this court on October 18, 1926, by the filing of the application for a writ of prohibition herein and in which application the foregoing facts and proceedings are fully set forth. The respondents herein have filed both a demurrer and an answer, but as to the latter it presents no issues essential to the determination of the questions of law presented by the demurrer or necessary to the determination of this entire proceeding upon the merits thereof.

The primary inquiry herein in so far as the right of the petitioner Meyer, both in his personal and representative capacity, exists, relates to the nature of the several rights and interests which his deceased wife, Jennie C. Dunphy Meyer, had in the properties which were owned by her father, William Dunphy, and which were referred to and sought to be disposed of by his last will. The rights and interests of Jennie C. Dunphy therein which she held or occupied after the death of her said father were of a fourfold character: First, there was her right and interest therein as a cestui que trust under the terms of said will, and which under the terms thereof she was entitled to dispose of by will; second, there was her right and interest therein, or in so much thereof as became subject to the trusts created by said will in her capacity of trustee of such trusts under the terms of said will; third, there was her right and interest in so much of the community property of her deceased father as became the property of his widow, her mother, under the latter's election not to take under her husband's will, but to claim her undivided one-half of her said community property as his wife and surviving widow, and which property so claimed and taken she left upon her death in equal shares to her said children, of whom Jennie C. Dunphy was one; fourth, the right and interest which Jennie C. Dunphy as one of the heirs of William Dunphy would succeed to in the event that certain of her coheirs should die without issue or without direction by will as to the disposition of their respective shares in the properties of the Dunphy estate on the part of those of their number who were entitled to make such testamentary disposition under the terms of their father's will. It is conceded that the petitioner herein, X. Rodwell Meyer, either personally or in his representative capacity, has no other right in the remaining properties of William Dunphy, de- 788 MEYER v. SUPERIOR COURT. [200 Cal.

ceased, than those which he has derived from his deceased wife Jennie C. Dunphy Meyer as the sole devisee under her last will and as the executor of said will, and that whatever right he may have or assert to participate in any proceedings having for their purpose the selection of a trustee or trustees to fill the vacant trusteeships over the still existing trust, and the properties covered thereby; created by the will of William Dunphy, deceased, must have been derived from the foregoing source or sources alone, viz., those rights and interests to which he has succeeded as the sole devisee of his said wife under her last will or as the executor thereof. This being so, let us proceed to consider each in turn the nature, extent, and determination of the foregoing fourfold interests which Jennie C. Dunphy had during her lifetime in the properties of her father's estate. [1] First, as to her right and interest as one of the cestui que trustents under her father's will it may here be said that whatever the nature and extent of those rights, interests, and estates may have been while she was living, these have been changed by her death into rights, interests, and estates of an entirely different character. This change has been effected by and under the express terms of her father's will which provided in substance that she was to receive as a cestui que trust under the provisions of said will her allotted share of the income to be derived from the operation of such of his properties as came within the terms and control of said trusteeship, but that upon her death her allotted share of the principal of his estate "should be transferred and distributed as she may by will direct." There would seem to be no room for doubt that the above provision in the will of William Dunphy, deceased, would upon the death of his said daughter become effectual to terminate her relation as a cestui que trust under the aforesaid trust provisions of his said will and to work an immediate elimination of her allotted share in the principal of his estate from the control of said trust and to transfer the same and all right, title, and interest theretofore held, owned, and exercised by the trustees of said trust to those who were to be the beneficiaries under her will. It follows necessarily that as to the undivided one-fourth interest which Jennie C. Dunphy had as a cestui que trust in the income arising from the operations of said trust her right and relation thereto ended with her death, and in place and stead thereof there arose March, 1927.] MEYER v. SUPERIOR COURT. 789

and existed in her devisee the right to and ownership of an undivided one-fourth interest in the properties of said estate which has theretofore been subject to said trust, but which were released therefrom by the demise of the former cestui que trust of the income thereof. Her devisee thus became not a cestui que trust under said will, but a tenant in common with said trust and with the trustees thereof to the extent of an undivided one-fourth interest in the properties, real and personal, which prior to the death of his testatrix had been controlled by and subject to said trust. [2] Second, as to the rights and interests which Jennie C. Dunphy owned, held, and controlled in her capacity as one of the trustees, and later as a sole trustee under the will of her deceased father and under the terms of the trust created thereby, it must be conceded that these have fully ceased and come to an end by her demise and that none of her aforesaid rights and interests as trustee under said will have in any degree descended to or been succeeded to by her said devisee. [3] Third, as to those rights and interests in the properties and estate of William Dunphy, deceased, to which his widow claimed and had been allowed an undivided one-half as her community share thereof, and to an undivided one-fourth of which Jennie C. Dunphy succeeded as one of the heirs of her mother upon the latter's decease, Jennie C. Dunphy became to the extent of her inherited interest therein, as her mother before her had been, a tenant in common with the trustees in their ownership of that remaining portion of the properties of William Dunphy, deceased, which had come within the provisions of their trust; and she remained such tenant in common to the extent of her said undivided interest until her death, whereupon her said sole devisee succeeded to her said interest in the same capacity and not otherwise. [4] Fourth, as to those rights and interests to which Jennie C. Dunphy as one of the heirs of William Dunphy, deceased, would succeed in the event of one or more of her coheirs dying without issue or without such testamentary disposition as certain of them were entitled to make under the terms of their father's will, there would seem to be no doubt that these were remainders, existing in Jennie C. Dunphy at the time of her death, and to which her sole devisee would become entitled by the terms of her will; but though remainders these and each of them were 790 MEYER v. SUPERIOR COURT. [200 Cal.

and are at most merely contingent remainders and as such subject to be defeated by the death of certain of the coheirs leaving issue and by the making of testamentary dispositions by others of them entitled to so dispose of their interest in their father's estate. With respect to contingent remainders somewhat similar to these this court has held that a devise of a contingent estate to come into being only in the event of the devisee of the fee dying without leaving heirs, while termed a contingent remainder under our code, was rather in the nature of an executory devise at common law which did not require any precedent estate to support it but which could not of necessity arise at the death of the testator but only at the termination of the precedent interest, and when the contingency ceased to exist. (Jewell v. Pierce, 120 Cal. 79 [52 Pac. 132].) In the later case of Estate of Wilson, 184 Cal. 63 [193 Pac. 581], wherein a like devise of an estate contingent upon a prior devisee dying without heirs was interpreted, it was held that such estate and who were the owners thereof were to be determined as of the date of the death of the life tenant and termination thereby of the precedent estate. The rule laid down in these cases applies with even stronger force to the peculiar facts of the instant case, since the precedent interest of each of the children of William Dunphy, as we have seen, was not, during the lifetime of each, a direct interest in the corpus of the ancestor's estate but only in the income thereof and with respect to which corpus of the estate the remainder to which said Jennie C. Dunphy could only contingently succeed was one which for the first time would come into being when her coheir died without leaving issue, or, if entitled so to do, making a testamentary disposition of the share in the corpus of the estate, to the income of which only such coheir was entitled during his or her lifetime in the capacity of a cestui que trust of the trust estate.

[5] In the event that any one or more of these contingent interests had ripened during the lifetime of Jennie C. Dunphy through the death of any one or more of her coheirs under circumstances which would have called such contingent remainder or remainders into being she would not have, as to these, become a cestui que trust under the trust estate according to the terms of her father's will, but only a tenant in common as to such remainder with the trust estate. Her devisee could not in the nature of things become more March, 1927.] MEYER v. SUPERIOR COURT. 791

than this even though (which is not the case) such estate or estates in remainder had become vested through the termination of the precedent interest under circumstances which would have called them into being. It follows of necessity that the only interest which the petitioner herein, X. Rodwell Meyer, has either individually as sole devisee, or officially as executor under the last will of his deceased wife, is at best none other than that of a tenant in common with the trust estate of those properties of William Dunphy and of his wife and widow, Carmen Dunphy, with relation to which Jennie C. Dunphy Meyer was during her own lifetime such tenant in common or with relation to such portion of which as said Jennie C. Dunphy Meyer, by her will, made in conformity with her father's bequest, created her husband a tenant in common therein. X. Rodwell Meyer in his portion of the petition herein expressly alleges that he has succeeded to "an undivided one-fourth interest in and to the eighty thousand acres of said ranch owned and operated by said trust at the time of the death of said Jennie Carmen Dunphy Meyer." It is true that he also alleges that he is the owner of the contingent interests above referred to, but as to these, as we have seen, they have not yet ripened and may never ripen into a present estate and when, if ever, they do so ripen, such estate or interest as would then arise would amount to no more than merely the interest of a tenant in common with such trust in the corpus of the remaining properties subjected to such trust. We are not, therefore, called upon to pass upon the respondent's contention that the said petitioner is seeking remedies in this proceeding upon a statement of other matters than those considered by the Superior Court in making its several rulings which said petitioner is herein assailing, since at most said petitioner is none other than a tenant in common with said trust in the properties which are subject to its provisions.

[6] We are thus brought to the inquiry as to whether a tenant in common of property, the remaining undivided interest in which is held a trust estate, the trusteeship of which has become vacant, is either entitled of right to participate in proceedings in the Superior Court having jurisdiction over such trust instituted for the purpose of filling such vacancy, or is entitled to notice of such proceedings before such court or the judge thereof can acquire 792 MEYER v. SUPERIOR COURT. [200 Cal.

jurisdiction to proceed to fill such vacant trusteeships. We are satisfied that both upon reason and authority these questions must both be answered in the negative. A tenant in common has as such no interest in the title of his covenant to property held by them and each of them in that relation.

[7] It is hornbook law that the only unity of tenants in common in the property held by them as such by several and distinct titles is that of possession. (2 Blackstone's Commentaries, 191.) We are cited by the petitioners herein to no authority which goes to the extent of holding that a tenant in common in property, the other undivided interest wherein is held and owned in trust for the benefit of other persons than said tenant in common, has such an interest therein as would entitle him as a matter of right to dominate, dictate, or participate in proceedings for the appointment of trustees to be charged with the administration of such trust. On the other hand, we are cited by the respondents herein to cases arising in jurisdictions having laws relating to the creation and administration of trusts similar to our own which hold that a tenant in common with a trust in the ownership of property has no right as such to participate in or even to have notice of proceedings in a proper court for the appointment of trustees to fill existing vacancies in the trusteeship of such trust. The leading case upon this subject is that of Greene v. Borland, 4 Met. (45 Mass.) 330. In that case of testatrix created a trust over an undivided one-half of her property and estate, naming certain trustees thereof in her will. The other one-half of her said property and estate she devised in fee to her son, whom she also named as the executor of her estate. The trustees named in the will declined to act, whereupon the court appointed one Quincy as succeeding trustee and the latter brought suit against the son as tenant in common in possession of the whole property for an accounting. The son undertook to defend said suit upon the ground that the court had no jurisdiction to appoint such trustee without notice to him as such tenant in common. Under the Revised Statutes of the state of Massachusetts the court having jurisdiction over trusts "shall after notice to all persons interested appoint a new trustee." The court with this provision in mind held that the appointment of the trustee was valid as having been made with the consent of all parties interested in the trust and that the March, 1927.] MEYER v. SUPERIOR COURT. 793

defendant, either as a tenant in common in the property or as executor of the estate, was not a person in interest legally entitled to notice in order to give validity to the appointment of the trustee. In the case of Dexter v. Cotting, 149 Mass. 92–95 [21 N. E. 230], the supreme court of that state held that the phrase "persons beneficially interested in the trust" referred only to such parties as had a present vested interest in the trust fund and was not intended to include contingent remaindermen who might possibly become interested in the future. In the case of Matter of Earnshaw, 196 N. Y. 330 [89 N. E. 825], the court of appeal of that state held that under a statute empowering the court to appoint trustees of a vacant trust upon such notice to the beneficiaries of the trust as the court may direct, only those persons who were entitled to the income of the trust during their lives were entitled to such notice and that remaindermen were not entitled to notice of the appointment of trustees. In the case of Offutt v. Jones, 110 Md. 233 [73 Atl. 629], it was held by the court of appeals of that state that under a statute providing for the appointment of trustees of a trust estate upon the petition of any person interested in the trust property the court had jurisdiction upon the petition of a cestui que trust to appoint a trustee, but that the executor of the will or the remaindermen were not such necessary parties that their absence from the proceedings rendered the appointment void. In each of the jurisdictions from which the foregoing cases are cited there are express statutory provisions requiring notice to persons interested in the trust. Section 1702 of the Code of Civil Procedure of this state contains a like provision relating to the filling of vacancies in a trust created by will during the period when administration of an estate is pending, the provision therein being that such appointment may be made by the probate judge "upon the written application of any person interested in the trust filed in the probate proceedings and shall only be made after notice to all persons interested in the trust." It is to be noted, however, that the statute of this state contain no similar express requirement as to notice of other cases and that the only language therein out of which an implication would arise that notice of some sort would be requisite in order to entitle the court having jurisdiction over a trust in an estate, 794 MEYER v. SUPERIOR COURT. [200 Cal.

wherein administration is not pending, to appoint trustees to a vacant trusteeship therein is that provision in section 2287 of the Civil Code permitting *cestuis que trustent* over the age of fourteen years to make nominations to the court having statutory jurisdiction to appoint such trustees. We do not feel called upon herein to interpret such implication since we are of the opinion that even if notice is required in this as in other states having express statutes to that effect, such notice would only be necessary to be given to the *cestui que trustent* under the interpretation given to such statutes in the foregoing cases. [8] We therefore reach the conclusion in this case in disposing of the petition of X. Rodwell Meyer herein that he occupies no such relation to the trust or to the trust property involved in this proceeding as would have entitled him as a matter of right to maintain the action or proceeding instituted by him as plaintiff and against the *cestuis que trustent* of said trust for the appointment of a successor to the vacant trusteeship therein, and that as to whether or not the Superior Court should have sustained the demurrer of the defendants to his amended complaint in that proceeding is not a matter of jurisdiction which is reviewable in the instant proceeding; and that as to the right of said X. Rodwell Meyer, either individually or as the executor of his deceased wife's estate, to receive notice of the proceedings instituted by the *cestuis que trustent* themselves and among themselves for the appointment of a trustee to such vacant trusteeship he had no right to such notice as a prerequisite to the jurisdiction of the Superior Court, the respondent herein, to make such appointment and hence has no right in either his individual or representative capacity to maintain this proceeding. [9] With respect to the right of the Hibernia Savings and Loan Society, a corporation, and the corporation herein to be made a party to the proceedings for the appointment of a trustee over the trust estate upon the properties of which it holds several mortgages for the security of certain indebtedness to it incurred under the sanction of the court procedure by the former trustee, it would seem that but little remains to be said. The sole question presented in the instant proceeding is one of jurisdiction, and however advisable it might be for the court having jurisdiction over a trust estate to consider the interests of a large creditor of such estate in the matter March, 1927.] MEYER v. SUPERIOR COURT. 795

of the appointment of a successor to a vacant trusteeship therein, we are cited to no authority which renders it incumbent upon such court as a matter of jurisdiction to either notify such a creditor of or admit it to its counsels in making such appointment. We are cited to no authority, either statutory or otherwise, which confers upon a mere creditor or lienholder of a trust estate the right to call into question the jurisdiction of the court having power so to do to appoint trustees or to fill vacancies in the trusteeship of a trust or over the properties wherein the only interest of the party objecting to such jurisdiction is that above stated. As before stated, the questions involved in this proceeding are those of jurisdiction only and not of policy, and with the wisdom or prudence of the action of the respondents herein in the matter of the selection of trustees who are under its direction to administer this trust this court in the instant proceeding has nothing to do.

The only remaining question involved in this proceeding is as to the jurisdiction of the respondent court to appoint a receiver over the properties of the trust estate in a proceeding before it wherein all of the necessary and proper parties to such proceeding concur in the request for the appointment of such receiver. [10] We are advised of no provision in the statute relating to the appointment of receivers which imposes a jurisdictional requirement that other parties than the necessary and proper parties to the action or proceeding in question must be brought in as parties thereto or must receive notice of the consent application for the appointment of the receiver therein. If the receiver thus appointed is given larger powers than he should possess in his capacity as such, or is attempting to exercise powers beyond the proper scope of his appointment, parties who are injuriously affected thereby have ample remedies in the ordinary course of law. We find no merit, therefore, in the petitioners' contention that this court in this limited proceeding should interfere to restrain any threatened act in excess of his authority on the part of such receiver.

The application is denied.

Arthur Coats for Respondents.

LANGDON, J.—This is an appeal by plaintiffs from a judgment in an action to quiet title to certain real property in Sutter County, California, which judgment decreed that the plaintiffs have no right, title, or interest in said land and that the heirs of James W. Gaither and of M. E. Gaither are the owners of the same in fee, subject to the right of possession, for the purposes of administration, of the defendant E. E. Proper, as administrator of the estate of James W. Gaither, deceased, and of M. E. Gaither, deceased, and that said administrator is now entitled to the possession of said property.

The facts are undisputed and the appeal presents the single question of the construction of a deed.

On August 4, 1873, the land involved here, as a part of a larger tract, was the property of James W. Gaither, and on that date he and his wife, by good and sufficient deed, granted to the trustees of the Gaither School District a lot consisting of one acre and 106 square rods, situated in the northwest quarter of section 32, township 14 north of range 3 east, Mount Diablo meridian, and running south nineteen rods; thence east fourteen rods; thence north nineteen rods, MEMORANDUM CASES. 797

and thence west fourteen rods to the place of beginning. This deed contained the condition that said premises should be used for educational purposes only and that when they ceased to be so used, they should revert to the grantors thereof, their heirs and assigns.

According to the stipulation of the parties as to facts and the findings of the trial court, about a year after the execution of the deed above mentioned, Gaither and his wife granted and conveyed to Bethel Way "the Northwest quarter of section thirty-two, Township fourteen North, Range three east, Mount Diablo Meridian in Sutter County, California, containing 160 acres, less one acre and one hundred and six square rods deeded by said James W. Gaither and M. E. Gaither, his wife in the year 1873 to Gaither School District, said lot being the northwest corner of the above parcel of land."

There were no further conveyances from the Gaithers, and the plaintiffs, by mesne conveyances, have succeeded to all right, title, and interest of Bethel Way under the aforementioned deed to him made by Gaithers in 1873. In the meantime, as found by the trial court, the land granted to the school district had ceased to be used for school purposes for more than three years prior to the bringing of this action. The "school land" had reverted, therefore (Papst v. Hamilton, 133 Cal. 631 [66 Pac. 10]), and the question presented by the record is whether that reversionary interest remained in the heirs of Gaither or whether it passed by deed made in 1873 from Gaithers to Bethel Way and from Bethel Way, through successive transfers, to the present plaintiffs. The problem is determined by the language which we have quoted from said deed given by Gaithers to Way.

[1] This identical question was presented by the record in the companion case to this one (Hartwig et al. v. Central-Gaither Union School District et al., ante, p. 425 [253 Pac. 733]), which was brought by the present plaintiffs to quiet title to this same land against the school district and in which action this court has this day determined the effect of the deed from the Gaithers to Bethel Way. Both cases were submitted to this court, by stipulation, upon the same points and authorities and the decision of the one, necessarily, concludes the other.

Upon the authority of Hartwig et al. v. Central-Gaither Union School District et al., supra, and for the reasons 798 MEMORANDUM CASES.

THE COURT.—The sufficiency of the identical plans and estimates and the validity of the assessment levied upon plaintiff's lands thereunder are attacked upon this appeal by appellant herein upon substantially the same grounds as were urged in Ella L. Hershey et al. v. Reclamation District No. 108 et al., ante, p. 550 [254 Pac. 542]. [1] The main questions presented by this appeal were specifically disposed of in the case of Ella L. Hershey et al. v. Reclamation District 108 et al., supra. In appellant's opening brief he concedes the legality of the assessment levied upon all the lands within the district "for drains, levees, pumps and other matters incident to reclamation as the same had always been known and recognized prior to the amendment of section 3455, Political Code, as amended by the legislature of 1917 (Stats. 1917, p. 1197) and under the new section added to the Political Code by the legislature of 1921 . . . (Stats. 1921, p. 1590)." The objection specifically urged is to "that part of the assessment that has to do with the strictly irrigation features." No other questions not decided in the case above referred to are raised in appellant's opening brief. In the reply brief appellant questions the correctness of two find- 800 MEMORANDUM CASES.

SEAWELL, J.—This appeal is, with respect to the main legal questions presented, a counterpart of *Bailes v. Keck et al., ante*, p. 697 [51 A. L. R. 930, 254 Pac. 573], except that in the instant case defendants Keck and Millican are shown upon the face of the promissory note sued on to be guarantors rather than makers thereof. In this respect only the case differs from *Bailes v. Keck et al., supra*. The transaction out of which the note sprang, so far as a gleam of light is shed upon the former interrelated business connections of the parties to this and the companion action, appear not from the pleadings, but are referred to in affidavits, *pro and contra*, used upon a hearing of the motion to vacate the order dismissing the action after demurrer sustained upon refusal on the part of plaintiff to amend his complaint within the time allowed by the court.

The note was joint and several and was dated December 11, 1923, and was for the sum of $5,000, payable upon demand to the California National Bank of Long Beach. F. E. Brittain and Mary J. Brittain were the makers and J. L. Keck and E. E. Millican guarantors. Thereafter, it is alleged, said bank indorsed said note without recourse to one of its makers, to wit, F. E. Brittain, for a valuable consideration, and delivered said note into his possession. He, in turn, according to the allegations of the complaint, for a valuable consideration, indorsed and delivered said note to plaintiff, who became and is the owner and holder thereof. Interest has been paid thereon to the amount of $1,431.96 by someone not named. Judgment for the principal, interest, and counsel fees against guarantor Keck is demanded.

It is, therefore, unnecessary to restate the grounds upon which the judgment and order in that case were affirmed, and it is sufficient to say that the rule therein declared is applicable to and must rule our decision in the instant case.

INTEREST OF AGENT ADVERSE TO PRINCIPAL—DUTY TO DISCLOSE.—Under the statute, a party in his proposed employment as a real estate agent by other parties is barred from acceptance of employment, unless he discloses to his proposed principal the facts which may be adverse to the interest of the latter and after such disclosure is permitted by them to act as their agent.—Id.

3. EXCHANGE OF PROPERTIES—SECRET PROFITS—LIABILITY OF AGENT TO PRINCIPAL.—Where a real estate agent accepted employment to exchange real property owned by his principals and consummated an exchange for property which he himself owned, subject to a contract of sale to other parties, which contract he procured

a release from for a consideration, he is liable to his principals for secret profits made by him on the transaction, where he did not disclose the fact that he was the owner of the property being exchanged to his principals.—Id.

4. ACTION TO RECOVER SECRET PROFITS.—In this action by principals to recover secret profits alleged to have been made by their agent in an exchange of properties for them, it is held that the third amended complaint stated a cause of action and the court did not err in overruling a demurrer to it or denying a motion to strike out portions thereof.—Id.

5. VALUE OF LAND—IMMATERIALITY OF.—In an action against an agent for breach of trust and to recover secret profits obtained by him as a result of the agency relationship in the exchange of property of his principals for property owned by him, the value of the land is immaterial, as the principals are entitled to recover from the agent the difference between the price of the land purchased by him for them and the amount paid by the principals.—Id.

6. ISSUES—FINDINGS.—Where the complaint in such an action alleges a cause of action arising from the false and fraudulent representations and concealments of the agent by which the principals were led to believe that they were dealing with third parties, when in fact they were dealing with the agent, upon which issues the court found in favor of the plaintiffs, issues raised by further allegations of the complaint touching the agent's representations as to the acreage of the land received by the principals and the amount of personal property thereon were immaterial and findings thereon unnecessary, as the judgment would not in any way be affected by findings on immaterial issues.—Id.

7. EVIDENCE—LETTERS FROM AGENT TO PRINCIPALS.—In such a case, there was no error in excluding letters written by the agent to the principals requesting the latter to visit the former in order to adjust any grievance that might exist, where the letters were written long after the consummation of the transaction.—Id.

8. CONFLICTING EVIDENCE—RESOLVING IN FAVOR OF FINDINGS.—In such a case, any conflict in the evidence upon the issues covered by the findings must be resolved in favor of the findings; and it is held that the findings were amply supported by the evidence.—Id.

9. MEASURE OF DAMAGES—In such a case, the agent is properly held answerable to his employers for the full amount of his secret profits realized on the transaction which he as their agent and trustee conducted for them as principals and beneficiaries of the trust.—Id.

**ALIEN LAND LAW.**

1. APPLICATION TO CHINESE—TREATY WITH CHINA.—The Alien Land Law of this state (Stats. 1913, p. 206; Stats. 1921, p. lxxxiii), is applicable to subjects of China, and it does not violate any treaty agreement between the United States and that nation.—Mott v. Cline, 434.

2. CONSTRUCTION OF UNITED STATES—CHINESE TREATY.—The existing treaty between the United States and China does not guarantee to Chinese subjects the right to acquire, enjoy, or occupy agricultural lands; and the rights, privileges, and immunities accorded to them are such only as are specified by the treaty, to wit: personal security and protection in their property rights against spoliation.—Id.

3. CONVENTION COVENANT OF 1894—CONSTRUCTION.—The convention covenant of 1894 (28 U. S. Stats. at Large, p. 1210) between the United States and China, prohibiting the immigration of Chinese for a certain period and providing that those then in the United States under the treaty of 1881 should have for the protection of their persons and property all rights accorded citizens of the most-favored nation, excepting the right to become naturalized citizens, did not confer the right to acquire real property upon such Chinese.—Id.

4. RIGHT TO CARRY ON TRADE—RIGHT TO OWN OR LEASE HOUSES—AGRICULTURAL LAND.—The right to carry on trade or to own or lease and occupy houses, manufactories, warehouses, and shops, or to lease land for residential and commercial purposes, or to do anything necessary for trade, cannot be said to include the right to own or lease, or to have any title to, or interest in, land for agricultural purposes.—Id.

5. CONSTITUTIONAL LAW.—The Alien Land Acts of this state are not repugnant to any article of the federal or state constitutions.—Id.

6. RETROACTIVE EFFECT OF STATUTE—INTENT OF LEGISLATURE—POLICE POWER—OPTION TO PURCHASE LAND.—Whether the Alien Land Acts are retroactive, so far as an option to purchase land executed before the passage of the acts is concerned, depends upon the legislative intent and whether the objects sought to be attained are within the police power of the state; and while there is no direct language in the acts on this point, the general language implies 808
ALIEN LAND LAW.

ALIEN LAND LAW (Continued).

an intention to prevent an executory contract from ripening into a fee simple.—Id.

7. NATURE AND SCOPE OF POLICE POWER.—The police power of the state, being in its nature a continuous one, must ever be reposed somewhere, and cannot be barred or suspended by contract or irreparable law; and it is to be presumed that parties contract in contemplation of the inherent right of the state to exercise the police power that the sovereign always reserves to itself for the protection of peace, safety, health, and morals, and its effect cannot be nullified in advance by making contracts inconsistent with its enforcement.—Id.

8. EXERCISE OF POLICE POWER—ALIEN LAND ACTS.—The adoption of the Alien Land Acts by this state was a lawful exercise of the police power, as ownership of the soil by persons morally bound by obligations of citizenship is vital to the political existence of the state.—Id.

9. CONSTRUCTION OF ACT.—Conspiring to effect a transfer of real property or an interest therein, in violation of the Alien Land Law, which section 10 of the Act of 1920 makes a crime punishable as a misdemeanor or felony, is the only act that is made a public offense and penalized by imprisonment or fine, or by both, the exaction imposed for all other violations of the act inhibiting transfers being that the conveyance is rendered void as to the state and the real property escheats to the state upon action brought by the attorney-general or district attorney of the county in which the violation occurs.—Id.

10. OPTION TO PURCHASE LAND—EXECUTION BEFORE PASSAGE OF ALIEN LAND LAW—ABSENCE OF CONSPIRACY.—Where a lease of agricultural land, containing an option to purchase in favor of a Chinese who is ineligible to citizenship, was made prior to the adoption of the Alien Land Laws of this state, the assignment of said option after the passage of such laws to one eligible to exercise all the rights and privileges of citizenship and the exercise of the option by such person does not violate the conspiracy provisions of said law, for under statutes forbidding ownership of land by aliens an alien grantee takes a defeasible estate free from attack by anyone except the government in escheat proceedings, and if said alien before the power of the state is invoked in an escheat proceeding conveys the property to a person eligible to hold it the infirmity of title is removed.—Id.

11. ASSIGNABILITY OF OPTION.—An option to purchase agricultural land contained in a lease of such land, where the contract contains no features of personal trust or confidence reposed in any of the parties and requires nothing more than a mere routine of paying APPEAL.                                                                 809

ALIEN LAND LAW (Continued).

money, is assignable, and the option provision is severable from all other provisions of the lease.—Id.

12. SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE—TENDER OF RENT—INSUFFICIENCY OF—SECTION 1935, CIVIL CODE.—Under section 1935 of the Civil Code, where the holder of an option to purchase contained in a lease exercises the option between rent days a proportionate amount of rent must be tendered for the period of occupancy before exercise of the option or specific performance will not be decreed.—Id.

13. WAIVER OF OBJECTION TO TENDER—BURDEN OF PROOF.—The burden is on the party asserting a waiver of objection to a tender to prove the same.—Id.

APPEAL.

1. BILL OF EXCEPTIONS—SPECIFICATIONS OF INSUFFICIENCY OF EVIDENCE—SECTION 648, CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE.—Specifications of the insufficiency of the evidence to support the findings are expressly required by the provisions of section 648 of the Code of Civil Procedure relating to bills of exceptions, which provisions are mandatory, and in the absence of such specifications the question of the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain the findings of the trial court cannot be considered upon an appeal from the judgment.—Schultz v. City of Venice, 50.

2. PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS.—Where the owners of marsh-land caused the same to be reclaimed and laid out in lots, blocks, streets, and intercommunicating waterways converging into an artificial lagoon and connected with the adjacent ocean, in conformity with a map of the tract filed for record, and caused the banks of these waterways to be cemented and planted with trees, vines, and shrubbery, and to be ornamented with a particular type of architecture, causing archways and bridges to be built in harmonious designs at such elevations as not to interfere with the use of the waterways for boating, canoeing, and other aquatic purposes, the lagoon being provided for swimming, and other water sports, the streets intersecting the canals being adapted for residential purposes and the adjacent lands subdivided into residential lots and the unique features advertised in the sale of the lots, in a suit against a city built upon the area to prevent it and its officers from proceeding to convert the waterways into surface streets, the sufficiency of the evidence to support the findings cannot be reviewed on appeal, in the absence of specifi- 810 APPEAL.

## APPEAL (Continued).

cations of the insufficiency of the evidence, where the answers sufficiently tendered the issue as to the original dedication of the waterways and adjacent premises to public uses, and the findings covered the issues and showed that the case was tried upon the theory that the issues were sufficiently tendered by the pleadings and that therefore, findings were required thereon.—Id.

3. ORDER DENYING MOTION FOR NEW TRIAL—REVIEW OF.—Since the 1915 amendment to section 963 of the Code of Civil Procedure (Stats. 1915, p. 209), an order denying a motion for new trial is not an appealable order; but by the amendment of 1915 to section 956 of the Code of Civil Procedure (Stats. 1915, p. 328), such an order is reviewable on an appeal from the judgment.—Hall v. Imperial Water Co., 77.

4. ORDER REFUSING TO VACATE JUDGMENT—NONAPPEALABLE ORDER—EXCEPTION.—Under the general rule, an order refusing to vacate and set aside a judgment is not an appealable order, but there is the exception to this rule that, where the record on appeal from the judgment would not disclose the grounds of the motion, the order is appealable.—Id.

5. MOTION FOR NEW TRIAL—MOTION TO VACATE JUDGMENT—NONAPPEALABLE ORDER.—Where one of the grounds for a motion for new trial was the disqualification of the trial judge, an appeal will not lie from an order denying a motion to vacate the judgment upon this ground, as the denial of the motion for a new trial can be reviewed on an appeal from the judgment.—Id.

6. MOTION TO VACATE JUDGMENT—TIME.—A motion to vacate a judgment not void on its face must, by analogy with the provisions of section 473 of the Code of Civil Procedure, be made within six months from the entry of the judgment.—Id.

7. RECORD ON APPEAL—MOTION TO STRIKE OUT.—Where the proceedings on a trial were reported by the official reporter to the point of submission of the case for decision, and thereafter the court set aside the submission for the sole purpose of receiving the report of engineers appointed by it to report on certain incidental matters, which report was thereafter verified by witnesses and received in evidence upon a hearing at which the official reporter was not present, but which fact the parties had knowledge of and offered no objection to, a motion to strike out the whole transcript on appeal, prepared under section 953a of the Code of Civil Procedure, will be denied, where the portion which included the proceedings down to the first submission were properly certified by the judge as being true and correct and were sufficient from which to decide the appeal on the merits, and the other part APPEAL.                                                                 811

APPEAL (Continued).

of the transcript was severable therefrom.—Muchenberger v. City of Santa Monica, 261.

8. UNDERTAKING ON APPEAL—FAILURE OF SURETIES TO JUSTIFY IN TIME—NEW UNDERTAKING—SUPERSEDEAS.—Where an appellant, in good faith, gives notice and presents the sureties on his appeal bond given to stay execution one day too late, under the erroneous belief that he was within time, a writ of supersedeas will issue to preserve the status quo, upon the appellant giving a new undertaking in accordance with the order of the court.—Foster v. Fernandes, 274.

9. INSUFFICIENT BRIEFS—FRIVOLOUS APPEAL.—Upon this appeal it is held that the appellant's brief fails to conform to the rules of the supreme court with reference to summarizing the evidence, and that an examination of the record on appeal discloses that the appeal is entirely without merit and is frivolous.—Graham v. Bonestell, 309.

10. SUPERSEDEAS—WHEN GRANTED.—A writ of supersedeas may be granted in a proper case only to restrain and prevent the enforcement of a judgment or order by the court below or its officers pending an appeal; and if the judgment or order appealed from is self-executing and no process is required to be issued for its enforcement no supersedeas is allowed.—Hulse v. Davis, 316.

11. EXECUTION—ORDER QUASHING.—An order quashing execution has an intrinsic effect and is self-executing. Process is not required for the enforcement of such an order and pending the determination of an appeal therefrom a writ of supersedeas may not properly be issued to stay proceedings in the matter.—Id.

12. AGREED STATEMENT OF FACTS—QUESTION OF LAW.—Where a case is submitted upon an agreed statement of facts without any other evidence whatever, findings of fact are unnecessary, and the only question before the court is as to what the law is applicable to those facts, and any findings of fact made by the court under these circumstances may be disregarded.—Crawford v. Imperial Irr. Dist., 318.

13. ORDER MODIFYING DIVORCE DECREE—CUSTODY OF CHILD—MOOT QUESTION—DISMISSAL.—Where the interlocutory and final decrees in a divorce action awarded the custody of a minor child to the plaintiff and thereafter the court modified the decrees by transferring the custody of the child to the defendant for a certain period, an appeal from the modifying order will be dismissed where it appears that the period for the changed custody has elapsed, the question involved having become moot.—Pengelly v. Pengelly, 381.

14. CONFLICTING EVIDENCE—FINDINGS.—It is well settled that where the evidence is contradictory the findings of the trial court are conclusive on appeal.—McKean v. Alliance Land Co., 396. 812 APPROPRIATION.

## APPEAL (Continued).

15. FAILURE TO FILE BRIEF—ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE—REVERSAL BY CONSENT.—Upon this order to show cause why the judgment should not be reversed for failure of respondent to file his brief, the order appealed from was reversed by consent.—Search v. Pickwick Stages, Inc., 520.

16. FAILURE TO FILE BRIEF—ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE—DISCHARGE OF.—Upon this order to show cause why the judgment herein should not be reversed for failure of the respondent to file his brief, the respondent having by permission of court afterward filed his brief, the order to show cause was discharged.—Fred W. Hanger Motors Co. v. Reidy, 521.

17. RECORD.—While it is the rule that in the absence of a transcript or bill of exceptions containing all the evidence it will be presumed upon appeal that the evidence adduced at the trial was competent and material and was sufficient to sustain the facts found, such rule has no application in a case where the trial court found that a writing, which respondent claimed waived appellant's right of action, was duly executed by the appellant and where the intention of the appellant in signing and delivering the writing can be ascertained from the clear and unambiguous language of the writing.—Fraters Glass etc. Co. v. Southwestern Const. Co., 688.

18. RECORD ON—REPORTER'S TRANSCRIPT.—An appeal from a judgment taken under the alternative method will not be dismissed upon the ground that the reporter's transcript is incomplete where the transcript contains the judgment-roll.—McKeon v. Sambrano, 739.

19. MOTION FOR AFFIRMANCE OF JUDGMENT—RULE—PRACTICE.—It is the practice of the supreme court ordinarily to deny a motion for affirmance of the judgment appealed from for the reason that consideration of such motion necessarily involves an examination of the record and briefs of counsel as to the merits of the appeal resulting in the advancement of the hearing of the particular appeal over many other appeals preceding it on the calendar; but it is held that the motion in this case may properly be considered and upon the consideration of the same the judgment should be affirmed.—Id.

ATTACHMENT.

1. CONTRACTS—PLACE OF PAYMENT.—Where the right to an attachment depends upon the contract sued upon being made "payable in this state" it is not enough that the money be payable wherever the defendant may be found, and therefore payable in this state, but the contract must provide either in terms or by necessary implication that the obligation is payable in this state.—Snapp v. Kidder, 724.

2. CONSTRUCTION OF CONTRACT—WHEN MONEY NOT PAYABLE IN STATE. In an action to recover a sum of money alleged to be due for the use of a privilege or gambling car connected with a traveling show, whereby the terms of the contract between the parties, executed in another state, a certain sum was to be due and payable on a certain day of each week during the show, and the contract contemplated weekly payment of said sums at such place or places as the show might be operating when the same fell due, but the contract itself does not indicate the places where the show visited nor the record disclose that any part of the amounts sued for was earned or became payable in this state, a writ of attachment was improperly issued in the action.—Id.

BAIL.

1. ACTION UPON BAIL UNDERTAKING—PLEADINGS—RELEASE FROM CUSTODY.—In an action upon an undertaking for bail an averment in the complaint of release upon or by reason of the execution and delivery of the undertaking is indispensable, and in the absence of such an allegation a demurrer to the complaint on that ground should be sustained.—People v. McDonald, 716.

2. INFERENTIAL ALLEGATION—APPEAL.—In an action to recover upon a bail bond, although the complaint is deficient in lacking a direct averment upon that subject, where it, by implication, reveals that the person for whom the undertaking has been furnished had, in fact, been released from custody, the allegation, in the absence of a demurrer on that ground, will be held to be sufficient on appeal.—Id.

BANK ACT. See Banks and Banking, 4, 5, 7-11, 16. 814
BANKS AND BANKING.

# BANKS AND BANKING.

1. **REGULATIONS—POLICE POWER.**—The business of banking affects so intimately the commercial welfare and business interests of the people as to render it a proper subject of regulation by the state in the exercise of the police power.—Bank of Italy v. Johnson, 1.

2. **LIMIT OF REGULATIONS—CONSTITUTION.**—The power of the state to regulate banking business is supreme, subject to no limitation so far as the fourteenth amendment to the constitution of the United States is concerned, except that such regulation must be reasonable.—Id.

3. **BRANCH BANKS—PROHIBITION AND REGULATION OF.**—Since the state may prohibit branch banks entirely, it may make and enforce any regulations short of prohibition, provided the same be reasonable and uniform.—Id.

4. **BANK ACT—ESTABLISHMENT OF BRANCH BANKS—DISCRETION OF SUPERINTENDENT OF BANKS—PUBLIC CONVENIENCE AND ADVANTAGE.**—Under the bank act (Stats. 1909, p. 88), a bank is prohibited from establishing or maintaining a branch office, either in the city of the head office or elsewhere in the state, except upon the written approval of the superintendent of banks, which (a) may be given or withheld in his discretion, and (b) shall not be given by him until he has ascertained to his satisfaction that the public convenience and advantage will be promoted by the opening of the branch office.—Id.

5. **PERMITTING BRANCH BANKS—LEGISLATIVE POLICY.**—The question of permitting branch banks at all is one of legislative policy on the part of the state.—Id.

6. **DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY—SECTION 9 OF BANK ACT.**—The discretion vested in the superintendent of banks by section 9 of the bank act is a lawful delegation of authority to him, but such authority is not without its limitations in law, independent of the statute and in the statute itself, and includes the limitation that the discretion shall be exercised impartially and in such manner as not to infringe upon any constitutional rights of an applicant.—Id.

7. **ADOPTION OF RULES—CURTAILING DISCRETION.**—The superintendent of banks may not by the adoption of any rule or policy or procedure so circumscribe or curtail the exercise of his discretion under the statute as to prevent the free and untrammeled exercise thereof in every case, for an attempt to do so would be for him to arrogate to himself a legislative function.—Id.

8. **EXERCISE OF DISCRETION—TIME.**—The superintendent of banks may not refuse to exercise the discretion conferred upon him by the bank act when called upon to do so by an application duly presented to him, but must act upon such application within a reasonable time.—Id. BANKS AND BANKING. 815

## BANKS AND BANKING (Continued).

9. **PUBLIC CONVENIENCE AND ADVANTAGE—DETERMINATION OF.**—The legislature has not attempted to define the phrase "public convenience and advantage," as used in section 9 of the bank act, and it is the duty of the superintendent of banks, in the exercise of his power, to ascertain the facts in each case, in which he performs an executive or administrative function and not a judicial one.—Id.

10. **DUTY OF SUPERINTENDENT—DETERMINATION OF PUBLIC CONVENIENCE AND ADVANTAGE—EXTENT OF INTEREST.**—In determining the question of public convenience and advantage, on an application to establish a branch bank, the superintendent of banks should first consider the interest of the public immediately contiguous to the proposed branch bank or of the public reasonably subject to service by it, but he may take into consideration the question whether the convenience and advantage of the people of the entire state would be promoted or retarded by the unlimited establishment of state-wide branch banks.—Id.

11. **DE NOVO RULE—GUIDE FOR DEPARTMENT—VALIDITY OF.**—The rule called the "de novo rule," adopted by the superintendent of banks, providing in effect that any bank whose main office is located within the limits of a city will be permitted to extend into other parts of that city with branches, on application to the superintendent of banks, and without acquiring another bank, but any bank located within a city desiring to extend a branch into another city of the state where competition now exists will be required to acquire an existing bank before the request will be granted, subject to exceptions within the discretion of the superintendent, is but a declaration of policy on the part of the superintendent of banks, which is within his power to prescribe, as a rule or guiding consideration of his department, and as a notice to applicants as to the showing necessary to be made.—Id.

12. **ADMINISTRATIVE BOARDS AND OFFICERS—RULES AND REGULATIONS.**—The authority of an administrative board or officer, such as the superintendent of banks, to adopt reasonable rules and regulations which are deemed necessary to the due and efficient exercise of the powers expressly granted cannot be questioned. This authority is implied from the power granted.—Id.

13. **FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD—CONTIGUOUS TERRITORY RULE.**—The rule of the Federal Reserve Board known as the "contiguous territory rule," providing that that board will as a general principle restrict the establishment of branches, agencies, or additional offices by its member banks or trust companies to the city of location of the parent bank and the territorial area within the state contiguous thereto, as said territory has been defined in the board's previous resolution, excepting in instances where the state banking authori- 816

ties have certified and the board finds that public necessity and advantage render a departure from the principle necessary or desirable, is a proper administrative regulation.—Id.

14. ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICER OR BOARD—PROMULGATION OF RULES—POWER.—An executive or administrative officer or board may not, in the promulgation of rules, change, alter, amend, or extend his or its statutory powers.—Id.

15. "DE NOVO RULE"—DISCRETION OF SUPERINTENDENT OF BANKS.—The so-called "de novo rule" of the superintendent of banks does not assume to lay down a general rule legislative in character limiting the exercise of the discretion reposed in him by section 9 of the bank act. The word "require," as contained in the rule, cannot be construed to have a meaning materially different from the statutory word "promoted."—Id.

16. APPLICATION FOR BRANCH BANK PERMITS—MANDAMUS—PLEADING. In a proceeding in mandamus to compel the superintendent of banks to issue to the petitioner certain permits for the establishment and maintenance of branch banks in certain places, the petition for the writ is vulnerable as against a general demurrer where it is not alleged therein that the capital and surplus of the petitioner were at the time of making said applications equal to or in excess of the amount required by section 9 of the bank act for the opening of said branches or that such facts were known to the respondent, or that the petitioner had paid or tendered for payment the fees required by said section 9 or that the petitioner had presented all of the essential facts to the respondent upon which he might properly exercise his discretion, or that the respondent was in possession of the facts of his own knowledge from which the only reasonable conclusion could be drawn that the public convenience and advantage would be promoted by the granting of said applications. These omitted allegations, or the substance thereof, were essential to state a cause of action against the respondent.—Id.

17. AMENDMENTS TO PETITION—SUFFICIENCY OF.—In such a case, where in advance of a ruling on the demurrer, the petitioner introduced its evidence on the theory that all matters essential to state a cause of action were in issue and the respondent introduced evidence to meet the petitioner's showing thereon, and the petitioner thereafter, by permission of court, filed amendments to the petition supplying the omitted allegations essential to state a cause of action, under the circumstances, the respondent is entitled to have a ruling on his demurrer, and it is held that the petition as amended states a cause of action and the demurrer is overruled.—Id.

200 Cal.—52

## BANKS AND BANKING (Continued).

18. **PLEADING—DENIALS.**—In such a case, where the respondent in his answer denied the material allegations of the petition which are in controversy, under the practice, the allegations of the amendments filed to conform to the proof are deemed denied.—Id.

19. **DENIAL OF APPLICATION—REASONS FOR.**—The reasons assigned by the superintendent of banks for the denial of applications for permits for branch banks do not preclude him from thereafter setting up and relying upon any and all legal reasons for denying the same in a proceeding in *mandamus* to compel him to issue said permits.—Id.

20. **REASONS FOR DENIAL—FINDING OF PUBLIC CONVENIENCE AND ADVANTAGE.**—In such a case, where the petitioner by its pleading and proof has thrown the case wide open on the question of whether as a matter of law on the face of the record and regardless of the "*de novo* rule," the respondent was compelled to find that the public convenience and advantage would be promoted by the opening of said branches, reasons assigned previously by the respondent in denying said applications should not be held to be determinative of the rights of the parties.—Id.

21. **MANDAMUS—DISCRETIONARY POWERS.**—It is the general rule that the writ of *mandamus* may not be employed to compel a public officer possessing discretionary power to act in a particular way. The court in such a proceeding may compel him to act, but it may not substitute its discretion for the discretion vested in such officer. An important exception to the rule, however, is that if the facts as admitted or proved be susceptible of but one construction or conclusion the right to the writ becomes a matter of law and the officer may be compelled to act in accordance with the facts as admitted or established.—Id.

22. **EVIDENCE—PUBLIC CONVENIENCE AND ADVANTAGE.**—In an original proceeding in *mandamus* in the supreme court to compel the superintendent of banks to issue certain permits to the petitioner for the establishment of branch banks in certain localities, where the court is called upon to determine the character and sufficiency of the evidence to justify the writ as against the respondent, it is governed by the rule that if there be any substantial evidence in the record which would have supported a conclusion on the part of the respondent that public convenience would not be promoted by the opening of such branches, the writ must be denied.—Id.

23. **DISCRETION OF BOARDS OR COMMISSIONERS—INTERFERENCE WITH BY COURTS.**—When subordinate boards or commissioners are by statute invested with discretion with respect to the exercise of their powers, courts will not interfere with such discretion in the absence of grave reasons tending to show that fraud, corruption, improper motives, or influences, plain disregard of duty, gross 818 BAYS.

abuse of power, or violation of law entered into or characterized the determination of such body.—Id.

24. **LETTER FROM SUPERINTENDENT OF BANKS—ADMISSIBILITY OF.**—In this proceeding in *mandamus* to compel the superintendent of banks to issue permits for branch banks at certain places, it is held that a letter written by the respondent to the Federal Reserve Board, with reference, among other things, to the former's previous granting of a permit to the petitioner for a branch bank at a certain place, was properly admitted in evidence.—Id.

25. **ABSENCE OF PERMIT FROM FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD—INSUFFICIENT REASON FOR DENIAL OF WRIT.**—In such a proceeding, the fact that the Federal Reserve Board has not granted its permission to the petitioner to open branch banks at the locations in question is not a sufficient reason for denying the writ, as the Federal Reserve Board is an official body entirely independent of any state authority, and the statutory powers and duties of the superintendent of banks should be exercised and discharged independently of any authority having no lawful jurisdiction over him.—Id.

BILL OF EXCHANGE.

1. **DISHONOR OF BILLS—WAIVER OF PROTEST—IMPLIED FINDINGS.**—In an action to recover a certain sum paid by plaintiff to defendant bank for foreign bills of exchange, by returning a verdict favorable to the plaintiff, the jury impliedly determined that the evidence in the case was sufficient to show a dishonor of the bills of exchange by the drawee bank and a waiver by the drawer bank of the formality of protest.—Redo y Cia v. First Nat. Bank, 161.

2. **MEASURE OF DAMAGES—LAW APPLICABLE.**—In such a case, where the bills of exchange antedated the adoption by this state of the Uniform Negotiable Instruments Law, the measure of damages recoverable from the drawer upon dishonor must be found in the law in effect prior to the adoption of the former law.—Id.

3. **SECTIONS 3234 TO 3239, CIVIL CODE—CONSTRUCTION.**—Under sections 3234 to 3239 of the Civil Code, the amount recoverable upon the dishonor bills of exchange by a foreign drawee is the value of the foreign money in which the bills of exchange were expressed, at the time the bills were presented to the foreign drawee for payment, together with damages of fifteen dollars upon each BRIDGE AND HIGHWAY DISTRICTS. 819

**ENCROACHMENT—ACTION TO REMOVE—RELIEF.**—Where plaintiffs and defendants are adjoining owners of real property and the former claim that the latters' building encroaches upon their lot, in a suit to enjoin defendants from depriving plaintiffs of their property and for abatement of said building as a nuisance and to recover damages, a judgment establishing the correct boundary line and awarding plaintiffs damages in the sum of ten dollars is proper, where there is no direct evidence that the encroachment of the building from one-half to five-eighths of an inch caused any actual damage to plaintiffs.—McKean v. Alliance Land Co., 396.

See Judicial Notice, 1; Navigable Waters, 3, 4, 8; Reclamation Districts. 9.

**BRIDGE AND HIGHWAY DISTRICTS.**

1. **PETITION FOR ORGANIZATION—WITHDRAWAL OF SIGNATURES.**—Under the act of 1923 (Stats. 1923, p. 452), as amended in 1925 (Stats. 1925, p. 714), for the incorporation and management of bridge and highway districts, signers of the petition for the formation of such a district cannot legally withdraw their names from such petition after the same has been certified as sufficient by the county clerk of the county in which it was circulated and presented to and filed with the Secretary of State as provided by said act.—Doyle v. Jordan, 170.

2. **INTENTION TO JOIN DISTRICT—ORDINANCE OF SUPERVISORS—ATTEMPTED REPEAL.**—Where the board of supervisors of a county has passed an ordinance to the effect that the county intends to unite with such other counties as may adopt like ordinances to form a bridge and highway district under the act of 1923, and amendment thereto, and the petition provided for by said ordinance has been circulated, signed, certified, and presented to the Secretary of State, it is too late for said board to repeal said ordinance, as the powers granted it under the statute were exhausted by passing the first mentioned ordinance.—Id. 820 BRIDGE AND HIGHWAY DISTRICTS.

BRIDGE AND HIGHWAY DISTRICTS (Continued).

3. OFFER TO JOIN DISTRICT—ATTEMPTED WITHDRAWAL—CONSTRUCTION. There is no merit in the contention that the passage of a board of supervisors of an ordinance, under said act, declaring it to be the intention of the county to join a bridge and highway district is but an offer or proposal on the part of the county and that it may be withdrawn or revoked at any time before its acceptance.—Id.

4. OFFER—ACCEPTANCE.—Conceding that an ordinance passed by a board of supervisors declaring it to be the intention of the county to join with other counties in the formation of a bridge and highway district to be an offer or proposal only, where it was made in accordance with the statute and made "to unite with such other counties as may adopt like ordinance," and other counties adopted like ordinances and following the passage of said ordinance took all proceedings required of them by said statute in order to join said bridge and highway district, the offer made by the first county was accepted by the other counties and an attempt of the board of supervisors of the first county to withdraw therefrom was too late and accordingly ineffectual.—Id.

5. ACCEPTANCE OF OFFER BY OTHER COUNTIES—NUMBER.—Where it was the clear intention of a board of supervisors to adopt an ordinance in compliance with the terms of the statute to unite with such other counties as might adopt like ordinances for the formation of a bridge and highway district, it was not impossible to accept said offer so long as any one or more other counties passed a similar ordinance, and the passage of such ordinance by any of said other counties was of itself an acceptance of the offer of the first county to join in the district.—Id.

6. DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT.—Although a description of the project for which it is proposed to form a bridge and highway district is not set forth nor mentioned in either the ordinance passed by the board of supervisors or in the petition circulated and signed by the electors, where there is officially of record in each of the counties of the district a document among the proceedings to incorporate the district in which the object and purpose or the project for which said district is to be formed is definitely and distinctly set forth, this sufficiently complies with the statute.—Id.

7. CONSTITUTIONALITY OF STATUTE—DUE PROCESS—TAKING OF PRIVATE PROPERTY—TITLE OF STATUTE.—The contention that the act for the incorporation of bridge and highway districts is unconstitutional because it seeks to deprive persons of their property without due process of law and to take private property for private uses, and that more than one subject is embraced within the title of the statute, cannot be maintained.—Id.

8. BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF DISTRICT—LEVYING TAXES—CONSTITUTIONAL LAW.—Even if an attempt to clothe the directors of a BROKER'S COMMISSIONS. 821

## BRIDGE AND HIGHWAY DISTRICTS (Continued).

bridge and highway district with power to levy taxes is beyond the constitutional authority of the legislature, this question cannot be raised in a proceeding instituted for the sole purpose of testing the validity of those provisions of the act providing for the incorporation and formation of the district, as the district when incorporated may be a valid and constitutional agency of the state, although some of the powers with which the legislature may have sought to invest the directors thereof are invalid and unconstitutional, which defects may be cured by further legislation.—Id.

9. EQUALIZATION OF ASSESSMENTS.—The objection that the act for the organization of bridge and highway districts is unconstitutional in that it contains no provision for the equalization of the assessments of property in the different counties embraced in the district cannot be maintained in proceeding for the sole purpose of testing the validity of the provision of the act for the incorporation and formation of such a district.—Id.

10. CONSTITUTIONAL LAW—ARTICLE XI, SECTION 13, CONSTITUTION.—The act for the incorporation and management of bridge and highway districts does not violate article XI, section 13, of the constitution.—Id.

## BRIEFS. See Appeal, 9, 15, 16.

## BROKER'S COMMISSIONS.

1. FINANCIAL ABILITY AND WILLINGNESS OF PURCHASER—SUFFICIENCY OF EVIDENCE.—In this action by a real estate broker to recover commissions for services in the proposed sale of real and personal property, it is held that the evidence was sufficient to make a *prima facie* showing that the proposed purchasers were ready, able, and willing to complete the transaction had the seller not repudiated the same, and that the burden was cast upon the defendant to overcome the showing, and that as the showing was not overcome, it is sufficient to base a finding upon in favor of the plaintiff.—Russell v. Ramm, 348.

2. PLEADING—DEFECT IN AMENDED COMPLAINT—CURING BY ANSWER.—In such a case, the failure of an amended complaint to contain an averment that the plaintiffs procured a purchaser for the property referred to in the agreement and described in the amended complaint who was ready, willing, and able to purchase the same, is cured by an answer admitting the execution of the agreement and authority in the plaintiffs to negotiate the sale upon the terms specified, but expressly denying that plaintiffs procured, at the time and upon the terms and conditions specified in the agreement, a party willing, able, and ready to purchase the prop- 822
BROKER'S COMMISSIONS.

BROKER'S COMMISSIONS (Continued).

erty, especially where the case was tried upon the theory that such issue was tendered by the pleadings.—Id.

3. ANSWER TO AMENDED PLEADING.—The rule, as generally approved by the authorities, is that a plea to the original declaration will be treated as a plea to an amended declaration, if applicable and responsive thereto, but if not responsive it will be treated as a nullity.—Id.

4. DEFECTIVE PLEADING.—OBJECTION TO EVIDENCE.—Where a complaint attempts to set forth matters essential to the statement of a cause of action, but does not fully measure up to indispensable requirements, and yet contains an allegation from which an essential fact is necessarily to be implied, an objection to evidence upon the ground that such issue has not been raised in the complaint should be as specific as an objection to a complaint by demurrer upon the ground of uncertainty or ambiguity.—Id.

5. CONFLICTING EVIDENCE—APPEAL.—Where there is a substantial conflict in the evidence, the decision of the jury or trial court upon the facts is conclusive and binding upon the courts of review.—Id.

6. REFUSAL OF OWNER TO SELL—RIGHT OF BROKER TO COMMISSION.—Where the owner of the property, in such a case, refuses to sell to the purchaser procured by the broker upon any ground other than that of the inability of the proposed purchaser to purchase, the owner cannot, in an action against him by the broker for compensation, successfully set up such ground as a defense, unless the fact constituting that ground is included in the agreement between the owner and broker as one of the terms or conditions which must be met or complied with by the broker before he has earned or is entitled to compensation for his services.—Id.

7. REFUSAL OF WIFE TO JOIN IN CONVEYANCE.—It is the general rule in such a case that the refusal of the wife of the owner to join in a conveyance of the property to the proposed vendee does not in itself operate to deprive the broker of his right to compensation.—Id.

8. DEMAND FOR ABSTRACT OF TITLE—CONSTRUCTION OF CONTRACT.—In such a case, where the contract authorizing the brokers to obtain the purchasers expressly provided that the owner should furnish to any proposed buyer a "deed and abstract, or certificate of title, showing clear title in" the owner to date, a demand by the proposed purchasers, as a condition to the execution of a contract of sale, for a certificate of title, was within the terms of the contract, and the contention that this provision meant that the owner was to furnish an abstract or certificate of title only when the deed was tendered, and not at the time the contract of sale was executed, cannot be maintained.—Id. CHARITIES. 823

## BROKER'S COMMISSIONS (Continued).

9. DESCRIPTION OF LAND—UNCERTAINTY—CURING OF.—Much greater liberality is allowed in construing and curing defective descriptions of property in brokers' contracts than in deeds to land, for, so far as the statute of frauds is concerned, the terms of the employment are the essential part, and such contracts will not be declared void merely because of a defect, uncertainty, or ambiguity in the description of the property to be sold or exchanged when such defect can be cured by the allegation or proof of extrinsic facts and circumstances.—Id.

10. STATUTE OF FRAUDS—PLEADING.—In order that the defendant in any case may avail himself of the benefit of the statute of frauds, where it does not appear from the face of the complaint that the statute has not been complied with, it is necessary that it should be pleaded and proved.—Id.

See Contracts, 17.

## BUILDING CONTRACTS.

1. ACTION TO FORECLOSE—SUFFICIENCY OF EVIDENCE—FINDINGS.—In this action to foreclose a written contract in the nature of a mortgage for the construction of a building, it is held that the evidence was sufficient to sustain the findings, that the court made all appropriate findings, and that there were no errors of law occurring at the trial which would warrant a new trial of the case.—Chester R. Pyle Co. v. Fossler, 204.

2. OMITTED FINDING.—Omission to find upon an issue, when such finding would not necessitate any change in the judgment, does not warrant a reversal or a new trial, as, if findings are made upon issues which determine the case, other issues become immaterial, and a failure to find thereon does not constitute prejudicial error. Id.

3. DEVIATION FROM CONTRACT—WAIVER.—Waiver always rests upon intent and knowledge, and it is held in this case that there was neither an express agreement nor such conduct on the part of the defendants, under the facts found, as would show a waiver by the defendants of the condition of the contract requiring deviations and changes to be ordered in writing.—Id.

### CHATTEL MORTGAGES.

1. **LEASED LAND—SURRENDER OF LEASE—WHEN MORTGAGE NOT LIEN ON CROPS.**—Where a sublessee of agricultural land, during his occupancy of the land, executes a chattel mortgage upon the crops to be grown thereon, but after summer-fallowing the land surrenders his sublease without planting any crops, the mortgage does not attach to crops afterward planted by a new tenant.—First. Nat. Bank of Oakdale v. Brashear, 389.

2. **CROP MORTGAGE—EFFECT OF.**—While a crop mortgage may be made to cover crops thereafter to be sown and grown upon leased land, and such a mortgage has a potential existence during the period prior to the actual planting of the seed, such mortgage does not pass the point of potential existence prior to the actual planting of the land.—Id.

3. **INTEREST OF MORTGAGEE—LIEN.**—The general rule is that the holder of a crop mortgage has no interest in nor lien upon the land, but the lien of such mortgage attaches only to the interest which the mortgagor may have in the crops after they have come into being by the planting of the seed wherefrom they are grown. Id.

4. **LEASE OF AGRICULTURAL LAND—CHATTEL REAL—HUSBAND AND WIFE—CONTROL OF HUSBAND.**—A lease of agricultural land is a chattel real with which the lessee has full power to deal so far as his wife is concerned.—Id.

5. **SURRENDER OF LEASE—FAILURE OF WIFE TO JOIN IN—ABANDONMENT.**—Even if a written and recorded surrender of lease of agricultural land executed by the lessee was void, because not signed by the lessee's wife, where, after such written surrender, both the lessee and his wife abandoned the leasehold premises and the landlord immediately accepted such surrender and resumed possession of the premises, all interest of the lessee thereupon terminated, and with such termination of the lease all rights of the mortgagee under a mortgage executed by such lessee and his wife as to crops not yet planted came to an end.—Id.

1. **TITLE—EVIDENCE.**—In an action in claim and delivery to recover possession of an automobile, or the value thereof, where the defendant's asserted ownership and right of possession of the ma- COMPETENCY. 825

## CLAIM AND DELIVERY (Continued).

chine was alleged by him to exist from or prior to the commencement of the action, he was entitled to show by evidence any source of his said title, whether derived from the plaintiff or not.—Kenny v. Christianson, 419.

2. **SALES—AUTHORITY OF AGENT—EVIDENCE.**—In such a case, where the evidence was sufficient to show that the automobile in question was delivered by the plaintiff, or her agent, to a factor for sale, the latter was entitled as such factor to deliver possession of the car to such purchaser as would pay the price, and to execute a bill of sale to him, and the fact that the factor after receiving the purchase price embezzled it does not render the purchaser liable for the same.—Id.

3. **TRANSFER OF TITLE—MOTOR VEHICLE ACT—FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH.**—While a compliance with section 45, subdivision e, of the Motor Vehicle Act of 1925, is essential to complete a transfer of title to a motor vehicle, the failure of the transferee to procure the registration certificate does not render his right to the possession of the car so incomplete as to make the assertion thereof unavailing to him in an action by the vendor to recover the automobile actually sold and delivered in good faith and for a full consideration.—Id.

4. **PLEADING—DEFENSE.**—In such a case, where the plaintiff bases her alleged right of recovery in the first instance upon her original claim of ownership and her contention that the person through whom the defendant acquired title had no authority to dispose of the same, the defendant is not required in his pleadings to anticipate such other contentions as the plaintiff may seek to rely upon when her main reliance has failed, and which other contentions do not appear upon the face of her complaint.—Id.

CONTEMPT.

REVIEW OF PROCEEDINGS—REMEDIES.—The remedy of one charged with contempt of court is to first present his defense upon a hearing of the contempt proceedings, and then, if found guilty of the contempt, to apply to a higher court for a writ of certiorari or habeas corpus.—Wessels v. Superior Court, 403.

CONTINGENT REMAINDERS. See Estates of Deceased Persons, 64-66.

CONTRACTS.

1. EXCHANGE OF REAL PROPERTY—CONSTRUCTION OF INSTRUMENT—OFFER.—Where an owner of real property, desiring to exchange it for that of another, executes a writing by which she agrees to execute and deliver in trust a deed of her property to the other party to be held by the trustee until such time as the other party, who is traveling in a foreign country, can be communicated with and a deed of his property made to the former, which instrument is executed by one signing as agent for the absent party, the writing does not constitute an agreement of sale CONTRACTS. 827

CONTRACTS (Continued).

and purchase between the parties, but a mere offer to exchange properties, which offer can be revoked at any time prior to acceptance, as the contract lacks consideration in that the second party gives no enforceable or any other promise to the first party.—Bandy v. Westover, 222.

2. ATTEMPTED WITHDRAWAL OF OFFER — NOTICE.—In such a transaction, notice by the first party that she will not make the exchange and that the transaction be canceled, given to parties whom the court finds to be agents of said first party, is ineffective in transmitting notice to the second party, his agent, or to the escrow party.—Id.

3. ACCEPTANCE OF OFFER.—In such a case, where the second party accepts the offer in accordance with its terms before its withdrawal, the contract becomes binding upon the parties and authorizes the escrow-holder to deliver the respective deeds to the grantees named therein.—Id.

4. DELIVERY OF PAPERS IN ESCROW — DELAY — WAIVER.—In such a case, the claim that because the deed and contract of the first party were not actually delivered to the escrow bank named in the contract prior to the date of a letter of withdrawal written by the first party to her agents, the letter should be held effective against the other party to the exchange, because the party holding the papers became the agent of the first party to effect the escrow delivery, cannot be sustained, where it is found that when the deed and offer were executed they were delivered to the agent of the second party, who receipted for them as held in escrow, and later said agent, on the request of the first party, while still retaining the papers, indorsed on the original offer certain matters, and other transactions occurred during said time between the first party and said agent, as under the circumstances the objection to the delay in delivering the escrow to the bank was waived.—Id.

5. ACTION FOR CANCELLATION OF DEED—FAILURE TO MAKE RESTORATION.—In such a case, there is no justification for a judgment in favor of the first party canceling the deed executed by her, while she continues to hold title to the property of the other party.—Id.

6. REVOCATION OF OFFER—DELAY IN ACCEPTANCE.—The claim in such a case that the offer was revoked by the unreasonable lapse of time between the making and acceptance of it is without merit, where the offer recognized that the party to whom it was made was in a foreign land and would not return for some months. Reasonable time is a relative term depending upon the terms of the offer and other circumstances.—Id.

7. ISSUES—PLEADING—FINDINGS.—Where no issue was made in the complaint in such case as to the claim of unreasonable delay in 828
CONTRACTS.

## CONTRACTS (Continued).

accepting the offer, no occasion existed for a special finding thereon.—Id.

8. **COUNTERCLAIMS**—CONSTRUCTION OF SECTIONS 438, 439, CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE.—The provisions of section 439 of the Code of Civil Procedure to the effect that if defendant omits to set up a counterclaim arising out of the transactions set forth in the complaint as the foundation of plaintiff's claim neither he nor his assignee can afterward maintain an action against the plaintiff therefor, make it important that section 438 of the Code of Civil Procedure be not extended to any case which does not fairly come within its provisions.—Id.

9. **ACTION TO CANCEL DEED AND ESTABLISH TITLE**—IMPROPER COUNTERCLAIM.—In a suit in equity for the cancellation of a deed to real property, and in effect to establish title thereto, counterclaims for a money judgment on account of sums expended by defendant in connection with the operation of another piece of property are improper, although they remotely arise from the same transaction, but not from the same "foundation" that plaintiff's claim rests upon, and where they would not, if established, qualify or defeat the judgment to which plaintiff would otherwise be entitled.—Id.

10. **INSUFFICIENCY OF PLEADING.**—Even if the allegations of the alleged counterclaims, in such a case, be considered as a cross-complaint, the pleading could not be sustained, where it wholly fails, standing alone, to state facts sufficient to constitute an independent cause of action.—Id.

11. **FAILURE TO DEMUR OR MOVE TO STRIKE OUT.**—The failure of a plaintiff to demur or move to strike out or otherwise plead to counterclaims of defendant does not preclude her from making the contention that the same are unauthorized under the system of pleading in this state.—Id.

12. **INFLUENCING LEGISLATION—VALIDITY OF CONTRACT.**—The employment of persons to influence legislation or to influence decisions of the Land Department, or even the decisions of judicial tribunals, in a proper way, is not against sound public policy, and a contract having such purpose is valid.—Crawford v. Imperial Irr. Dist., 318.

13. **IRRIGATION DISTRICT**—RESOLUTION EMPLOYING PERSON TO INFLUENCE LEGISLATION—PROPER PURPOSES—PRESUMPTIONS.—Where a resolution of an irrigation district employing a person to secure the passage of legislation desired by the district plainly limits the services of the employee to appearing on behalf of the district before the various committees of Congress having under consideration a certain bill and presenting facts and arguments in support CONTRACTS. 829

## CONTRACTS (Continued).

of said bill, the services are not against public policy or good morals and are legal.—Id.

14. **IMPERIAL IRRIGATION DISTRICT—AUTHORITY TO EMPLOY AGENT.**—The Imperial Irrigation District had authority, under its general powers, to employ an agent to appear before the appropriate committees of Congress to present facts and arguments in support of the Swing-Johnson Bill, which bill has for its purpose the enabling of the federal government to enter into a contract with the district which is the only means whereby said district can hope to obtain a supply of water for irrigation and domestic purposes and to secure protection from destruction of the lands therein by the flood waters of the Colorado River.—Id.

15. **FINDINGS—SUFFICIENCY OF EVIDENCE.**—In this action to recover upon two claims, one for boring a well and the other for the purchase price of a pump for the well, it is held that the evidence was sufficient to sustain the findings in favor of the plaintiff.—Farren v. Hobbs, 428.

16. **SALES — STATUTE OF FRAUDS.**—In such case, where the evidence showed that the pump in question was shipped to the purchaser, that he received it at the station, paid the freight on it, had it hauled to his ranch, installed it and tried it out, found that it exhausted the water quickly and would have to be placed deeper, and ordered several extensions for this purpose, that he operated the pump for several months, made no objection to it except that it was not satisfactory in the fact that it used too much power, but did not deny liability under the bills rendered to him until action was brought thereon, the facts and circumstances take the case out of the statute of frauds.—Id.

17. **BROKER'S COMMISSIONS — TIME OF PAYMENT.**—Where a written agreement provided for the payment of a certain sum for the procuring of a loan on real property "when said transaction is consummated on or before" a specified date, the promisors testifying that the purpose of the quoted provision was to negative any liability on their part in the event they should not consummate the purchase of property upon which the loan was to be a lien, and the promisee testifying that there was no such understanding but that its purpose was merely to delay payment of his fee until consummation of the sale and not to make payment contingent upon that event, the consummation of the sale was not a condition precedent to recovery of the commission, but the commission was earned when a loan was secured and the money deposited within the required time, regardless of whether or not the sale was ever consummated.—Wallace v. Zinman, 585.

18. **CONSIDERATION—CHARACTER OF.**—Under ordinary circumstances a conveyance of property to a third party by the releasee in con- 830
CONTRACTS.

## CONTRACTS (Continued).

sideration of the release of certain obligations by the releasor would be a sufficient consideration, as it implies detriment to the releasee.—Colley v. Chowchilla Nat. Bank, 760.

19. **PROMISSORY NOTE—CANCELLATION—NATIONAL BANK—ULTRA VIRES ACT.**—Where a national bank took an assignment of a contract to purchase property as security for a promissory note held by it, its agreement thereafter made to cancel the obligation on the note in consideration of the transfer by the maker of the note of the property covered by the contract of purchase to a party not shown to have any other connection with the transaction is in legal effect the making of a gift of its capital assets by the bank, beneficial only to the third party and without benefit to itself, and the contract is *ultra vires* and void.—Id.

20. **CORPORATIONS—ULTRA VIRES ACT—DEFINITION OF.**—The acts of a corporation may be said to be *ultra vires* in different senses: first, when the act is not within the scope of the powers of the corporation to perform under any circumstances, or for any purpose, in which case the act is void *in toto* and the corporation may avail itself of the plea; or in the second case, an act is sometimes *ultra vires* with reference to the rights of certain parties when the corporation is not authorized to perform it without their consent, or with reference to some specific purpose when it is not authorized to perform it for that purpose although, fully within the scope of the general powers of the corporation, with the consent of the parties interested, or for some other purpose, and in the latter case the right of the corporation to avail itself of the plea will depend upon the circumstances of the case.—Id.

21. **NOVATION—DEFINITION—PLEADING.**—Under section 1530 of the Civil Code, novation is a substitution of a new obligation for an existing one, made as provided by section 1531 of said code, and it must be pleaded either expressly or by unequivocal implication.—Id.

22. **INSUFFICIENT SHOWING OF NOVATION.**—Where the only thing shown is that a bank, after accepting a quitclaim deed, asserted in an action brought by it the right to possession of the premises covered by the deed, which was consistent with its rights under the terms of a certain contract of sale, the facts do not show a novation under which said bank agreed to pay the obligation of certain notes held by another bank and secured by a contract of purchase of said property, the obligations of which notes the latter bank agreed with the makers thereof would be canceled in consideration of the execution by the makers of said notes of said deed of the property to the first mentioned bank.—Id. CORPORATIONS. 831

## CONTRACTS (Continued).

23. FINDINGS—INSUFFICIENCY OF EVIDENCE.—In this action it is held that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the findings.—Id.

24. ASSIGNMENT OF CONTRACT TO PURCHASE LAND—INTERESTS OF ASSIGNEE.—The assignment of a contract to purchase real property gives the assignee an equitable lien or mortgage upon said real property, enforceable against the property in the hands, not only of the original contractor, but also in the hands of his heirs, administrators, executors, voluntary assignees and purchasers, or encumbrancers with notice, actual or constructive.—Id.

25. NATIONAL BANKS—TAKING OF SECURITY FOR UNSECURED DEBT—ESTOPPEL.—A national bank would be estopped to deny its power, in getting security for a pre-existing, unsecured debt, to make a valid agreement to release the debtors from personal liability where they had in good faith executed a contract to their detriment by which they transferred property to a third party, as a national bank may lawfully do many things in securing and collecting its loans, in the enforcement of its rights and the conservation of its property previously acquired, which it is not authorized to engage in as a primary business.—Id.

## CORPORATIONS.

1. LICENSE TAX—CONSTITUTIONAL LAW.—The provisions of the Corporation License Tax Act of this state requiring foreign corporations to pay an annual license fee, which fee is in nowise regulated by either the amount of property owned, capital employed, of business done within the state, but is predicated solely upon the authorized capital stock of the corporation, is violative of the commerce clause and the fourteenth amendment to the constitution of the United States, in that it lays an unwarranted burden upon interstate commerce, taxes properly outside the state over which the state of California has no jurisdiction, and denies to persons within the jurisdiction of California equal protection of the laws.—Perkins Mfg. Co. v. Jordan, 667. 832
COSTS.

CORPORATIONS (Continued).

2. VALIDITY OF LICENSE TAX LAW—STATUTE.—In order that an act proposing a license fee upon foreign corporations desiring to transact intrastate business in this state be valid the tax must bear at least some relation to property owned and used and business carried on or proposed to be carried on within the state of California.—Id.

3. FILING FEES—PRIVILEGE OR EXCISE TAX—TESTS.—The contention cannot be maintained that a different principle may apply in the case of filing fees graded on authorized capital than in the case of a privilege or excise tax based upon authorized capital. The effect upon interstate commerce and upon equal protection of the law to persons in the several states is the test, and neither the name nor the aim of the state tax can suffice to prevent consideration of the necessary effect and consequences of the state statute.—Id.

4. MEASURE OF TAX—AUTHORIZED CAPITAL.—The authorized capital stock of a foreign corporation is not a proper foot rule for measuring license tax fees required to be paid by the corporation. Id.

5. LICENSE TAX FEE—SEVERABLE PROVISIONS OF ACT—MANDAMUS.—The provisions of the corporation license tax act of this state with regard to the license fee of foreign corporations is severable from the other provisions of the act and mandamus is the proper remedy to test the validity of such provisions.—Id.

See Contracts, 20; Irrigation Districts, 2; Telegraphs and Telephones.

COSTS.

1. ERRONEOUS INSERTION IN REMITTITUR—REMEDY.—Upon an appeal from an order vacating a judgment for costs in a will contest, where the supreme court in affirming the order did not exercise its discretion in awarding costs pursuant to section 1720 of the Code of Civil Procedure, it was error for the clerk of said court to insert in the remittitur a provision for costs on appeal, in accordance with the rule covering ordinary civil actions; and the proper remedy to correct said error was a motion in the supreme court to recall the remittitur and to strike therefrom the provision for costs.—Estate of Johnson, 307.

2. JURISDICTION—AWARD OF COSTS.—Where the supreme court has lost jurisdiction of an appeal from an order vacating a judgment for costs, in a contest before probate of a will, it may not exercise any discretionary power in awarding costs therein, but an appropriate order may be made by the trial court with reference to the costs on appeal, in the exercise of its discretion under section 1720 of the Code of Civil Procedure.—Id.

1. **JUDICIAL COUNCIL AMENDMENT—CONSTRUCTION.**—It sufficiently appears from the body of the "Judicial Council Amendment" to the constitution (article VI, sections 1a, 6, 7, and 8), when read as a whole, that it was intended to have application to the entire judicial system of the state of California, including the Supreme Court and the several District Courts of Appeal; second, that it was intended to confer upon the judicial council certain powers such as are enumerated in subdivisions 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 of section 1a of said amendment; and, third, that it was intended to confer upon the Chairman of the Judicial Council certain powers and duties having reference to whatever state of congestion he may find to exist in the calendars of the courts or judges of this state with a view to a speedy relief of such congestion, and "to expedite judicial business" by so doing.—Fay v. District Court of Appeal, 522.

2. **POWERS OF ASSIGNED JUDGES—CONSTRUCTION.**—The phrase "to assist a court or judge whose calendar is congested," used in the "Judicial Council Amendment" to the constitution, because of its generality and absence of specific application and intendment, sheds but little light upon the proper interpretation to be given the particular provision of the constitution in which it is found, but the implication is clear from the subsequent provision of the amendment, which declares that the several judges thus assigned "to assist a court or judge whose calendar is congested" are to "sit and hold court as assigned," in other words, that said judges shall exercise judicial functions while operating under such assignment.—Id.

3. **ASSIGNMENT OF JUDGES—ACTING AS PART OF COURT.**—Judges assigned to assist a court or judge whose calendar is congested, under the "Judicial Council Amendment" to the constitution, exercise their judicial functions under such appointment in the tribunal as constituted by the constitution.—Id.

4. **STATUTORY CONSTRUCTION.**—In interpreting the "Judicial Council Amendment" to the constitution, it should be treated as a whole and considered in the light of previous interpretations of the provisions of article VI of the constitution, which it purports to amend; and it should be construed in the light of whatever evils or defects in the administration of justice it is found to have been designed to remedy.—Id.

COURTS (Continued).

5. CHANGE IN LAW—INTENT.—Whatever may have been the intent of the proponent of a particular change in a law must at the last analysis be derived from the language of the proposed enactment purporting to make such change.—Id.

6. REPEALS BY IMPLICATION—RULE.—Repeals by implication are not favored and are recognized only when there is an irreconcilable conflict between two or more legislative enactments.—Id.

7. EXPRESS REPEAL OR MODIFICATION.—When in any enactment there appears an express modification or repeal of certain provisions in a former enactment, such express modification or repeal of the portions thus affected will be held to disclose the full intent of the framers of the later enactment as to how much or what portion of the former it was intended to modify or repeal.—Id.

8. CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION 6 OF JUDICIAL COUNCIL AMENDMENT.—By the terms of section 6 of the "Judicial Council Amendment" to the constitution, the previously existing provisions of the constitution respecting Superior Courts are expressly modified and to that extent repealed in so far as these related to the number of superior judges who might function in said court in the several counties of California.—Id.

9. ASSIGNMENT OF JUDGES—NUMBER—POWER OF CHAIRMAN OF JUDICIAL COUNCIL.—The express provisions of section 6 of the "Judicial Council Amendment" to the constitution, read in connection with the language of section 1a of said amendment, renders fully applicable the rules forbidding repeals by implication.—Id.

10. POWER OF CHAIRMAN OF JUDICIAL COUNCIL.—The power with which the Chairman of the Judicial Council is invested, by the "Judicial Council Amendment" to the constitution, is that of assigning judges or justices "to assist" the Supreme Court and the several District Courts of Appeal, as these courts were theretofore constituted under the terms of the constitution prior to said amendment, whenever the calendars of said tribunals have become congested.—Id.

11. STATUS OF ASSIGNED JUDGES.—In making the assignment of any justice or judge or of any number of them "to assist" the appellate tribunals, the Chairman of the Judicial Council was empowered to invest the persons so selected and assigned with no other or different official relation to such courts than that held by the already regularly constituted members thereof, which was merely that of blending into the group constituency thereof in order, in that relation, to exercise the judicial function.—Id.

12. JUDGES PRO TEMPORE—CONSTRUCTION OF CONSTITUTION.—Under the "Judicial Council Amendment" of the constitution, it was not only the intention to retain the former constitutional provisions relating to the appointment of justices pro tempore, but to so broaden the former provisions as to authorize the selection of CRIMINAL LAW. 835

## COURTS (Continued).

justices or judges *pro tempore* to assist the Supreme Court and District Courts of Appeal when their calendars were congested, although the regularly constituted justices of said courts who were thus, for the purpose of hearing particular causes or calendars, replaced were neither disqualified nor unable to act.—Id.

13. **STATUTORY CONSTRUCTION.**—Between two apparently conflicting interpretations of a law equally adaptable, that one is to be preferred which will give effect to the entire language thereof, rather than that which would destroy any portion of it and to that extent defeat the legislative intent.—Id.

14. **ORDER ASSIGNING JUDGES—CONSTRUCTION OF.**—An order made by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, acting *ex officio* as chairman of the Judicial Council, assigning certain Superior Court judges to assist a District Court of Appeal, if construed to refer to these judges in their individual relation to said court, is a proper exercise of power under the "Judicial Council Amendment" to the constitution.—Id.

15. **ORDER OF DISTRICT COURT OF APPEAL.**—An order of the District Court of Appeal which in effect authorizes three Superior Court judges, assigned by the Chairman of the Judicial Council in said court to assist it, as a group, to sit as a court, and not to sit and act in that individual relationship to said court which each of them would otherwise have occupied as justices *pro tempore* under the terms of the constitution before the "Judicial Council Amendment," is invalid.—Id.

16. **JUDICIAL COUNCIL—CONSTITUTIONAL LAW — CONSTRUCTION.**—Upon the authority of *Fay v. District Court of Appeal*, ante, p. 522, it is ordered that a like order and writ issue in this case.—Landon v. District Court of Appeal, 798.

See Banks and Banking, 23; Municipal Courts; Rules of Court, 1.

## CRIMINAL LAW.

1. **ACCOMPLICE—SECTION 1111, PENAL CODE.**—Under section 1111 of the Penal Code one who is liable to prosecution for the identical offense charged against the defendant on trial in the case in which testimony of such person is given, is an accomplice.—People v. Allison, 404.

2. **BURGLARY—ENTRY OF RAILROAD CAR—SECTION 459, PENAL CODE.**—Under section 459 of the Penal Code, every person who enters any railroad car with intent to commit grand or petit larceny, or any felony, is guilty of burglary.—Id.

3. **ENTRY OF CAR—SUFFICIENCY OF EVIDENCE.**—One who standing outside a railroad car receives from the hands of another inside the car stolen goods taken from the car will be held to have entered the car and is guilty of burglary.—Id. 836
CRIMINAL LAW.

## CRIMINAL LAW (Continued).

4. **ACCOMPLICE—SPECIAL VERDICT—INSTRUCTIONS.**—In a criminal prosecution, where there is no conflict of evidence upon the question, it is error for the court in its instructions to submit to the jury the question of whether a certain witness was an accomplice in the commission of the crime charged, as the question is one of law for the court to say whether or not the acts make the witness an accomplice.—Id.

5. **MURDER—CONVICTION AND SENTENCE TO DEATH—MOTION TO SET ASIDE PROCEEDINGS—WRIT OF CORAM NOBIS.**—In a prosecution for murder, in which defendant was convicted of murder of the first degree with the death penalty imposed, a motion made after denial of a motion for a new trial and sentence to set aside the judgment and to return the case to the time of arraignment, as far as the legal status is concerned, is an application for a writ of coram nobis.—People v. Sandoval, 730.

6. **MOTION TO SET ASIDE JUDGMENT—INSUFFICIENT SHOWING.**—In a prosecution for murder, where the defendant, after a plea of not guilty, was given a full and fair trial, in which he and other witnesses for him testified, and he being represented at the arraignment and from that time on by counsel appointed for him by the court, a motion, after a verdict of murder of the first degree, denial of a motion for a new trial, and sentence of defendant to death, made by counsel appearing amicus curiae, to set aside the judgment and restore the case to its status upon arraignment, upon the ground that the defendant had plead not guilty by mistake and had desired to plead guilty, should not be granted under the circumstances, as it has no merit in law or in fact.—Id.

7. **SUFFICIENCY OF EVIDENCE.**—In a prosecution for murder, where the testimony of an eye-witness to the entire tragedy was introduced, which, although containing certain inconsistencies, the jury was entitled to believe, and the confession of the defendant, several times repeated, that he had slain his common-law, wife because of jealousy over her attentions to another man and of her threatened intent to leave him, which confessions were made under circumstances leaving little doubt as to their truth, were introduced in evidence, the evidence was sufficient to sustain a verdict of guilty of murder of the first degree without recommendation of the jury.—Id.

8. **FORMS OF VERDICT—SIGNING BY JUDGE BY MISTAKE.**—In a prosecution for murder, where five different forms of verdict were submitted to the jury, the fact that the judge's signature had been inadvertently misplaced upon two of the forms of verdict furnished to the jury does not constitute prejudicial injury sufficient to justify a reversal of the case, where the judge read the forms of verdict to the jury and explained in his instructions DEEDS. 837

DEEDS.

1. DESCRIPTION—EXCEPTIONS—CONSTRUCTION.—Where a deed conveys "the northwest quarter" of a certain section of land, "less one acre and one hundred and six square rods" previously deeded by the grantors to another party, there is no ambiguity in the description and it will be construed as granting the quarter-section, less the one acre, more or less.—Hartwig v. Union School Dist., 425.

2. RESERVATION IN GRANT—INTERPRETATION—SECTION 1069, CIVIL CODE.—Under section 1069 of the Civil Code, a reservation in a grant is to be interpreted in favor of the grantor.—Id.

3. GRANT FOR SCHOOL PURPOSES—REVERSION OF TITLE.—Where a grant of land was made to a school district with the condition in the deed that the premises should be used for educational purposes only and that when they ceased to be so used they should revert to the grantors, their heirs and assigns, and thereafter the grantors conveyed to other parties the section of land in which the tract granted to the school district was located, excepting therefrom the latter tract, upon the ceasing of use of the land conveyed for school purposes it reverted to the original grantors.—Id.

4. ACTION TO SET ASIDE—FRAUD—UNDUE INFLUENCE—CONFLICTING EVIDENCE.—In this action to set aside a deed upon the ground of fraud and undue influence, lack of consideration, and lack of delivery, it is held that the case presents such a conflict of evidence that the findings and judgment in favor of the plaintiff should be upheld on appeal.—Johnston v. Field, 644.

5. BUILDING RESTRICTIONS—CHANGE OF NEIGHBORHOOD.—Where a tract of land was subdivided and laid out for residential purposes and restrictive covenants running with the land were inserted in all deeds by which parts of said tract were conveyed, prohibiting until a certain time the construction of any structure but residences in the restricted area, a change in the uses to which the property 838

DEEDS (Continued).
in the neighborhood is being put of such nature that it is no longer residence property renders it unjust, oppressive, and inequitable to give effect to the restrictions, if such change has resulted from causes other than their breach.—Downs v. Kroeger, 743.

6. INJUNCTION.—In such a case an injunction will not issue to restrain the defendant from completing a store building upon his lot, where the evidence shows, and the court finds, that defendant's property is essentially business property, and that if he is restrained from using it for the only purpose for which it is now suitable and available, he will be irreparably damaged and deprived of any use whatsoever thereof.—Id.

7. JUDGMENT—SCOPE AND EFFECT OF.—In determining the scope and effect of a judgment, the entire judgment-roll may be looked to for the purpose of its interpretation; and it is held in this case that the judgment is supported by the findings when examined and considered with the record as a whole and it can only be construed to harmonize with them.—Id.

8. DESCRIPTION—CONSTRUCTION.—In this action to quiet title, the judgment is affirmed on the authority of Hartwig et al. v. Central-Gaither Union School District et al., ante, p. 425.—Hartwig v. Proper, 796.

See Contracts, 1, 5.

DEFAULT.

1. MOTION FOR RELIEF—DISCRETION.—Motions for relief from default, under the remedial provisions of section 473 of the Code of Civil Procedure, are addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court, and an appellate court will not, in the absence of a clear showing of abuse in the exercise thereof, disturb the action of the court below; but it is the policy of the law to favor, wherever possible, a hearing on the merits, and an appellate court is much more disposed to affirm an order when the result is to compel a hearing upon the merits, than when the default is allowed to stand.—California Nat. Bank v. El Dorado Lime etc. Co., 452.

2. BILLS OF EXCEPTIONS—PREPARATION AND SERVICE—TIME—SECTION 1054, CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE.—Section 1054 of the Code of Civil Procedure limits the power of the trial court, without the consent of the adverse party, to extending time for the preparation and service of the proposed bill of exceptions to thirty days.—Id.

3. QUESTION OF LAW—DISCRETION.—Where a trial court denies a motion to set aside a default solely for the reason that the default was the result of a mistake of law, it does not exercise the discretion vested in it by section 473 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Id.

4. ILLEGAL EXTENSION OF TIME—RELIANCE UPON—MISTAKE OF LAW. Although it is not within the power of a trial court to grant an DISMISSAL. 839

## DEFAULT (Continued).

extension of time to prepare and serve a proposed bill of exceptions beyond thirty days, where it does so and the party in good faith relies upon the void order, the case comes fairly within the remedial provisions of section 473 of the Code of Civil Procedure.—Id.

## DISMISSAL.

1. **DELAY IN BRINGING ACTION TO TRIAL**—Section 583, Code of Civil Procedure—Construction.—The mandatory provisions of section 583 of the Code of Civil Procedure do not require the dismissal of an action which has not been brought to trial within five years after the granting of a motion for a new trial.—Allyne v. Superior Court, 661.

2. **APPLICATION OF SECTION 583, CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE.**—The plain and obvious purpose of section 583 of the Code of Civil Procedure is to regulate the matter of compulsory dismissals only under one set of circumstances, to wit, where an answer has been filed and the action has not been brought to trial within five years thereafter, other sections in the same chapter of the code providing for dismissals under other circumstances; and if none of said sections pertaining to dismissals cover a particular case where more than five years have elapsed since the entry of the order granting a new trial, it is the duty of the trial judge to determine the question as to the reasonableness of the delay, and his determination cannot be disturbed by an appellate court.—Id.

3. **MANDAMUS—PETITION.**—The petition for a writ of mandate must state specific facts sufficient to justify the granting of relief sought, and make a clear *prima facie* case to warrant the alternative writ; and in a proceeding in *mandamus* to compel the superior court to 840
DISSOLUTION.

DISMISSAL (Continued).

dismiss a certain action upon the ground that it has not been brought to trial within five years after the granting of a motion for a new trial, the petition is insufficient to warrant the relief asked where it it framed on the theory that there is a mandatory duty upon the trial court to dismiss the action under section 583 of the Code of Civil Procedure and it does not allege facts sufficient to show that the trial court abused the discretion which it had in the matter.—Id.

See Promissory Notes, 4.

DISSOLUTION. See Partnership, 1.

DIVORCE.

1. PROCEEDING IN REM—DETERMINATION OF STATUS OF PARTIES.—A divorce proceeding, in so far as it relates to the marriage relation of the parties and the termination of the marriage status, is a proceeding in rem. Such an action is brought for the purpose of establishing judicially the matrimonial status of the parties, and, if it be found that the matrimonial relation exists, then for the purpose of a dissolution of that relation.—Estate of Lee, 310.

2. JUDGMENT IN REM—EFFECT OF.—As a judgment of divorce is in rem, it is binding upon all the world as to the determination of the marital status of the parties and is immune from collateral attack, except on grounds specified by the code.—Id.

3. DETERMINATION OF MARITAL STATUS—JUDGMENT—PRESUMPTION OF LEGITIMACY OF CHILD.—A judgment of divorce is a conclusive determination of the status of the parties to the action as husband and wife from the date of the marriage to the dissolution of that relation by a judgment of divorce, and a child born to the parties during said time is entitled to the presumption of legitimacy declared by section 193 of the Civil Code, and no one except the class enumerated in section 195 of the Civil Code is entitled to dispute the legitimacy of such child.—Id.

4. APPEAL—FAILURE TO PAY COUNSEL FEES—STAY.—In an action for divorce, a motion to stay appellant's appeal until he shall have obeyed orders of the trial court for the payment of counsel fees of respondent should be denied where there is no showing either that appellant is able to comply with the orders or that respondent is unable to provide herself with and to pay counsel to represent her upon said appeal.—Pugliese v. Pugliese, 652.

5. SUPPORT OF MINOR CHILD—LIEN—CONSTRUCTION OF DECREE.—In an action of divorce, where the court ordered a deed of trust owned by the defendant (which the latter had deposited with a bank and had given an order to the bank to pay the amounts falling due thereon to the minor child of the parties) to be held for security for the payment of certain amounts provided in the ELECTIONS. 841

## DIVORCE (Continued).

interlocutory decree to be paid to the wife for the support of said child, the order created a lien on the indebtedness secured by the trust deed; and where it appears that the full amount unpaid under said trust deed will be necessary for a compliance with said order during the minority of said child, the lien takes priority over a subsequent order of the probate court setting aside the property to the widow of the deceased under section 1469 of the Code of Civil Procedure.—Estate of Smith, 654.

6. SECURITY FOR PAYMENT OF SUPPORT—SECTION 140, CIVIL CODE—POWER OF COURT.—Under section 140 of the Civil Code the court has power in an action for divorce to require the husband to give reasonable security for the payment of money ordered by the court.—Id.

7. ORDER FOR SUPPORT OF MINOR CHILD—CONTINUANCE AFTER DEATH OF PARENT.—Where the court in an action for divorce orders the husband to pay a certain amount to the wife for support of their minor child during minority, and imposes a lien upon the property of the husband as security for the payment, the order remains in force after the death of the husband during the minority of the child or until the order is modified by the court.—Id.

8. ORDER SETTING ASIDE WHOLE ESTATE TO WIDOW—JURISDICTION.—An order in probate setting aside all the property of the estate of a decedent to the widow cannot be construed as an order modifying an interlocutory decree of divorce against the decedent which ordered payment by the latter to his wife of a certain amount for the support of their minor child and imposed a lien upon certain property as security for such payment, as the probate court has no jurisdiction over divorce court proceedings and is without power to modify any order or decree rendered in the divorce action.—Id.

8a. CUSTODY OF MINOR CHILDREN—MODIFICATION OF FINAL DECREE—DISCRETION OF COURT.—Under section 138 of the Civil Code, the trial court has power to modify a final decree of divorce so as to give the custody of minor children to one of the parties at specified intervals of time, and an application for such modification is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court, the exercise of which discretion will not be disturbed on appeal unless a clear case of abuse is shown; and the court is not required to award the custody of the children in conformity with an agreement of the parties as to the disposition to be made of said children, which agreement was made prior to the divorce and while the parties were separated.—Van der Vliet v.

ESTATES OF DECEASED PERSONS.

1. EXECUTORS, ADMINISTRATORS, AND TESTAMENTARY TRUSTEES—EMPLOYMENT OF ATTORNEY—COMPENSATION.—An executor, administrator, or testamentary trustee who is himself an attorney may properly employ another attorney to render the necessary legal services for the estate, and he may be entitled to an allowance out of the estate for the value of such legal services; but if the executor, administrator, or testamentary trustee, being himself a practicing attorney, elects to act as his own attorney in the performance of the legal services incident to the administration of the estate, the general rule is that he will not be entitled to an allowance against the estate for his professional services, in the absence of some statutory provision entitling him thereto.—Estate of Parker, 132.

2. ATTORNEY AS EXECUTOR—EMPLOYMENT OF OWN FIRM—RULE.—An executor or administrator who is himself a lawyer may be allowed a credit for fees to be paid a law firm of which he is a member, if it was agreed between him and his partners that he was not to share in the moneys to be received by the firm for its services; but if he was to participate in the compensation to be earned by his firm, the same principles and policies which are opposed to the allowance of additional compensation to an executor or administrator for legal services rendered by him individually as an attorney at law are equally opposed to an allowance of compensation to his law firm.—Id.

3. ABSENCE OF AGREEMENT—PRESUMPTIONS.—In the absence from the record of any express agreement between an attorney acting as executor of an estate and his law partners acting as attorneys for the executor as to whether the executor was or was not to participate in the compensation to be received by his firm for its legal services, the presumption is that the executor was to share the compensation with his partners, and, under such circumstances, an order allowing such firm of lawyers compensation for extra legal services is erroneous.—Id. ESTATES OF DECEASED PERSONS. 843

## ESTATES OF DECEASED PERSONS (Continued).

4. **SECTION 1618, CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE.**—The amendment of 1925 to section 1618 of the Code of Civil Procedure removing the limit upon the amount which may be allowed an executor or administrator as additional compensation for an extraordinary service performed by him cannot be relied upon to sustain an order for such compensation made prior to said amendment, as this would give the amendment a retroactive effect.—Id.

5. **CHARACTER OF SERVICES.**—The study by an executor and his counsel of the stock market in order to be able to make an advantageous sale of shares of stock belonging to the estate is not a professional service for which a lawyer may make a charge payable out of the estate, but is the performance of the ordinary duty of the executor in selling the property of his testator.—Id.

6. **WILLS—APPOINTMENT OF ADMINISTRATORS WITH WILL ANNEXED—CONSTRUCTION OF WILL.**—Where a testator appointed his widow as sole executrix of his will but provided that if he and his wife should be called by death at the same time other named parties should be appointed as executors, the death of the widow three days after her husband's death, from a cause in no way connected therewith, defeated the right of the parties conditionally appointed as executors.—Estate of Kimball, 247.

7. **APPOINTMENT OF ADMINISTRATORS—POWER OF COURT.**—In such a case, where the widow's survival of the testator defeated the right of those named conditionally to act as executors, the court had the power, under section 1426 of the Code of Civil Procedure, after the death of the widow, to appoint qualified persons nominated by the widow, as administratrices with the will annexed, entirely regardless of the validity or invalidity of such nomination.—Id.

8. **CONTOVERSY BETWEEN LEGATEES—PARTY AGGRIEVED—APPEAL BY EXECUTORS—DISMISSAL.**—Where a controversy in the estate of a deceased person is entirely between the different legatees under the last will of the deceased, the executor having no interest therein is not a party aggrieved by a decree of distribution determining the rights of the several legatees and an appeal by the executors from the decree will, therefore, be dismissed.—Estate of Babb, 252.

9. **BEQUESTS OF MONEY IN BANK—BEQUEST OF INTEREST IN ESTATE—CONSTRUCTION OF WILL.**—Where a testator bequeaths all money that he may have in any bank at the time of his death to a certain person, and by a later paragraph of his will bequeaths and devises all of his right, title, and interest in the estate of a decedent to which he was one of the heirs at law, the legatee of the money in bank is entitled to all moneys in bank at the time of the death of testator, from whatever source coming, including moneys received by the latter before his death from the estate of which he was an heir.—Id. 844
ESTATES OF DECEASED PERSONS.

## ESTATES OF DECEASED PERSONS (Continued).

10. **CONSTRUCTION OF WILL—TIME.**—A will speaks from the date of the death of the testator and not from the date of its execution. Id.

11. **RECEIPT OF MONEY—ADEMPTION OF LEGACIES.**—The receipt by the testator of the money and property from the estate of which he was an heir, in such case, produced an ademption of the legacies to the parties to whom he had bequeathed and devised his interest in said estate, in so far as the money and property so received by the testator might have been included in said legacies had said money and property remained a part of the said estate up to and including the date of the testator's death.—Id.

12. **PROCEEDS FROM SALE OF STOCK—RESIDUARY LEGACY.**—In such a case, where the testator received during his lifetime stock from the estate of which he was an heir, which stock was a part of his estate at the time of his death, the residuum of the proceeds of sale of the stock passed to the residuary legatee instead of to the specific legatees of the interest of the decedent in the estate from which said stock came.—Id.

13. **PAYMENT OF EXPENSES—RESIDUARY LEGACY.**—In such a case, it was error for the court to make a proportionate deduction of the debts, funeral expenses, and the expenses of administration from the specific legacies, and said debts and expenses should have been deducted from the residuum of the estate before any distribution to the residuary legatee.—Id.

14. **WILL CONTEST—HOLOGRAPHIC WILL—EXECUTION—TESTAMENTARY CAPACITY.**—In a contest of an instrument, alleged to be the holographic will of a deceased person, based upon a claim that the instrument was not entirely dated, written, and signed by the hand of the decedent, and that the latter was not of sound mind at the time of its execution, where the evidence is conflicting upon the issues, a verdict in favor of the contestant will not be disturbed on appeal.—Estate of Johnson, 299.

15. **LACK OF TESTAMENTARY CAPACITY—PRESUMPTIONS.**—Where an old person was declared by a decree of the superior court incompetent to manage her property or to care for her person, and a guardian of her person and estate was appointed, and thereafter by decree of said court she was adjudged an insane person and committed to the state hospital, such facts, together with the testimony of a witness that her mental condition was absolutely the same during a period covering the dates of said adjudications, which included the date of execution of her alleged will, raised a presumption of lack of testamentary capacity in executing the will.—Id.

16. **EVIDENCE—CORROBORATION.**—The fact that much of the testimony of the contestant in a will contest is uncorroborated does not for that reason remove it from the consideration of the jury.—Id. ESTATES OF DECEASED PERSONS. 845
ESTATES OF DECEASED PERSONS (Continued).

17. INSTRUCTIONS—CONSTRUCTION OF.—In such a case where the court gave an instruction that, "The jury has the proposed will before it as well as the exemplars of the handwriting of Aurilla Johnson, and it is for you to determine therefrom whether or not this document is wholly written, dated and signed in the handwriting of the decedent. You may determine this issue even contrary to the opinion of an expert, or without the evidence of a handwriting expert," the contention that the use of the word "therefrom" withdrew from the consideration of the jury oral testimony relating to the genuineness of the document in question, and limited the jury's consideration of the evidence to the proposed will and exemplars, cannot be maintained, where the court further instructed the jury that the instructions must be considered by it as a whole and that the proposed will might be considered together with all the evidence in the case.—Id.

18. USURPATION OF FUNCTION OF JURY—EXPERT TESTIMONY.—The contention in such case that in said instruction the court usurped the function of the jury in stating that the issue might be determined "contrary to the opinion of an expert, or without the opinion of a handwriting expert," cannot be maintained, where no handwriting expert was called, as it may be assumed that the court meant testimony of such an expert was not necessary, which is a correct statement of the law.—Id.

19. HANDWRITING—DETERMINATION OF—COMPARISON OF DOCUMENTS.—In such a case, an instruction that the jury could determine the issue with reference to the handwriting of the decedent by the comparison of the documents and without the aid of the oral testimony of any witness is a correct statement of the law.—Id.

20. PROOF OF INCOMPETENCY—GUARDIANSHIP—TESTAMENTARY CAPACITY—BURDEN OF PROOF.—Proof of incompetency in a guardianship proceeding is evidence of mental condition on the date of the adjudication, but it is not *prima facie* evidence of testamentary incapacity so as to shift the burden of proof to the proponent of a will of the ward.—Id.

21. ADOPTED CHILD—CONSIDERATION OF FACT—INSTRUCTIONS.—An adopted child is the lawful child of the decedent the same as though born in lawful wedlock, and in a contest by such child of the will of her adopted mother there is no error in instructing the jury that in considering the evidence it should bear in mind the legal effect of the adoption proceedings.—Id.

22. EVIDENCE—PHYSICIAN AND PATIENT—PRIVILEGED COMMUNICATIONS.—A conversation between a doctor, who is medical superintendent of a state hospital for the insane, and an inmate thereof, for the purpose of ascertaining particularly the mental condition of the patient, is privileged and inadmissible in evidence in a contest of the will of the patient.—Id. 846
ESTATES OF DECEASED PERSONS.

## ESTATES OF DECEASED PERSONS (Continued).

23. **IMPROPER QUESTION**—LACK OF PREJUDICE.—In a will contest, where on cross-examination the contestant's counsel asked the sole beneficiary under the will the question, "Then you do not propose to be bound by the action of this jury in the event that they find that she was of unsound mind on April 3, 1923, do you?" to which objection was sustained, the failure to direct the jury to pay no heed to the question was not prejudicial error, where the court in other instructions specifically directed the jury to banish from their minds all questions propounded by counsel to which objections had been sustained.—Id.

24. **HEIRSHIP**—LEGITIMACY OF CHILD—EVIDENCE.—Upon a petition for distribution of the estate of a deceased person to a child born after a marriage ceremony between the decedent, a mulatto, and a white woman, evidence of the legitimacy of the child, offered on the theory that the marriage of said parties was void, is inadmissible, where the child was born during the period between the date of such marriage and its dissolution by a decree of divorce, as such child was, after the divorce, presumed to be legitimate, which presumption can be disputed only by the persons named in section 195 of the Civil Code.—Estate of Lee, 310.

25. **TESTAMENTARY DISPOSITION TO "HEIRS"**—CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION 1334, CIVIL CODE—APPLICATION OF SECTION 1386, CIVIL CODE.—Section 1334 of the Civil Code, where said section legitimately applies, makes section 1386 of the Civil Code applicable, not only for the designation and description of the takers, but also for the purpose of fixing the proportions in which each shall take.—Dickey v. Walrond, 335.

26. **DEFINITION OF "HEIRS."**—The "heirs" of a person are those whom the law appoints to succeed to his estate in case he dies without disposing of it by will.—Id.

27. **SECTION 1386, CIVIL CODE**—DESIGNATION OF HEIRS.—Section 1386 of the Civil Code is the source in every case for a designation of the persons to meet the description of heirs.—Id.

28. **CONSTRUCTION OF WILL**—WORDS OF DONATION.—Where a will provides, after making certain specific bequests, that the balance of the property shall pass to trustees to be held until two minor sons of the decedent shall reach the age of twenty-one years, and thereupon the estate in fee shall pass in an undivided one-half to the wife of the decedent and an undivided one-fourth to each son, qualified, however, by the provision that in the event of the death of the wife during the life of the trust, the undivided one-half part that would otherwise have gone to her shall go to her "heirs at law," the words "heirs at law," as used in the will, are to be construed as words of donation and not of limitation; and upon the death of the wife before the termination of the trust the property vests in ESTATES OF DECEASED PERSONS. 847
ESTATES OF DECEASED PERSONS (Continued).

the heirs of the wife *per stirpes*, and not *per capita*, under section 1386 of the Civil Code.—Id.

29. ESTATE OF WIFE.—Under such a will, the widow of the decedent was not vested with a life estate, with the remainder over to her heirs at law, but at most merely an equitable one during the life of the trust and perhaps for such less time as she might live.—Id.

30. NATURE OF ESTATE—RULE IN SHELLEY'S CASE.—The fact that the widow had an equitable estate during the life of the trust, in such a case, cannot be held to support a legal estate in remainder predicated thereon, such as would have come under the rule in Shelley's Case.—Id.

31. WILLS—OPPOSITION TO PROBATE OF—MINOR HEIRS—NOTICE.—Minor children who are legatees under a will and residents of the county in which a petition for its probate is filed should be served with copies of written grounds of opposition to the probate of the will, under the provisions of section 1312 of the Code of Civil Procedure.—Estate of Thompson, 410.

32. UNDUE INFLUENCE—CONFIDENTIAL RELATIONS—RULE.—A confidential relationship and opportunity to influence a testator are not sufficient to overthrow a will, but there must be proof of the exercise of that influence to actually overthrow the mind and will of the testator at the moment of executing the will.—Id.

33. EXECUTION OF WILL—PARTICIPATION OF LEGATEE.—The reply, "All right," of a legatee, made to the testator's statement that he intended to make a change in his will, is no evidence of participation of the legatee in the making of the will.—Id.

34. NATURALNESS OF WILL.—A will is not unnatural in making a modest provision for the support of a woman who had worked for the testator for a number of years in accumulating his property, without salary, and to whom he was to be married, where the testator had no one depending upon him, his mother being aged and having sufficient for her support, and he having left the bulk of his estate to minor children of his brother and sister.—Id.

35. WILL CONTEST—EVIDENCE.—In a will contest, the jury is not at liberty to decide, without evidence, that a legatee has not narrated all of a conversation about the will and that more was said upon the subject; nor has it the right to infer from the fact that the decedent gave a diamond ring to said legatee she importuned the gift and that if she importuned the gift she also importuned the execution of the will.—Id.

36. EXISTENCE OF WILL—DECLARATIONS OF DECEDENT—ADMISSIBILITY OF.—In a will contest, declarations of the testator, offered for the purpose of showing that he made the will, are admissible.—Id.

37. HOLOGRAPHIC WILLS—CONFLICT OF LAWS—WITNESSES.—Although a holographic codicil to a will may be invalid under the laws of 848
ESTATES OF DECEASED PERSONS.

## ESTATES OF DECEASED PERSONS (Continued).

the state where the testator was domiciled, by reason of the absence of witnesses to it, when offered for probate in this state its sufficiency is governed by the law here, which does not require witnesses to such document.—Estate of Gracey, 482.

38. **PROBATE PROCEDURE—FOREIGN TESTATOR—PROPERTY IN THIS STATE.** Where a testator was domiciled out of the state and his estate is being probated in the place of his domicile, if his interest in the estate of another, consisting partly of real property being probated in this state, be determined, by the doctrine of equitable conversion, to be personal property, it should be delivered to his executor for distribution in accordance with the law of his domicile; but if it be determined that there is no equitable conversion, the property should be distributed under the laws of this state.—Id.

39. **EQUITABLE CONVERSION—INTENTION—SECTION 1338, CIVIL CODE.**—Whether an equitable conversion of real property into personal property is effected by the will of a deceased person depends upon the intent of the testator, as shown by the provisions of the will; and where there is no express direction, or intention so shown therefor, such conversion does not result, even though the executor is given a discretionary power to sell all or any of the real estate. Id.

40. **CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION 1338, CIVIL CODE.**—Section 1338 of the Civil Code, providing that when a will directs the conversion of real property into money, such property and all its proceeds must be deemed personal property from the time of the testator's death, is simply declaratory of the common law; and the doctrine rests on the principle that equity considers that as done which ought to have been done.—Id.

41. **CONSTRUCTION OF WILL—VESTING OF PROPERTY.**—A provision of a will that "After the funeral expenses and bequests are paid, should there still remain any money or property of whatsoever nature I die possessed of, I give to" a named person, vests the title to real property of the estate in the person named at the moment of the death of the decedent.—Id.

42. **REAL ESTATE—SALE OF—CHARACTER OF PROCEEDS.**—When it becomes necessary to sell a portion of the real property of a decedent to pay specific bequests, and the whole of such property is sold, the surplus beyond the amount required for the purposes mentioned retains its character as real estate for purposes of distribution.—Id.

43. **DOCTRINE OF EQUITABLE CONVERSION—PURPOSE.**—The doctrine of equitable conversion is a device employed in equity to bring about equitable results, and it is invoked to accomplish the intention of the testator, and for the benefit of beneficiaries.—Id.

44. **CONSTRUCTION OF WILL.**—A provision in a holographic codicil to the will of a deceased person that, "of all money or moneys derived from the sale of real estate to come to me from the estate of" a ESTATES OF DECEASED PERSONS. 849
ESTATES OF DECEASED PERSONS (Continued).

named decedent, "that is of all the net amount that may come to me from said estate, I bequeath" to certain named institutions, does not show an intent of the testator to accomplish an equitable conversion of the real property of the estate.—Id.

45. USE OF WORD "BEQUEATH" INSTEAD OF "DEVISE."—The use of the word "bequeath" instead of "devise" in such codicil was sufficient to pass title to the real property where it appears that the codicil was holographic and that the testator was unacquainted with the technical meaning of the term "bequeath," and intended by its use that it should apply to the takers of real property as well as personal property.—Id.

46. APPEAL ON JUDGMENT-ROLL ALONE—INTENDMENTS.—Where an appeal is on the judgment-roll alone and the evidence is not before the appellate court, all intendments are in favor of the determinations of the trial court.—Id.

47. CONSTRUCTION OF WILL.—A will should be so interpreted as to render it operative, if it be reasonably susceptible to such interpretation, to the end that the intention of the testator be given effect and that intestacy be avoided.—Id.

48. BEQUEST TO CHARITIES—AMOUNT—VALUE OF ESTATE.—In fixing the amount of one-third of the estate of a decedent which may be distributed to charitable uses under section 1313 of the Civil Code, the aggregate estate, wherever situated, is to be taken into consideration; and where the evidence is not before the court on appeal, it will be assumed that the trial court in determining such question had sufficient competent evidence before it upon which to base its implied finding to the effect that the administration of the estate of the decedent in a foreign state had progressed to the point where no further costs of administration would accrue.—Id.

49. APPEAL FROM DECREE OF DISTRIBUTION—SUFFICIENCY OF NOTICE.—Although the language in a notice of appeal from a decree of distribution in the estate of a deceased person is confusing, where it correctly designates the date of the decree and the date of its entry and an amendment thereto, no other decree being entered in the matter, the notice sufficiently identifies the decree and is sufficient.—Estate of O'Connor, 646.

50. FINAL ACCOUNT—EVIDENCE.—Upon the settlement of a final account in the estate of a deceased person, it is error to allow an item which exceeds twenty dollars where there is no voucher to support the item and there is no basis of the approval of the item except an unverified statement of counsel.—Id.

51. PAYMENT OF TAXES AND ASSESSMENTS.—Taxes and street assessments which are past due liens upon the property of the estate of a deceased person in course of administration are properly payable by the executor in the care and management of the estate;

200 Cal.—54 850
ESTATES OF DECEASED PERSONS.

## ESTATES OF DECEASED PERSONS (Continued).

and the fact that such taxes and assessments are upon land devised to the executor should not deprive him of the right.—Id.

52. EXECUTOR AND ATTORNEY—ALLOWANCE FOR LOSS.—The executor of the estate of a deceased person should be given credit in his final account for a loss shown upon re-appraisement of the property, but this item should not be included in the aggregate upon which the compensation of himself and his attorney is computed.—Id.

53. POSSESSION OF ESTATE—PRESUMPTION—WAGES FOR COMPENSATION.—The statute requires the executor of the estate of a deceased person to take into possession all of the estate of the testator, both real and personal, and in the absence of a showing to the contrary, it will be presumed that the executor has complied with the statutory requirements and compensation should be allowed both the executor and his attorney based upon such property, as shown by the inventory and appraisement.—Id.

54. DISTRIBUTION—GAS AND OIL RIGHTS.—Where a codicil to a will devises a certain percentage of gas and oil rights to certain devisees, objection to their distribution upon the ground that all hope or expectation of oil or gas production from said property has been abandoned and such distribution will constitute a cloud upon the title is untenable.—Id.

55. COMPENSATION OF EXECUTOR AND ATTORNEY—EXTRAORDINARY SERVICES—DISCRETION.—Under sections 1618 and 1619 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the probate court has the discretion to allow compensation to the executor and his attorney for extraordinary services in securing a loan with which to pay debts of the estate.—Id.

56. WILL CONTEST—MOTION FOR NONSUIT—CONSIDERATION OF EVIDENCE.—Upon a will contest all of the evidence in favor of the contestants must, as against a motion for a nonsuit, be taken as true, and contradictory evidence, if any, must be disregarded; and this having been done, if there is any substantial evidence tending to prove the facts necessary to make out the contestant's case, the motion for a nonsuit must be denied and the case given to the jury.—Estate of Hinde, 710.

57. CONFIDENTIAL RELATIONS—UNDUE INFLUENCE—FRAUD—INSUFFICIENCY OF EVIDENCE.—In this will contest it is held that the record fails to disclose any evidence tending to show or establish that a confidential relationship existed between the decedent and the respondent and likewise fails to reveal any evidence which would give credence to the allegations and assertions of undue influence and fraud.—Id.

58. WILLS—RIGHT TO MAKE UNJUST OR UNNATURAL WILL.—A testator has the right to make an unjust, or an unreasonable, or even a ESTATES OF DECEASED PERSONS. 851
ESTATES OF DECEASED PERSONS (Continued).

cruel will, and no will may be legally set aside on the mere establishment that it is such a will.—Id.

59. UNDUE INFLUENCE—PROOF.—In order to set aside a will upon the ground of undue influence it must be shown that pressure was brought to bear upon the testator which overpowered his mind and overcame his volition at the very time the will was made and that the will was not the expression of his own desires. Id.

60. INTEREST AND OPPORTUNITY—PRESUMPTION.—The presumption of undue influence is not raised by proof of interest and opportunity alone.—Id.

61. TESTAMENTARY TRUSTS—CONSTRUCTION—STATUS OF PARTIES.—Where a trust created by will provided that the daughter of the decedent was to receive as beneficiary a certain share of the net income to be derived from the operation of the trust property but that upon her death her allotted share of the principal of the estate "should be transferred and distributed as she may by will direct," the death of the daughter terminated her relationship under the trust and worked an immediate elimination of her allotted share in the principal of the estate from the control of the trust and transferred the same to her devisee; and her devisee became a tenant in common of the property with the trustee.—Meyer v. Superior Court, 776.

62. DEATH OF TRUSTEE—RIGHTS OF DEVISEE.—In such a case, upon the death of the daughter of the decedent, who was a trustee under his will, all the rights and interests which she had in the trust property by reason of being such trustee came to an end and did not descend to her devisee.—Id.

63. INTEREST OF WIDOW—SUCCESSION TO DAUGHTER—STATUS OF.—Where the decedent in such a case transferred the bulk of his property to trustees for certain purposes, but the widow claimed and received her community interest in the property instead of taking under the trust, the widow thereby became a tenant in common with the trustees of the property, as did the daughter as to the part of the property which she took as an heir of her mother.—Id.

64. CONSTRUCTION OF WILL—CONTINGENT REMAINDERS.—From a construction of the will in this case it is held that, under the trust therein created, the right and interest of a daughter of the decedent, to which she, as one of the heirs, would succeed in the event of one or more of her coheirs dying without issue or without making such testamentary disposition as they were entitled to make under the will, were contingent remainders existing at the time of said daughter's death and to which her sole devisee would be entitled under her will; and that such contingent remainders would 852
ESTATES OF DECEASED PERSONS.

**ESTATES OF DECEASED PERSONS (Continued).**

be defeated by the death of certain coheirs leaving issue and by the making of testamentary disposition by others.—Id.

65. **RIPENING OF ESTATE—RELATION OF PARTIES.**—In such a case, if the interests of the daughter of the decedent represented by the contingent remainders had ripened, during her lifetime, through the death of any one or more of her coheirs under circumstances which would have called such contingent remainders into being, she would not have, as to these rights, become a *costui quo trust* under the trust estate, but only a tenant in common as to such remainders with the trust estate, and her sole devisee could not in the nature of things become vested with any greater or different interests.—Id.

66. **TRUST ESTATE—TENANT IN COMMON—VACANCY IN TRUSTEESHIP—RIGHT OF TENANT IN COMMON.**—A tenant in common of property, the remaining undivided interest in which is held in a trust estate, the trusteeship of which has become vacant, is not entitled of right to participate in proceedings in the superior court having jurisdiction over such trust instituted for the purpose of filling such vacancy, or to receive notice of such proceedings before such court or the judge thereof can acquire jurisdiction to proceed to fill such vacant trusteeship.—Id.

67. **TENANTS IN COMMON—NATURE OF TITLE.**—The only unity of tenants in common in the property held by them as such by several and distinct titles is that of possession.—Id.

68. **VACANCY IN TRUSTEESHIP—APPOINTMENT—RIGHT IN TENANT IN COMMON AND REMAINDERMEN.**—In such a case, the widower of the daughter of the decedent secondly mentioned in his will, who was her sole devisee, occupies no such relation to the trust or to the trust property as would entitle him, either as tenant in common or as successor to his wife in the contingent remainders provided by the trust, to maintain, as a matter of right, an action or proceeding instituted by him as plaintiff against the beneficiaries of the trust for the appointment of a successor to the vacant trusteeship therein; nor is he entitled to receive notice of proceedings instituted by the beneficiaries among themselves for the appointment of a trustee to such vacant trusteeship, such notice to him not being a prerequisite to the jurisdiction of the Superior Court to make such appointment.—Id.

69. **MORTGAGE—APPOINTMENT OF TRUSTEE.**—A corporation holding mortgages on trust property to secure indebtedness created under order of court by the trustee is neither entitled to notice of a proceeding for the appointment of a trustee nor to be consulted in such appointment.—Id.

70. **APPOINTMENT OF RECEIVERS.**—There is no provision in the statutes relating to the appointment of receivers which imposes a juris- EVIDENCE. 853

## ESTATES OF DECEASED PERSONS (Continued).

dictional requirement that other parties than the necessary and proper parties to the action or proceeding in question must be brought in as parties thereto or must receive notice of the application for the appointment of the receiver.—Id.

See Trusts, 1, 8; Wills, 1, 4, 7, 12, 17, 18.

## ESTOPPEL.

1. **CONTRACTS—GUARANTY—INSUFFICIENCY OF EVIDENCE.**—In this action to recover a certain sum on a contract of guaranty it is held that the evidence does not warrant the finding that the defendant is estopped by reason of his conduct with respect to the several transactions involved from denying his liability upon a contract sued upon.—General Motors Accept. Corp. v. Gandy, 284.

2. **EQUITABLE ESTOPPEL—BURDEN OF PROOF.**—The existence of an estoppel is a question of fact, and the settled rule as to the proof of equitable estoppel is that the burden rests upon the party asserting such estoppel to prove all the elements constituting it by evidence having some reasonable tendency to establish the fact.—Id.

3. **ELEMENTS OF ESTOPPEL—FALSE REPRESENTATIONS—CONCEALMENT.** Among the dominant essentials of equitable estoppel or estoppel *in pais* is there must have been a false representation or a concealment of material facts of the matter as to which the estoppel is claimed, and the party to whom such representation was made or from whom such facts were concealed must have been ignorant, actually and permissibly, of the truth of the matter.—Id.

4. **PROOF—CHARACTER OF.**—As an equitable estoppel must be proved, as a rule, by oral testimony, the rule that certainty is essential to all estoppels is peculiarly applicable to estoppels *in pais*, and it must be established so as to leave nothing to surmise or questionable inference; and the representations, whether express or implied from the conduct of the party against whom the estoppel is sought to be invoked, must be such as to justify a prudent man in acting upon them, and must be plain and not doubtful.—Id.

5. **SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS.**—It is held in this action that the record presents no question involving the heirs, administrators, successors, or assigns of the respective parties to the contract of guaranty.—Id.

See Reclamation Districts, 15; Waters and Water Rights, 17.

## EVIDENCE.

**CONSTRUCTION OF WRITTEN INSTRUMENT.**—Under section 1860 of the Code of Civil Procedure and section 1647 of the Civil Code, for the purpose of construing an instrument, the circumstances under which it is made may be shown, but these sections apply only 854

FIRE INSURANCE.

1. CONSTRUCTION OF POLICIES — AMBIGUITY — EVIDENCE. — In actions upon fire insurance policies, in which the terms of the covering clauses are ambiguous, interpretation of such clauses may be aided by the circumstances attending the issuance of the policies.—Siskin v. Alliance Ins. Co., 70.

2. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.—Where the agents who conducted the preliminary interviews with the insured were the agents of the insurers, and not of the insured, the terms of the covering clauses in the policies, which are ambiguous, are to be construed liberally in favor of the insured and strictly against the insurer, by reason of the fact that whatever ambiguity or uncertainty exists therein was caused by the insurer.—Id.

3. COVERING CLAUSE—PROPERTY COVERED.—By the use of the word "rear" or of the clause "in the rear" in fire insurance policies, in describing merchandise and materials in a building, it must be held that it was the intention of the framers of the policies to refer merely to the location of the property to be covered by the insurance at the date of the issuance of the policies, and by the use of the terms "additions adjoining and communicating," it was intended that the coverage clauses should apply to such stock FISH AND GAME. 855
**FIRE INSURANCE (Continued).**

of merchandise wherever situated in the insured's plant in the course of its progressive movement therein during the processes of manufacture.—Id.

4. **CONSTRUCTION OF POLICY.**—Where an insured had for several years carried blanket insurance on the stock of merchandise in his manufacturing plant, and, in interviews held prior to the issuance of new policies, had been informed by the insurers' representatives, who were familiar with his place of business and manufacturing activities, that the board of fire underwriters had notified the insurers not to issue policies of insurance in blanket form unless the insured would accept the insertion of a ninety per cent co-insurance clause in the policy, which the insured refused to consent to, and the new policies were written with blanket insurance and no requirement of co-insurance, the policies must be interpreted to cover the insured's stock wherever the same was to be placed in the "additions adjoining and communicating" with the plant during the course of manufacture.—Id.

**FISH AND GAME.**

1. **REGULATION OF SHIPPING OF CRABS—SECTION 626, PENAL CODE—CONSTITUTIONAL LAW—CRIMINAL LAW.**—Section 626 of the Penal Code is not unconstitutional in permitting the shipment of crabs from one to other districts into which the state has been divided by said section, but prohibiting such shipment into the territory of the state outside said districts.—In re Makings, 474.

2. **SECTION 25½, ARTICLE IV, CONSTITUTION—PURPOSE OF.**—The purpose of section 25½ of article IV of the constitution, providing that the legislature may divide the state into fish and game districts and enact such laws for the protection of fish and game therein as it may deem appropriate to the respective districts, was to remove the former restriction of article IV, section 25, subdivision 33, which prohibited the enactment of a local law where a general law could be made applicable; and it in nowise limits the sovereign power of the state over fish and game, or the legislature to legislate concerning the same, but, on the contrary, it increases the legislative discretion by authorizing local laws on the subject. Id.

3. **DIVISION OF STATE INTO DISTRICTS—REGULATION OF CERTAIN DISTRICTS—POWER OF LEGISLATURE.**—There is nothing in the language of section 25½ of article IV of the constitution to indicate that the legislature is not given power to make regulations applicable to two or more districts into which it is authorized by said section to divide the state, without making the same applicable to the state generally.—Id.

4. **REMEDIAL LEGISLATION—STATUTORY CONSTRUCTION.**—Section 25½ of article IV of the constitution is remedial in character and should 856 FISH AND GAME COMMISSION.

FISH AND GAME (Continued).

be given a liberal construction; and in construing the section the court should consider the subject matter with which it deals in its endeavor to ascertain the true meaning of the language used.—Id.

5. PURPOSE OF CONSTITUTION.—It was the purpose of the amendment of the constitution by the adoption of section 25½ of article IV to take from local authorities the right to regulate the fish and game of the state and to invest such power exclusively in the legislature, and it was designed to clothe the legislature with ample power to adequately protect the fish and game of the state. Id.

6. PURPOSE OF LEGISLATION—PROTECTION AND USE OF FISH AND GAME. One of the purposes determining the legislature in the enactment of laws with reference to the fish and game of the state is to permit the largest use of fish and game compatible with the reasonable protection thereof.—Id.

See Fish and Game Commission, 1; Judicial Notice, 1.

FISH AND GAME COMMISSION.

JURISDICTION—REGULATION OF FISH AND GAME—ADMINISTRATIVE POWER—JUDICIAL DEPARTMENT.—The granting of power to the Fish and Game Commission of California to hold hearings and determine facts incidental to the regulation of fish and game, and to the granting of permits to take and use fish, is valid as an administrative or regulatory power, and in nowise transgresses upon the exclusive functions of the judicial department.—Globe Cotton Oil Mills v.

IRRIGATION DISTRICTS.

1. IRRIGATION DISTRICTS—NAME OF MUNICIPAL CORPORATIONS.—An irrigation district is not strictly a municipal corporation but a public corporation for municipal purposes.—Crawford v. Imperial Irr. Dist., 318.

2. POWERS OF IRRIGATION DISTRICTS.—An irrigation district, like any other public or private corporation, derives its powers from the statute under which it is created and from such other statutes as may have been enacted by the legislature granting it additional powers or limiting those already granted; and these powers are as different from those exercised by a strictly municipal corporation 858

## JUDGES.

See Courts, 3, 10, 14.

## JUDGMENTS.

1. **DEFAULT—SETTING ASIDE—DISCRETION—APPEAL.**—A motion to set aside a default judgment is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court and in the absence of a clear showing of abuse in the exercise thereof an appellate court will not disturb the order of the court below.—Waybright v. Anderson, 374.

2. **HEARING ON MERITS.**—It is the policy of the law to favor, wherever possible, a hearing on the merits, and appellate courts are much more disposed to affirm an order when the result is to compel a trial upon the merits than it is when a judgment by default is allowed to stand and it appears that a substantial defense could be made.—Id.

3. **SECTION 473, CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE—CONSTRUCTION.**—Section 473 of the Code of Civil Procedure is a remedial provision and is to be liberally construed so as to dispose of cases upon their substantial merits, and to give to the party claiming in good faith to have a subsisting cause of action or a substantial defense thereto an opportunity to present it; and it is for this reason that appellate courts more readily listen to an appeal from an order refusing to set aside default than where the motion has been granted, since in such a case the defaulting party may be deprived of a substantial right.—Id.

4. **MOTION TO SET ASIDE DEFAULT—CONFLICTING AFFIDAVITS—APPEAL.** Upon motions to set aside defaults in filing amended complaints, where the affidavit of counsel for the moving parties alleged that the affiant understood that by a telephone agreement with opposing counsel the date within which amended complaints might be served and filed was left open and that affiant believed judgments of default or dismissal would not be entered in the *interim*, which belief was reasonable under the circumstances, although counter-affidavits controverted these facts, the decision of the trial court setting aside the defaults is conclusive on appeal.—Id.

5. **ORAL STIPULATIONS—EXCEPTION TO RULE.**—While the general rule is that a stipulation of counsel cannot be enforced unless put in writing, or entered in the minutes of the court, the courts have been indisposed to give this otherwise general rule application to default judgments.—Id.

6. **AFFIDAVIT OF MERITS — VERIFIED COMPLAINT.**—Upon a motion to vacate a default entered upon failure to file an amended com- JURY TRIALS. 859

APPLICATION TO SET ASIDE DEFAULT—TIME.—Where counsel, twenty-eight days after obtaining knowledge of the entry of defaults, served and filed notices of motion to vacate defaults entered upon failure to file verified complaints within time, and made application in open court twelve days thereafter, the application was made within time under section 473 of the Code of Civil Procedure.—Id.

8. DEFAULT—MOTION TO VACATE—TIME—SECTION 473, CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE.—Under section 473 of the Code of Civil Procedure, a motion to vacate a default on the grounds therein enumerated must be made within a "reasonable time," not exceeding six months; and the clerk's entry of the default, and not the entry of the judgment by the court, fixes the beginning of the six months within which the application must be made.—Hunt, Mirk & Co. v. Hesperides Min. Co., 382.

JUDICIAL NOTICE.

BOUNDARIES OF STATE—FISHERIES—PROHIBITION.—In a proceeding for a writ of prohibition to restrain the superior court from further proceeding in an action instituted by the state to enjoin the plaintiff herein from carrying on its operations for the reduction of fish or from using any fish of the variety known as "sardines" in the reduction plant upon the ship of plaintiff while situated at a certain place of anchorage, the court is entitled to take judicial notice of the political history of the world in determining whether the ship, where anchored, is within or without the boundaries of the state of California.—Ocean Industries, Inc., v. Superior Court, 235.

JURY TRIALS.

verdict; and it is the province and duty of the court to instruct the jury upon the law, and such instructions are binding on the latter in its deliberations.—Redo y Cia v. First Nat. Bank, 161.

2. TENDER OF VERDICT—EXCESS OF LEGAL LIABILITY—POWER OF COURT.—Where a jury tenders a verdict for an amount in excess of the lawful limit of liability on the part of the defendant, in violation of the court's instructions, the court has the right to refuse to receive the verdict, and a change in the verdict to come within the limit of legal liability constitutes an amendment which can properly be made before the verdict is recorded and prior to the discharge of the jury; and the fact that such amendment was made by the jury under compulsion of the court is not significant, as the jurors are not at liberty to refuse obedience to the court's instructions on matters of law, any error of the court in its instructions being reviewable on appeal.—Id.

3. REFUSAL TO POLL JURY—LACK OF PREJUDICE.—Assuming that error is committed by a trial court in refusing a party's request for a poll of the jury, no prejudice results therefrom, where it appears that all the jurors were in favor of a verdict for the party and so announced themselves on the return of the verdict that was recorded.—Id.

LIENS.

1. PRIORITIES—CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION 2897, CIVIL CODE.—In order to determine the priority of different liens upon the same property, under section 2897 of the Civil Code, it is necessary to determine whether "other things are equal," aside from the time of their creation.—First Nat. Bank v. Silva, 494.

2. CONTRACT LIEN—STATUTORY LIEN—DETERMINATION OF PRIORITY—CONSTITUTIONAL LAW.—Where a lien is created by contract and a subsequent lien is created by reason of an existing statute, the wording of the statutes or codes determines the question of priority, as the contract lien is presumed to have been created with knowledge of the law; and if a statute existed providing for the creation of liens and determining their priority at the MECHANICS' LIENS. 861

time of the creation of the contract lien, no constitutional provisions are violated by giving precedence to a subsequently acquired statutory lien over a prior contract lien.—Id.

3. SECTION 3051, CIVIL CODE—CONSTRUCTION OF.—There is no difference in the legal meaning of the language used in section 3051 of the Civil Code in reference to the different liens there provided for, including agistors' liens, although there is some difference in the actual language used, and the lien is dependent upon the possession of the article upon which it is claimed and possession may be maintained until the lien is discharged by payment.—Id.

4. SECTION 3052, CIVIL CODE—CONSTRUCTION—LIEN CLAIMANTS—REMEDIES—PRIOR CHATTEL MORTGAGE.—Since the amendment of 1907 to section 3052 of the Civil Code, the right to sell the property upon which a lien is claimed is given to any one of the several classes of persons named in section 3051 of said code, including agistors, with the same right and privilege to convert the personal property into cash, irrespective of a prior chattel mortgage, as might have been exercised by anyone claiming a lien for repairs or alterations prior to the amendment of the first section.—Id.

MECHANICS' LIENS.

1. MATERIALMEN—RIGHT OF LIEN—WAIVER—RIGHT TO RECOVER ON BOND.—A materialman may waive, by agreement or otherwise, his right to a lien against the building for the construction of which he has furnished material, without in any way impairing his right to proceed against the sureties upon the undertaking given in compliance with section 1183 of the Code of Civil Procedure.—Fraters Glass etc. Co. v. Southwestern Const. Co., 688.

MUNICIPAL CORPORATIONS.

1. INCURRING BONDED INDEBTEDNESS—ELECTIONS FOR—CONSTRUCTION OF CONSTITUTION.—Section 18 of article XI of the constitution prohibits a city from incurring a bonded indebtedness, such as to provide for the installation of filter-beds in the filtration plant of the city, without the assent of two-thirds of the qualified electors thereof, voting at an election to be held for that purpose, but this section does not contain any permission for or prohibition against the submission of such proposition to the voters at the same election with propositions for other purposes.—City of Sacramento v. Goddard, 143.

2. SACRAMENTO CHARTER—CONSTRUCTION OF.—The words "so voting," as used in section 92 of the charter of the city of Sacramento, were intended to, and do, relate back to those electors who vote "Yes" or "No" on any particular bond proposition, and if two-thirds of the electors of the city voting on any separate proposition vote in favor thereof, the proposition is carried, notwithstanding it receives less than two-thirds of all votes cast at the election.—Id.

3. ZONING ORDINANCE—BERKELEY CHARTER—INITIATIVE AND REFERENDUM—CONSTRUCTION.—An ordinance amending a zoning ordinance of the City of Berkeley is within the initiative and referendum provisions of the charter of that city.—Dwyer v. City Council of Berkeley, 505. MUNICIPAL CORPORATIONS. 863

## MUNICIPAL CORPORATIONS (Continued).

4. **CONSTITUTIONALITY OF CHARTER.**—Initiative and referendum provisions of a freeholder's charter adopted by a city in pursuance of the provisions of article XI, section 8, of the state constitution, are valid and constitutional.—Id.

5. **EXERCISE OF LEGISLATIVE PREROGATIVE—ORDINANCES.**—Only ordinances of a municipality which involve an exercise of a legislative prerogative are subject to the initiative and referendum.—Id.

6. **ZONING ORDINANCES—POLICE POWER.**—Zoning ordinances are police power enactments designed for the promotion and perpetuation of the moral and material welfare of the people.—Id.

7. **POLICE REGULATION—CONSTITUTIONAL LAW.**—The power to enact police regulations is conferred upon cities by section 11 of article XI of the constitution; and municipalities are expressly authorized to establish districts or zones within which the use of property may be regulated by an act of the legislature passed in 1917 (Stats. 1917, p. 1419).—Id.

8. **BERKELEY CHARTER—INITIATIVE AND REFERENDUM—CONSTRUCTION.** Not only have the citizens of Berkeley in their charter failed to expressly exclude zoning ordinances from the operation of the initiative and referendum, but they have phrased the sections pertaining to these powers in such broad, general, and unambiguous language, as to impel the conclusion that it was intended that legislation on every municipal subject should, unless expressly or by clear and necessary implication excluded, be subject to a reference to the people for approval or rejection.—Id.

9. **ZONING ORDINANCE—REFERENDUM—EXCLUSION BY IMPLICATION.**—A zoning ordinance passed as an amendment to the general and comprehensive zoning law of the City of Berkeley is not excluded from the referendum provision of the charter of that city by necessary implication.—Id.

10. **LOCAL ORDINANCE—GENERAL VOTE ON.**—If it be conceded that a zoning ordinance is local in character and directly affects only a small proportion of the population of the city, there is nothing theoretically inconsistent in permitting the electorate of the entire city to pass upon it by a referendum election or to enact it by initiative proceedings.—Id.

11. **NATURE OF INITIATIVE AND REFERENDUM LAWS.**—By the enactment of initiative and referendum laws the people simply withdraw from the legislative body and reserve to themselves the right to exercise a part of their inherent legislative power.—Id.

12. **APPLICATION OF REFERENDUM PROVISIONS.**—Since the legislative body of a city exercises powers derived from the people, and the city council, the legislative body of the city, representing the electorate of the entire city, has authority to pass a zoning ordinance, no violence is done to principles of statutory construction in holding that the local character of the ordinance, if it be 864

MUNICIPAL CORPORATIONS (Continued).

such, is not of itself sufficient to preclude an application of the referendum.—Id.

13. GENERAL ZONING SCHEME—INTEREST OF ENTIRE MUNICIPALITY.—In view of the substantial interest which the electors of an entire municipality have in its zoning scheme, it cannot be held that because residents of a particular locality rezoning may be more immediately and apparently affected than are residents of other portions of the city, the broad initiative and referendum provisions of a city charter and the constitution do not apply to an amendment to the general zoning law which reclassifies a portion of the city's territory.—Id.

14. AMENDMENT TO ZONING LAW—RIGHT OF PROTEST—APPLICATION OF INITIATIVE AND REFERENDUM.—Although an application of the initiative and referendum provisions of the charter of Berkeley to an ordinance amending the general zoning ordinance of that city may deprive the residents of a reclassified district and of the area of protest of rights accorded them by the zoning law, when an amendment to the zoning law is passed by the city council, the proponents and opponents are given all the privileges and rights to express themselves in an open election that a democracy or republican form of government can afford to its citizens, and the constitutional right reserved by the people to submit legislative questions to a direct vote cannot be abridged by a procedural requirement of a superseded municipal ordinance dealing with the same subject of legislation.—Id.

15. RECLASSIFICATION—PASSAGE OF ORDINANCE—PROCEDURE.—An ordinance of the City of Berkeley providing that under ordinary conditions a majority vote of the council is sufficient to effect a reclassification under the zoning ordinance, but which further provides that in the event of protest filed representing twenty per cent or more of the area of the property included in the proposed reclassification, or twenty per cent or more of the frontage of property other than that proposed to be reclassified but within the area of protest, a reclassification may only be effected by a two-thirds vote of the council, affects only legislation by ordinance and has no influence upon direct legislation.—Id.

16. TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES—ACTION TO FORFEIT FRANCHISE—ISSUES.—In a proceeding by the state, upon the relation of a municipality, to forfeit a franchise granted by the municipality to erect and operate over its streets poles, masts, and other structures upon which to suspend wires and other appliances for the construction and maintenance of a telephone and telegraph system, the question of what the rights of the defendant are under section 536 of the Civil Code, if that section is still in force, and whether that section has been repealed by section 19 of article MUNICIPAL COURTS. 865

## MUNICIPAL CORPORATIONS (Continued).

XI of the constitution as amended in 1911, is not involved.—People v. Turlock Home Tel. etc. Co., 546.

17. **PLEADING—FORFEITURE.**—It is elementary that forfeitures are never favored by the courts, and in order to declare a forfeiture the allegations of the complaint and its proof in support thereof must be positive and explicit.—Id.

18. **FAILURE TO PAY TAX—INSUFFICIENCY OF COMPLAINT.**—In such a case, where a forfeiture is sought to be declared by reason of the defendant's failure to pay a franchise tax on certain of its gross earnings, the complaint is fatally defective in failing to show that the defendant has received earnings, and a general demurrer to the complaint was properly sustained for that reason; but as the defect may be overcome by amendment, the plaintiff should have an opportunity to further amend its complaint.—Id.

See Irrigation Districts 1, 2; Street Law, 1.

## MUNICIPAL COURTS.

1. **SMALL CLAIMS COURTS—CONSTRUCTION OF CONSTITUTION.**—The contention that by reason of the provisions of the constitution providing for the organization of municipal courts and the omission of the legislature to provide an inferior court for the city of Los Angeles with jurisdiction of claims not exceeding fifty dollars, there no longer exists in said city a forum in which such claims may be tried in accordance with the procedure prescribed by the general act creating small claims courts, cannot be maintained.—Hughes v. Municipal Court, 215.

2. **ACT ESTABLISHING MUNICIPAL COURTS—SUFFICIENCY OF TITLE—CONSTITUTIONAL LAW.**—The act authorizing the establishment of municipal courts (Stats. 1925, p. 648) sufficiently expresses in its title the subject (embodied in the act) referring to the continuance in existence of inferior or small claims courts.—Id.

3. **AUTHORITY TO CREATE INFERIOR COURTS.**—The provision of the constitution which authorized the legislature to create courts inferior to the municipal courts, construed with reference to all other provisions of the constitutional amendment authorizing municipal courts and the statute establishing small claims courts, forces the conclusion that it was not the intention of the legislature to deprive any judicial district of the state of the benefits of the summary procedure conferred by such statute, but that it was the evident intent of the amendment to continue in force such procedure as a part of the judicial system of the state, and, if necessary for the accomplishment of the object for which small claims courts were created, to authorize the legislature to create

## MUNICIPAL COURTS (Continued).

such additional inferior courts as the business of each municipality or community may require.—Id.

4. **SMALL CLAIMS COURTS—OBJECT OF.**—The small claims court was created primarily to avoid wasteful litigation and to reduce to a minimum costs of trial in cases where the demands are small.—Id.

5. **MUNICIPAL COURTS—JURISDICTION.**—The legislature may relieve the municipal court of the duties with which it is charged by the Small Claims Court Act by establishing a court of inferior jurisdiction which it is authorized to create, and unless the municipal court is so relieved it is required to finish all unfinished business pending in the court which it supplants and perform the duties that the law imposes upon the justice's court.—Id.

6. **DUTIES OF JUSTICE'S COURT.**—The legislature by providing the small claims court procedure did not set up a separate, independent judicial tribunal to be presided over by a judge elected or appointed exclusively to perform the duties prescribed by the small claims court statute, but made it the duty of the several justices of the peace of the state to enforce its provisions.—Id.

7. **ACT ESTABLISHING MUNICIPAL COURTS—CONSTRUCTION OF.**—Sections 26 and 27 of the act establishing municipal courts make it clear that the duties appended to the justices' courts by the Small Claims Court Act are transferred to the municipal courts unchanged in any material aspect.—Id.

8. **SECTION 831E ET SEQ., CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE—CONSTRUCTION OF.** The procedure adopted by section 831e et seq. of the Code of Civil Procedure is inapplicable to small claims court matters and was not intended to abolish the small claims court procedure.—Id.

## MURDERS. See Criminal Law, 5-8.

## NAVIGABLE WATERS.

1. **BAY OF MONTEREY—DEFINITION.**—The bay of Monterey, designated from its first discovery as a "bay," being a body of water having headlands approximately eighteen miles apart, with receding shores, giving a total width of twenty-two miles inside the headlands, with a total depth of approximately nine miles, satisfies the definition of a "bay" given by the lexicographers as a body of water around which the land forms a curve, or a recess or inlet between capes or headlands.—Ocean Industries, Inc., v. Superior Court, 235.

2. **TREATY OF GUADALUPE HIDALGO—TERRITORY ACQUIRED BY.**—By the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, between the United States and Mexico, the former acquired jurisdiction over the region therein ceded, both territorial and maritime, which Mexico had theretofore asserted, and which embraced all of the ports, harbors, bays, and inlets along the coast of California and for a considerable, though NAVIGABLE WATERS. 867

## NAVIGABLE WATERS (Continued).

perhaps indefinite, distance into the ocean, including dominion over the numerous islands lying therein adjacent to said coast.—Id.

3. FIRST CONSTITUTION OF CALIFORNIA—DESCRIPTION OF BOUNDARIES OF STATE—INCLUSION OF BAYS.—The language of article XII of the constitution of California adopted in 1849, describing the boundaries of the state, particularly in view of the past political history of the region, was clearly intended to embrace within the boundaries and jurisdiction of the state of California the entire area of all those several bays and harbors which indent its coast.—Id.

4. DEFINITION OF BOUNDARIES OF STATE BY LEGISLATURE—CONSTRUCTION OF ACT OF 1850.—The act of the first legislature of California, creating and defining the boundaries of the several counties of the state (Stats. 1850, p. 58) must be interpreted, if reasonably possible, so as to reconcile its terms with the language of the constitution, since it would not be presumed to be the intent of the legislature to do that which it would have no power to do, viz., to exclude from the jurisdiction of the state of California or its political subdivisions any of its land or water areas which had been embraced therein by the express terms of the constitution; and if there are any ambiguities in said act they are to be resolved in harmony with the text of the organic law.—Id.

5. COAST LINE—BOUNDARY INTO OCEAN.—The description in the act of 1850 (Stats. 1850, p. 58), with reference to the boundaries of Santa Cruz County, "thence down the middle of said river to the Bay of Monterey and three English miles into the ocean," did not mean by the italicized phrase "into the Bay," as this construction would not only do violence to the words of the act, but would exclude the larger portion of Monterey Bay from the boundaries and jurisdiction of the state of California despite the very plain inclusion therein of the entire bay according to the constitution; and the phrase "parallel to the coast" in said description is applied to the general coast line, regardless of the bays and inlets along the respective coast lines and may reasonably be interpreted to be consistent with the constitution which includes within the state boundaries all islands, harbors, and bays along and adjacent to the coast.—Id.

6. JURISDICTION OVER MONTEREY BAY—ADOPTION OF POLITICAL CODE—BOUNDARIES.—The legislature in the adoption of the Political Code in 1872 left the boundary of the county of Santa Cruz substantially unchanged on its oceanward side but changed the boundary description of the county of Monterey to read, "beginning in the Pacific Ocean at the southwest corner of Santa Cruz," etc., and the entire bay of Monterey within its headlands and thence into the ocean for a distance of three nautical miles was thus definitely placed 868 NAVIGATION

## NAVIGABLE WATERS (Continued).

within the sovereignty of the state of California and within the boundaries and jurisdiction respectively of the counties of Santa Cruz and Monterey.—Id.

7. **JURISDICTION OVER BAYS—EXTENT OF—INTERNATIONAL LAW.**—The contention that by the rules of international law territorial jurisdiction of a maritime state does not extend beyond three miles from the shore line and follows the indentations of the coast into all bays or gulfs, the headlands of which are more than six miles apart, cannot be maintained, as, while it is true that by treaties and conventions between the powers chiefly in arbitration cases the fixation of a six-mile distance between headlands of certain bays and inlets has at times been agreed upon in the settlement of international disputes, it cannot be said that there is any rule of international law upon the subject, the whole matter resting in the undisputed assertion of jurisdiction by the power possessing the inclosing shore line of the bay or inlet in question.—Id.

8. **BAY OF MONTEREY—BOUNDARIES OF STATE.**—The bay of Monterey between its headlands and the ocean adjacent to a line drawn between these headlands for a distance of three nautical miles is within the boundaries of the state of California and of the counties respectively of Santa Cruz and Monterey.—Id.

9. **JURISDICTION OF SUPERIOR COURT—INJUNCTION.**—The superior court of Santa Cruz County has jurisdiction of an action to enjoin a corporation from carrying on the business of catching sardines and the reduction thereof for the production of fish-meal and oil, on its ship anchored in Monterey Bay, in violation of the laws of California, although said point of anchorage is more than three and one-half miles distant from the nearest low-water mark. Id.

## NEGLIGENCE.

1. **AUTOMOBILE ACCIDENT—PLACING TRUCK ACROSS HIGHWAY—SUFFICIENCY OF EVIDENCE.**—The placing of a truck loaded with a steel girder, which projected beyond the end of the truck, across the highway, in such position that the truck and girder covered the whole highway, at a time when it was dark and when there was considerable traffic passing on the highway, without lights except lanterns attached to either end of the steel girder, was negligence; and the owner of the truck is liable for damages for the death of a party who, while driving an automobile along the highway, ran into the steel girder and was killed.—Miller v. Lyons, 232. NEGLIGENCE. 869

NEGLIGENCE (Continued).

2. FINDINGS—SUFFICIENCY OF EVIDENCE—APPEAL.—When there is evidence ample to justify the findings and judgment of the trial court they will not be disturbed on appeal.—Id.

3. EMPLOYER AND EMPLOYEE—DEFENSES—ASSUMPTION OF RISK—ROSEBERRY ACT.—Under the Roseberry Act, assumption of the risk of the employment is no defense to an action by an employee against his employers for damages for alleged negligence, and the doctrine of relative negligence modifies the old rule of contributory negligence.—Robinet v. Hawks, 265.

4. WANT OF ORDINARY OR REASONABLE CARE OF EMPLOYER—CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE OF EMPLOYEE.—Under the Roseberry Act, an employee may recover if he is injured in the course of his employment through the want of ordinary or reasonable care of the employer; and in such cases the fact that the employee may have been guilty of contributory negligence does not bar a recovery where his contributory negligence was slight and the negligence of the employer was gross in comparison.—Id.

5. ACTION BY FARM HAND—NEGLIGENCE OF EMPLOYER.—In an action by a teamster, whose duty it was to drive a team in an orchard to gather loaded boxes of fruit, for damages for injuries received by him when thrown from the wagon by a sudden lurch, the jury was justified in finding the defendant negligent in allowing a deep hole in the ground to remain where the employee was expected to go, into which the wagon-wheel sank to the hub, throwing the employee to the ground, the view of which hole was hidden by the presence of grasses and weeds, also in not providing a wagon which had either a seat or a stanchion or some other device with which the employee might steady himself in case of emergency, and in providing no means of holding the boxes of fruit on the wagon floor to prevent the bottom layer of boxes from sliding off in case of a sudden lurch or tilting of the wagon.—Id.

6. CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE.—In such an action, it cannot be said as a matter of law that the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence, to say nothing of gross negligence, in sitting on three of the fruit boxes piled one upon the other, to a height from forty-five to fifty inches, and thus driving the team, with no seat, stanchion, or other device by which he could hold on or steady himself.—Id.

7. GROSS OR CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE—QUESTIONS FOR JURY.—In such a case, the questions of gross or contributory negligence, like the question of negligence on the part of the plaintiff, are proper questions, under the evidence, for the consideration of the jury alone.—Id.

8. INSTRUCTIONS—ASSUMPTION OF RISK—DEGREE OF CARE.—An instruction to the jury, in such a case, which, standing alone, would 870 NEGLIGENCE.

NEGLIGENCE (Continued).

be erroneous in that it excludes application of the principle that the employers are required to exercise only reasonable care in seeing that the place and tools of employment provided for their employees are safe, is not prejudicial to the employers, where all the instructions, when read as a whole, are not erroneous and are in reality more favorable to the defendants than the law requires.—Id.

9. EVIDENCE—CUSTOM.—In such a case, there was no injury to the defendants in sustaining objection to a question as to whether it was customary to furnish anything for the teamsters to hold to on the wagon, where another witness was allowed to testify without objection to the method used by such teamsters.—Id.

10. USAGE—INADMISSIBILITY OF.—The doctrine of customary usage does not apply to the question of legal duty under the law of negligence.—Id.

11. PERSONAL INJURIES—COLLISION OF AUTOMOBILE WITH MOTORCYCLE—DAMAGES—WAGES.—In an action to recover damages for personal injuries sustained in a collision between defendant's automobile and plaintiff's motorcycle, based upon the alleged negligence of the defendant, testimony of the plaintiff as to the daily wage he was receiving when injured, and that, but for the injury, he would have been receiving the same amount at the time of the trial, did not prejudice the case of the defendant.—Mellar v. Hooper, 628.

12. INSTRUCTIONS—BURDEN OF PROOF.—In such a case an instruction, in effect, that it was incumbent on plaintiff to prove his case to a "moral certainty" was not a correct statement of the law in civil causes, but it was more injurious to the plaintiff than to the defendant; and the fact that the instruction referred only to the burden of proof of the plaintiff, and made no reference to the evidence necessary to establish contributory negligence, did not constitute error.—Id.

13. ELEMENTS OF DAMAGE—PHYSICAL PAIN AND MENTAL ANXIETY—FUTURE DAMAGE—CONSTRUCTION.—In such a case where the jury was told in effect that it might consider as an element of damage such physical pain and mental anxiety as it found plaintiff suffered, or must necessarily suffer in the future, the contention that the word "necessarily" impliedly conveyed to the jury the court's view that the injury sustained by plaintiff would continue to exist in the future, which was a question to be passed upon by the jury, is without merit.—Id.

14. FUTURE DAMAGE.—In such a case plaintiff is not limited to damages for past suffering and pain, and the jury has a right to include in its award damages for future pain and suffering certain to result; and an instruction that the jury may consider such injuries as the plaintiff must necessarily suffer is but another way of say- NEGLIGENCE. 871

NEGLIGENCE (Continued).

ing that the jury may consider such injury as will be certain to result.—Id.

15. FINDINGS—SUFFICIENCY OF EVIDENCE.—In this action for damages for injuries received by a boy while attempting to climb upon a truck owned by one of the defendants and operated by the other, upon the theory that the defendants were guilty of negligence, it is held that, as a matter of fact and of law, the evidence showed that the injury was caused by the negligence of plaintiff without any contributing factor of the defendants; and that the evidence sustained the findings of the trial court in favor of defendants.—Norland v. Gould, 706.

16. PERSONAL INJURIES—INSTRUCTIONS—QUESTION FOR JURY.—In an action for damages for personal injuries received by a passenger of an automobile bus in a collision between the bus and an electric car at a public highway crossing, where there was evidence tending to show that the driver of the bus stopped a short distance from the tracks of the railway and looked to the right and left before attempting to cross said tracks, and the driver and a passenger testified that they were unable, after glancing to the right and left, to see the approaching car of the defendant's electric railway, it was error for the trial court to instruct the jury, as a matter of law, that the driver of the bus was negligent, and the question of fact should have been submitted to the jury.—Forbell v. Pacific Electric Ry. Co., 718.

17. PERSONAL INJURIES—CONFLICTING EVIDENCE—APPEAL.—Where there is a direct and sharp conflict in the evidence in an action to recover for personal injuries on the ground of defendant's negligence and there is nothing inherently improbable in the story of plaintiff, the judgment of the trial court cannot be disturbed on appeal.—Neilson v. Houle, 726.

18. REVIEW ON APPEAL—RULE.—Where the undisputed circumstances show that the story told by a litigant and his witnesses cannot by any possibility be true, or when their testimony is inherently impossible, an appellate court should not hesitate to reverse the judgment, to the end that the cause again may be submitted to the determination of the jury or trial judge; but unless the court on appeal can say that, under the undisputed physical facts, in an action for damages for personal injuries, the accident could not possibly have been due to defendant's negligence as alleged in the complaint, a judgment for plaintiff must be affirmed on appeal.—Id.

19. ACTION FOR DAMAGE—DEATH OF TORT-FEASOR—ABATEMENT OF ACTION—APPEAL.—A person who suffers a personal injury in the course of his employment at the hands of a tort-feasor who is not his employer cannot, after a judgment rendered against him in the 872 NEGLIGENCE.

lower court, continue to prosecute an appeal pending in the supreme court, after the death of said tort-feasor, as such an action, both at common law and under the general provisions of the statutes of this state, abates upon the death of the tort-feasor.—De la Torre v. Johnson, 754.

20. PERSONAL INJURIES—DEATH OF PARTIES—ABATEMENT OF ACTION.—The general rule is that a cause of action for personal injuries, in the absence of a statute expressly providing to the contrary, abates upon the death of either the persons injured or the tort-feasor.—Id.

21. WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION, INSURANCE AND SAFETY ACT—CONSTRUCTION.—The contention that section 26 of the Workmen's Compensation, Insurance and Safety Act (Stats. 1917, p. 831) authorizes the continuance of an action to recover damages for personal injuries made compensable under the provisions of said act, which are caused by the negligence of a tort-feasor other than the employer, after the death of said negligent third party, by the substitution of his personal representatives, cannot be maintained.—Id.

22. RIGHTS AGAINST TORT-FEASOR.—The Workmen's Compensation, Insurance and Safety Act does not attempt or purport to grant any right against a tort-feasor to the person who, at the time of the injury, was an employee of a third person that is not accorded to every other member of society similarly situated with respect to casualties which have no relation to the status of employer and employee.—Id.

23. CONSTRUCTION OF ACT.—The portion of section 26 of the Workmen's Compensation, Insurance and Safety Act reading, "The death of the employee, or any other person, shall not abate any right of action established by this section," must be construed in connection with and with reference to the subject matter of the act and its manifest object, and its sole and primary object is to fasten a liability on "all employers to compensate their employees for any injury incurred by said employees in the course of their employment, irrespective of the fault of either party."—Id.

24. COMPENSATION—DAMAGES—RIGHT OF ACTION.—The compensation provided in the Workmen's Compensation, Insurance and Safety Act is not damages in the sense that the latter term is used in ordinary tort actions; and the right to recover damages for personal injuries is not a right of action established by said act, but a common-law right established long before the adoption of said act.—Id.

25. RIGHT OF ACTION BY EMPLOYER.—The right of action of the employer to prosecute a suit against the tort-feasor to recover any compensation which he has paid or has become obligated to pay is PARTNERSHIP. 873

NOTICE.

SERVICE—MAILING.—The service by mail authorized by section 1012 of the Code of Civil Procedure does not contemplate a delivery as a part of the service, where the service is made as provided by section 1013 of said code; and the fact that a notice of motion to dismiss an appeal alleged to have been served by mail was not received by the person upon whom it was to be served does not support the claim that an affidavit of mailing the notice was false and fraudulent.—McKeon v. Sambrano, 739.

2. COMPENSATION OF PARTNERS—FINDINGS—SUFFICIENCY OF EVIDENCE. In this action between partners, it is held that the evidence was 874

sufficient to sustain a finding of the trial court that the plaintiff gave his entire time to the partnership business and was entitled to compensation as agreed upon.—Id.

3. **Advances by Partners—Reimbursement.**—In an action between partners, where it is admitted by the pleadings that the plaintiff and the defendant were to share the losses and the profits equally between them, if the plaintiff advanced more money for the partnership than the defendant did, there was an implied contract that the defendants would repay their proportion of the money advanced.—Id.

4. **Interest—Time.**—In an action between partners, where the evidence is sufficient to sustain a finding that it was agreed that plaintiff should receive interest on moneys advanced by him to the partnership, plaintiff is entitled to interest up to the time of the dissolution of the partnership.—Id.

5. **Payment of Interest—Time.**—Where there is an express agreement between partners to pay interest on advances made by one partner to the partnership to a certain date, no general rule as to an implied agreement therefor has any application.—Id.

PRISONERS.

1. EMPLOYMENT ON HIGHWAYS—COMPENSATION FOR INJURIES.—A convict engaged in the performance of labor on the state highway, under the provisions of chapter 316 of the Laws of 1923, is an employee within the meaning of the constitution and the Workmen's Compensation Act.—Highway Commission v. Industrial Acc. Com., 44.

2. DEPRIVATION AND RESTORATION OF CIVIL RIGHTS—POWER OF LEGISLATURE.—The power to deprive a prisoner of his civil rights is one that resides in the legislature, and this power includes the corresponding power to restore them.—Id.

3. CONVICT ROAD CAMP BILL—CONSTRUCTION OF.—The Convict Road Camp Bill (Stats. 1923, c. 316, p. 667), partially restores to convicts their civil rights and authorizes those who are afforded the privilege to enter into a contract of employment with the State Highway Commission, which entitles them to all the rights under the act, one of which is the benefits enjoyed by employees under the Workmen's Compensation Act.—Id.

4. COMPENSATION—GIFTS—POWER OF LEGISLATURE—CONSTITUTIONAL LAW.—The legislature, having power to restore the suspended civil rights of a convict and to compensate him for the character of work provided by the Convicts Road Camp Bill, the sums provided for do not constitute a gift under section 34 of article IV of the constitution.—Id.

## PROMISSORY NOTES.

1. TRANSFER TO COMAKER—EXTINGUISHMENT OF OBLIGATION.—Indorsement and delivery of promissory notes for a valuable consideration, by the payee, to a comaker of the notes extinguishes the obligations upon them.—Bailes v. Keck, 698.

2. ACTION ON NOTES—DEMURRER—NOTICE.—In an action based solely upon the obligation evidenced by promissory notes, which were assigned by the payee, for a valuable consideration, to the comakers of the notes, who in turn assigned them to the plaintiff in the action, in which action no attempt was made to state a cause of action in assumpsit upon an implied promise of the makers for a contribution, or upon any theory upon which relief could have been granted, a demurrer to the complaint was properly sustained, as the notes and indorsements gave actual notice to the assignee that they were assigned by the comakers for a valuable consideration.—Id.

3. PLEADING—CONCLUSIONS OF LAW.—In such an action allegations in an amended complaint that the notes were acquired by the comakers for the sole purpose of transferring the same to plaintiff and that neither of said comakers became the holders of said notes in his own right, that said notes were not at the time of the transfer thereof by the payee to the comakers paid, that neither of the comakers was released from the obligations upon said notes at any time by the payee, and that each of them is liable thereon as a maker of said notes and that plaintiff is the owner and holder thereof for the purpose of collection, are legal conclusions which cannot be permitted to supply essential allegations of fact.—Id.

4. MOTION TO SET ASIDE DISMISSAL—LACK OF ABUSE OF DISCRETION. In this action on promissory notes it is held that there is no showing of abuse of discretion by the trial court in refusing to set aside an order of dismissal of the action and for leave to amend the complaint.—Id.

5. TRANSFER BY PAYEE TO COMAKERS—EXTINGUISHMENT OF OBLIGATION.—The judgment and order appealed from in this case are affirmed upon the authority of Bailes v. Keck et al, ante, p. 698.—Bailes v. Keck, 800.

## PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS. See Appeal, 2; Reclamation Districts, 4, 5, 7. PUBLIC OFFICERS. 877

# PUBLIC OFFICERS.

1. **COMPENSATION—COUNTY CLERK—SECTION 4290, POLITICAL CODE.**—Section 4290 of the Political Code, providing that the salaries therein provided shall be in full compensation of all services rendered by county officers either as officers or *ex-officio* officers, does not attempt to deal with the question as to whether county officers can or cannot perform services for their respective counties outside of their official duties and be compensated for such services; and a county clerk is eligible to the position of purchasing agent of the county, by appointment of the board of supervisors, and is entitled to receive the compensation agreed to be paid him for his services in said position.—Mousseau v. Garey, 201.

2. **POWERS OF.**—A public officer or board has not only the powers expressly enumerated by law, but also those implied powers which are necessary to the exercise of the powers expressly granted.—Crawford v. Imperial Irr. Dist., 318.

3. **COUNTY SURVEYOR—FIXING SALARY—CONSTITUTIONAL LAW.**—Where the compensation of a county surveyor is not fixed at the time of his election, the constitutional provisions prohibiting the increase of the compensation of an officer during his term of office (sec. 9, art. XI, of the constitution) does not prevent the fixing thereof after his term begins.—Arnold v. Sullenger, 632.

4. **COUNTY OFFICERS—COMPENSATION—DELEGATION OF POWER TO FIX—CONSTITUTIONAL LAW.**—A county surveyor is a county officer, and in view of the provisions of section 5 of article XI of the constitution, the legislature cannot directly delegate to a board of supervisors the power to fix his compensation.—Id.

5. **REGULATION OF COMPENSATION—CONSTRUCTION OF CONSTITUTION.**—The word "regulate," as used in section 5 of article XI of the constitution, has always been deemed to mean "to fix" or "to establish," and no other signification may now properly be attached to that word in the connection in which it is so employed in said section of the constitution.—Id.

6. **SECTION 4044, POLITICAL CODE—CONSTRUCTION.**—Although the legislature purported to fix a maximum of ten dollars per day to the compensation that might be fixed by the board of supervisors for a county surveyor under section 4044 of the Political Code, still the section attempts to vest in the board of supervisors the power in its discretion to fix said compensation within the limits specified.—Id.

7. **DELEGATION OF POWERS—SECTION 4044, POLITICAL CODE—INVALIDITY OF.**—Section 4044 of the Political Code, in so far as it attempts to delegate to the board of supervisors the power to fix the compensation of the county surveyor, is invalid, or contrary to section 5 of article XI of the constitution.—Id. 878 PUBLIC POLICY.

PUBLIC OFFICERS (Continued).

8. COUNTY SURVEYOR—COMPENSATION—SECTION 4242, POLITICAL CODE.—CONSTRUCTION.—Where there was no law in force, at the time of the election of the respondent to the office of county surveyor of the county of Contra Costa, which fixed his compensation, the amendment of section 4242 of the Political Code in 1923, fixing such compensation at six thousand dollars per annum, did not constitute an increase during his term of office as contemplated by section 9 of article XI of the constitution.—Id.

RECLAMATION DISTRICTS.

1. POLICE POWER—ACTION BY LEGISLATURE—PRESUMPTION OF KNOWLEDGE—DETERMINATION OF BENEFITS.—The creation of a reclamation district is an exercise of the police power of the state; and the legislature, which has the power to create, is presumed to act with knowledge of the facts and upon a determination of the benefits to the land included within the boundaries of such a district by the proposed work of reclamation.—Islais Creek Rec. Dist., v. All Persons, 277.

2. STATUTORY CONSTRUCTION—CONSTITUTIONAL LAW.—An act of the legislature should not be declared unconstitutional by the courts unless its provisions are clearly violative of some provision of the constitution; and the courts of this state have liberally construed acts of the legislature creating reclamation and other improvement districts, because of the public benefit derived therefrom.—Id.

3. ISLAIS CREEK RECLAMATION DISTRICT—PURPOSE OF.—The purposes of the Islais Creek Reclamation District clearly bring the act creating the district within the scope of the power of the legislature.—Id.

4. PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS—CONTRIBUTION TO GENERAL WELFARE.—Whatever tends to enlarge the resources, increase the industrial energies, and promote the productive power of any considerable number of the inhabitants of a section of the state, or which leads RECLAMATION DISTRICTS. 879

**RECLAMATION DISTRICTS (Continued).**

to the growth of towns and the creation of new sources for the employment of private capital and labor, indirectly contributes to the general welfare and to the prosperity of the whole community. Id.

5. **PROMOTION OF COMMERCE AND NAVIGATION—DRAINAGE AND RECLAMATION—EXERCISE OF POLICE POWER.**—Commerce and navigation generally, and particularly in the harbor of San Francisco, will be benefited by the improvement contemplated by the Islais Creek Reclamation District Act; but the drainage and reclamation of the lands, apart from any question of commerce or navigation, are in themselves a legitimate exercise of the police power of the state.—Id.

6. **PLAN AND PROVISION FOR WORKS—POWER OF LEGISLATURE.**—It was within the power of the legislature, in creating the Islais Creek Reclamation District by a special act, to define the manner and plan and provide for the necessary works by which the contemplated reclamation should be carried out.—Id.

7. **ASSESSMENTS—PUBLIC PURPOSE—BENEFIT TO FEW.**—While all assessments must be made for a public purpose, it is no objection to the constitutionality of a reclamation district act that the public benefit which is to be subserved is practically limited to those in the district whose lands are to be protected; and the state has the power to impose upon the adjacent lands specially benefited by the work an assessment in proportion to such benefits to defray part of the costs.—Id.

8. **TITLE OF ACT—CONSTITUTIONAL LAW.**—The Islais Creek Reclamation District Act, which provides that the district may fill the land and streets therein held in private ownership and raise them to the official street grades as the same may be now or hereafter legally established, does not violate section 24, article IV, of the constitution, because the title does not specifically refer to the filling in of the lands and streets, the title being broad enough to disclose that the general purpose of the act is to provide a scheme for the betterment of the lands lying within the described area.—Id.

9. **FIXING OF BOUNDARIES OF DISTRICT—DETERMINATION OF BENEFITS.** Where the legislature itself fixes the exterior boundaries of a reclamation district, its determination as to the property benefited and the property to be included in the district is final and conclusive, and an attempt by an owner of lands in the district to show that they were not overflowed lands, in a proceeding to determine the legality of the district, would be futile.—Id.

10. **ASSESSMENT FOR RECLAMATION AND IRRIGATION—APPLICATION OF SECTION 3455, POLITICAL CODE.**—Section 3455 of the Political Code, as amended in 1917 and 1919 (Stats. 1917, p. 1197, and Stats. 1919, p. 604), is applicable to proceedings taken by the trustees and officers of a reclamation district, which is within the Sacra- 880

mente and San Joaquin Drainage District, for the levying of an assessment for reclamation and irrigation purposes.—Hershey v. Reclamation Dist. No. 108, 550.

11. PLEADINGS—FRAUD.—Fraud is never to be presumed, but it must be affirmatively pleaded and proved, or the facts from which it is to be inferred must be of such character that no other reasonable conclusion may be reached but the single one of evil design on the part of the person or entity whose acts are attempted to be impugned.—Id.

12. OBJECTION TO ASSESSMENT—SECTION 3462, POLITICAL CODE.—Section 3462 of the Political Code requires an objector to an assessment for reclamation and irrigation to specify the grounds of objection to the assessment, and unless this be done the decision of the board of supervisors becomes final, and the assessment list is conclusive evidence that said assessment has been made and levied according to law.—Id.

13. PLANS FOR RECLAMATION—APPROVAL BY STATE RECLAMATION BOARD—SECTION 3455, POLITICAL CODE.—Under section 3455 of the Political Code, the action of the state board of reclamation in approving, modifying, or rejecting any original, supplementary or new plan of reclamation, after a hearing as therein provided, is final; and thereafter the sufficiency of such plans cannot be attacked either before the reclamation board or in any court.—Id.

14. CONSTITUTIONAL LAW.—The provisions of section 3455 of the Political Code deny to the property owners no constitutional right.—Id.

15. STATUTES—CONSTITUTIONAL OBJECTIONS—WAIVER—ESTOPPEL.—The right to question the constitutionality of a statute may be waived; and it is a general rule applicable in civil cases that a constitutional question must be raised at the earliest opportunity or it will be considered as waived. One who receives a benefit from an unconstitutional law is estopped from denying its unconstitutionality.—Id.

16. CREATION OF RECLAMATION AND IRRIGATION DISTRICTS—POWER OF LEGISLATURE.—The legislature has the power to create, by special acts, reclamation or irrigation districts; and it has the power to merge or consolidate into a unified system two established systems of bringing arid and swamp and overflowed lands into a state of cultivability and productiveness.—Id.

17. RECLAMATION DISTRICT NO. 108—CREATION AND POWERS OF.—Reclamation District No. 108 exists as a creature of special statutory enactments, and it is given broad powers in addition to the powers conferred by general laws.—Id.

18. AMENDMENT OF 1917—APPLICATION OF POLITICAL CODE.—All reclamation districts existing in this state at the time of and prior to the 1917 amendment formed under any statute of the state were subject to the provisions of the Political Code relating to reclama- RENT. 881
## RECLAMATION DISTRICTS (Continued).

tion districts just as though such districts had been formed by or created under the provisions of the code relating to swamps and overflowed, salt marsh, and tide lands.—Id.

19. **SECTION 3455, POLITICAL CODE—TITLE OF ACT AMENDING.**—The title of the act amending section 3455 of the Political Code was expressive of the subject of the act if the term "reclamation" can be said to be sufficiently comprehensive to include irrigation.—Id.

20. **RECLAMATION AND IRRIGATION—STATUTORY CONSTRUCTION.**—The two methods to reclaim land, to wit, reclamation and irrigation, are germane to a general purpose and in accord with the policy of the government; and the term "reclamation" in a statute is sufficiently broad and comprehensive to include the irrigation of lands which are rendered excessively dry and arid in the summer season by reason of the shutting out of the storm and flood water of winter.—Id.

21. **ASSESSMENTS—INTEREST—APPEAL.**—It will be presumed on appeal in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that the officers of a reclamation district in computing interest on past expenses to be included in an assessment, computed it on a basis not exceeding its legal rate; and the trial court having heard the evidence addressed to the issues and having found thereon, its finding will not be interfered with on appeal unless, as a matter of law, it appears to be erroneous.—Id.

22. **RECLAMATION AND IRRIGATION—VALIDITY OF ASSESSMENT.**—The judgment in this case is affirmed upon the authority of *Hershey et al. v. Reclamation District No. 108 et al., ante, p. 550.*—Browning v. Reclamation Dist. No. 108, 800.

23. **RECLAMATION AND IRRIGATION—VALIDITY OF ASSESSMENT.**—The judgment in this case is affirmed upon the authority of *Hershey et al. v. Reclamation District No. 108 et al., ante, p. 550.*—Browning v. Reclamation Dist. No. 108, 800.

JURY TRIAL—WAIVER—DISCRETION.—Under section 129 of the Code of Civil Procedure every court of record may make rules not inconsistent with the laws of this state, for its own government and the government of its officers; and under the constitution a trial by jury may be waived in civil actions by the consent of the parties, signified in such manner as may be prescribed by law.—Norland v. Gould, 706.

2. DISCRETION—APPEAL.—A rule of the superior court requiring a party desiring a trial by jury in a civil action to deposit with the clerk a certain number of days in advance of the trial a certain amount for jury fees is valid; and the exercise by the trial court of its discretion in denying an application for continuance and for a jury trial, upon the ground that the rule was not complied with, will not be disturbed on appeal.—Id.

SECTION 1617½, POLITICAL CODE—CONSTRUCTION—CONSTITUTIONAL LAW.—By the amendment of 1919 (Stats. 1919, p. 399), to section 1617½ of the Political Code, the legislature not only made the section apply to boards of trustees of any school district, and boards of trustees of union high schools or joint union high school districts, as well as to city boards of education, but struck from its provisions all reference to a daily average attendance; and there SIGNATURES. 883

## SCHOOLS AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS (Continued).

is, therefore, nothing in the section itself to support the contention that it is unconstitutional as being special legislation and provides for an arbitrary and discriminatory classification of school districts.—Los Angeles City School Dist. v. Odell, 637.

2. **TITLE OF AMENDING ACT.—CONSTRUCTION.**—The fact that the title to the act of 1919 amending section 1617½ of the Political Code retains the words "a total average daily attendance exceeding fifty-five thousand," which provision is not contained in the body of the act, does not render it unconstitutional.—Id.

3. **STATUTORY CONSTRUCTION—CONSTITUTIONAL LAW.**—While the title of an act may be relied upon in ascertaining the intention of the legislature, where the act itself is ambiguous, the title cannot be used for the purpose of restraining or controlling any positive provision of the act.—Id.

4. **REVISION OF STATUTES—CONSTRUCTION.**—A revised act must be construed as a new and original piece of legislation, and, if possible, effect must be given to every part thereof.—Id.

5. **SECTION 1617½, POLITICAL CODE—AMENDMENT OF 1919—CONSTRUCTION.**—The act of 1919 amending section 1617½ of the Political Code (Stats. 1919, p. 399), does not violate section 24 of article IV of the constitution by referring to certain subjects apparently not included nor mentioned in its title. This statute was intended to authorize and sanction the sale and leasing of public school property by the enumerated boards, and this purpose is fairly discernible from the title to the act and all the provisions need not have been set forth in the title.—Id.

6. **SCHOOL PROPERTY—SECTION 1617½, POLITICAL CODE.**—The language of section 1617½ of the Political Code, "upon which no public school is being maintained," with reference to the sale of land of a school district, is broad enough to include a public high school; but the fact that land is under lease to a high school district does not prevent the board of education from entering into a contract to sell the land where the time for delivery of title under the contract is beyond the expiration of the lease.—Id.

TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES.

1. TELEGRAPH COMPANIES—FEDERAL FRANCHISE—ACT OF 1866.—Under the act of Congress passed July 24, 1866, to "Aid in the construction of telegraph lines," etc. (14 Stats. at Large, 221, c. 230; Rev. Stats., secs. 5263–5268), where a telegraph company files its written acceptance of the restrictions and obligations of the statute, the rights and privileges conferred upon the company thereunder constitute a federal franchise and the company has the right to construct, maintain, and operate its lines over and along the public roads and highways of the United States, while kept up and maintained as such, irrespective of whether mail is actually being carried thereon, either by way of city letter-carriers or in rural delivery.—Postal Tel.-Cable Co. v. Railroad Com., 463.

2. AUTHORITY OF CONGRESS—AUTHORITY OF STATE.—As Congress has authority to say that a telegraph company may construct and operate its telegraph lines over public roads and highways of the United States, a state has no authority to say it shall not be done, and cannot, by a specific statute, prevent the company from placing its lines along the post-roads, or stop the use of them after they are placed there.—Id.

3. GOVERNMENTAL FUNCTION.—By said act of Congress, and its acceptance by a telegraph company, the latter becomes an instrumentality of the United States in carrying out its governmental functions, and an agency of the federal government for the transaction of its postal business, and an agent of interstate and foreign commerce.—Id.

4. RIGHT OF STATE TO REGULATE TELEGRAPH COMPANIES.—The state and its municipalities have the right to impose upon a telegraph company, under the police power, reasonable regulations with reference to the manner of the exercise by it of the rights conferred by the national government, but these powers are regulatory, and not prohibitory; and the state cannot so interfere with its operation, even under the assumed guise of the exercise of the police power, as to work a prohibition of any part of its business; and the regulations of the state must not be arbitrary, unreasonable, nor such as have the effect of excluding the company from the state or forbidding it to carry on its business therein.—Id. 886
TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES.

TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES (Continued).

5. AUTHORITY OF FEDERAL FRANCHISE—UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION. The authority for a "federal franchise" possessed by a telegraph company which has accepted the provisions of the act of Congress of July 24, 1866, to "Aid in the construction of telegraph lines," etc., is the provision of the United States constitution giving Congress the power to establish postoffices and post-roads; and under this provision the power of the national government is exclusive, subject to the right of the state, under its police power, to make certain reasonable regulations as to the manner in which the business of the telegraph company shall be conducted.—Id.

6. ORDER OF RAILROAD COMMISSION—SUSPENSION OF POWER OF TELEGRAPH COMPANY.—An order of the Railroad Commission that a telegraph company, which has accepted the provisions of the act of Congress of July 24, 1866, and which is maintaining an interstate telegraph business, cease and desist from the operation of its line for intrastate business unless and until it shall have secured a certificate from the Commission that the present and future public convenience and necessity require, or will require, such operation, does not find support in the exercise of the police power of the state to regulate, but amounts to an attempt to exercise a power to prohibit, which violates the company's rights under the federal constitution and said act of Congress.—Id.

7. HIGHWAYS OF STATE—RIGHT OF TELEGRAPH COMPANY TO USE—SECTION 536, CIVIL CODE.—The rights acquired by a telegraph company, by accepting and availing itself of the provisions of section 536 of the Civil Code, are vested rights which the constitutions, both state and federal, protect; and they cannot be taken away by the state, even though the legislature should repeal the section, or by the people through a constitutional provision.—Id.

8. ACCEPTANCE OF STATE'S FRANCHISE.—The finding of the Railroad Commission of the physical fact that a telegraph company is maintaining and operating its lines of telegraph over the roads and highways of the state establishes, as a matter of law and of fact, the proposition that it has accepted and owns a state franchise for that purpose, which was offered to it by section 536 of the Civil Code.—Id.

9. CONSTRUCTION OF NEW LINES—PUBLIC UTILITIES ACT—CERTIFICATE OF PUBLIC CONVENIENCE AND NECESSITY.—The constitutional amendments of 1911 and the "Public Utilities Act" of 1911 cannot be held to have required a telegraph company, which had prior to the passage of said measures accepted the provisions of section 536 of the Civil Code, to procure a certificate of public convenience and necessity from the Railroad Commission for the construction of new lines.—Id.

**TRUSTS.**

1. **ESTATES OF DECEASED PERSONS—CLAIM—PLEADING—PROVISIONS OF COMPLAINT.**—In an action upon a claim against the estate of a deceased person, allegations of the complaint are sufficient to establish an express trust where it is averred that the plaintiff, who had confidence in the deceased for special reasons, deposited with the deceased a certain sum of money upon the representation of the deceased that he and another would hold the funds for plaintiff "as a trust fund" to be by them loaned to various persons such as they should elect, and that such funds would earn not less than twelve per cent per annum, that they would pay the plaintiff such interest as his money would earn from time to time, and that they would "repay to him the principal at such time as he should demand the same."—Mix v. Yoakum, 681.

2. **REJECTED CLAIM—ACTION ON.**—It is well settled that in an action on a rejected claim against the estate of a deceased person the claimant can only recover upon the cause of action set forth in his claim.—Id.

3. **CAUSES OF ACTION—DISTINCTION BETWEEN.**—There is a clear distinction between the cause of action of one who claims specific property held and claimed by the estate of a deceased person adversely to the claimant and a cause of action founded upon a claim against the estate; in the one case the claimant is in no sense a creditor of the estate and in the other he occupies the position of a creditor.—Id. 888

TRUSTS (Continued).

4. TRACING OF FUNDS—WHEN UNNECESSARY—GENERAL CREDITOR.—In such an action plaintiff is not compelled to allege and prove the specific fund or property in the hands of the estate into which his funds went, where he is seeking to recover as a general creditor. Id.

5. POSSESSION OF FUNDS—PLEADING—PARTIES—APPEAL.—The objection in such a case that the complaint does not allege that the funds are not in the possession of the party who, with the decedent, was possessed of them cannot be considered on appeal, the question involving the sufficiency of the complaint as against a special demurrer on the ground of a defect or misjoinder of parties defendant.—Id.

6. DEMAND—PLEADING.—In such an action it is not necessary to allege in the complaint a demand for the money made prior to the death of the decedent, or that there was any repudiation of the trust during the lifetime of the decedent. The cause of action did not accrue against the testator during his lifetime but did accrue against the executors of his estate.—Id.

7. STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.—The statute of limitations began to run in such a case upon the rejection of the claim by the executors or upon the demand upon the executors and their refusal to act.—Id.

8. REJECTION OF CLAIM—ELECTION.—The filing of the complaint after the expiration of the tenth day following the presentation of the claim to the executors, and within the statutory period, constituted an election on the part of the plaintiff to deem the claim rejected, and it was not necessary to allege in the complaint such fact.—Id.

9. PLEADING—PRAYER.—The fact that a plaintiff may have demanded more than he was entitled to does not render the complaint subject to demurrer on that ground.—Id.

10. JUDGMENT—PAYMENT.—A judgment in such case would necessarily have to be paid in due course of administration, as plaintiff was a general creditor, but it is not necessary to pray in the complaint that the judgment be so paid.—Id.

11. PLEADING—CONSTRUCTION.—Since the enactment of section 452 of the Code of Civil Procedure in 1872 it has been generally recognized that in the construction of a pleading for the purpose of determining its effect, its allegations must be liberally construed, with a view to substantial justice between the parties.—Id.

12. PRESUMPTIONS.—If it be assumed that there is a presumption against the pleader when the pleading is silent as to an essential averment, such presumption would not go to the length of requir- USURY LAW. 889

USURY LAW.

1. CONSTRUCTION—INTENT—CONSTITUTIONAL LAW.—The "Usury Law" (Stats. 1919, p. lxxxiii) was not intended to limit the charge for "examinations, views, fees, appraisals, commissions . . ." etc., made by the lender himself, but, on the contrary, the lender is to be denied all compensation or emoluments of every kind which will enlarge his return or profit on the loan beyond the maximum amount allowed by the act; and the provision with reference to charges "for examinations, views, fees, appraisals, commissions, renewals, etc.," was intended to regulate such charges when made by a third person or persons as part of the expense in connection with the loan.—Wallace v. Zinman, 585.

2. TITLE OF ACT—CONSTITUTIONAL LAW.—The subject matter covered by the title to the "Usury Law" is exclusively "usury," and the subject in said act with reference to charges and expenses of loan brokers, not being in the title, the act is unconstitutional, as far as that subject is concerned.—Id.

3. INITIATIVE MEASURE—TITLE OF ACT—CONSTITUTION.—The provision of section 24 of article IV of the constitution, requiring every act to embrace but one subject, which subject shall be expressed in its title, is applicable to a statute passed by the initiative method.—Id.

4. CHARACTER OF INITIATIVE MEASURE—APPLICATION OF CONSTITUTION. The contention that an initiative measure in its effect is a constitutional amendment and that as constitutional amendments need not conform to the provision of the constitution requiring every subject contained in the act to be expressed in its title, an initiative measure need not conform to this provision of the constitution, cannot be maintained.—Id. 890
USURY LAW.

USURY LAW (Continued).

5. ILLEGAL DISCRIMINATION—CONSTITUTIONAL LAW.—The "Usury Law" (Stats. 1919, p. lxxxiii), contains an unlawful discrimination between charges of brokers negotiating unsecured loans and the same character of charges in negotiating secured loans, also with reference to loans where the period of the loan is less than six months; and such provisions violate sections 11 and 21 of article I of the constitution of California, and the fourteenth amendment to the constitution of the United States and are void.—Id.

6. SEVERABLE PROVISIONS.—The above void provisions of the "Usury Law" are clearly severable from the other portions of the act.—Id.

7. CONSTRUCTION—EVIDENCES OF DEBT—CRIMINAL LAW.—By use, in section 3 of the "Usury Law" (Stats. 1919, p. lxxxiii), of the phrase, " . . . secured by mortgage . . . or other evidence of debt, except corporation bonds and municipal and other bonds . . .," is meant that no offense could be committed by a loan at any rate of interest, however large, upon such property as security; and the preceding words, such as mortgage, trust deed, bill of sale, assignment, pledge or receipt, should be construed to be in and of themselves evidence of debt in the broader sense of that term.—In re Washer, 598.

8. LOANS—DISCRIMINATION AS TO SECURITY—CONSTITUTIONAL LAW.—There is no intrinsic, economic, constitutional, or other reason for a discrimination between loans on ordinary security and loans upon corporate, municipal, or other public bonds, and as section 3 of the "Usury Law" makes such discrimination, this provision is void as being in contravention of the constitution.—Id.

9. SECTIONS 1 AND 2 OF USURY LAW—CONSTRUCTION.—Sections 1 and 2 of the "Usury Law" are intended to cover secured as well as unsecured loans.—Id.

10. CORPORATE BONDS—SALE AT DISCOUNT—LOANS.—The sale at discount by corporate borrowers, such as corporations, municipal, and other public corporations, of bonds of their own issue, is not a loan within the meaning of the "Usury Law," and was never intended to be subject to the operation of any of the provisions of this statute.—Id.

11. EFFECT ON OTHER STATUTES—CONSTRUCTION.—It was not the intent of the "Usury Law" to repeal or modify or impair the integrity of any existing laws relating to the issuance, sale, or negotiation of securities now authorized or supervised by any such laws.—Id.

12. LOAN ON CORPORATE SECURITIES—APPLICATION OF USURY LAW.—A loan upon corporate bonds as security in excess of the legal rate would be just as usurious as a loan on any other class of security.—Id. USURY LAW. 891

USURY LAW (Continued).

13. CONSTRUCTION—LIMIT OF INTEREST—COMPOUND INTEREST.—Under the "Usury Law" (Stats. 1919, p. lxxxiii), the maximum rate of twelve per cent per annum on the amount loaned is the full measure of all profit to the lender, and without the right to compound the interest; but it is competent for the parties to contract in writing for compound interest where in so doing the maximum rate of twelve per cent without such compounding would not be exceeded.—Haines v. Commercial Mortgage Co., 607.

14. SERVICES AND EXPENSE OF LENDER—RIGHT OF REIMBURSEMENT.—Under the "Usury Law," the lender may perform services or incur expenses in connection with the loan which will entitle him to reimburse himself from the fund about to be loaned, but these items must be confined to specific service or expense incidental to the loan, incurred in such a way as to absolutely preclude its being merely a device through which additional interest or profit on the loan may be exacted, and a court will carefully scrutinize the whole transaction and declare its substance regardless of its form.—Id.

15. EXCESS CHARGE.—Where a percentage charge on a loan by the borrower in excess of the maximum percentage allowed by the "Usury Law" cannot be allocated to any item of expense or service for which the lenders would legitimately make a charge or urge a claim, the loan is usurious and the lender forfeits all claim to interest, and the borrower may recover not only treble the excess but treble the entire amount of interest actually paid upon the loan.—Id.

16. AGREEMENT FOR EXCESS AMOUNT—FAILURE TO PAY—JUDGMENT.—Where the excess percentage agreed to be paid upon a loan in addition to the maximum percentage allowed by the "Usury Law" is not actually paid, it is not a proper item in a judgment for treble the amount allowed by the statute to be recovered.—Id.

17. PAYMENT—AGREEMENT FOR APPLICATION.—Where the parties to a loan have by special and specific agreement agreed as to what portion of a given payment shall be referred to principal and what shall be referred to interest, the court will adopt this understanding in applying the provisions of the "Usury Law."—Id.

18. SUIT IN EQUITY TO DECLARE A FORFEITURE AND ENJOIN A SALE—DISPOSAL OF ISSUES.—In a suit in equity to have a transaction declared in violation of the "Usury Act," the right to future interest declared forfeited, that no part of the principal be declared payable until the completion of the full period of time contemplated by the note, that plaintiff recover treble the amount of all interest paid, including treble the amount of the commission, and that a sale of the premises securing the loan be enjoined until the full period covered by the loan should have elapsed, the court should assume full and complete jurisdiction in the premises and 892
USURY LAW.

USURY LAW (Continued).

make and state the account between the parties and make plenary disposition of all the issues involved in the action.—Id.

19. NATURE OF ACTION.—While the provision of the "Usury Law" for a special right of action in the plaintiff for treble the amount of interest paid is in the nature of a penalty, the context of the act gives it more of the rating of an action for debt and, therefore, subject to offsets and counterclaims by defendants; and the plaintiffs in such an action waive the right to object to offsets and counterclaims by coming into a court of equity and praying for additional relief instead of the mere pronouncement of a judgment in forfeiture against the defendants.—Id.

20. DOING EQUITY—TENDER.—There is no merit in the contention in such an action that plaintiffs must first do equity by tendering the principal and such other items, excluding interest, as may be due under the obligation, before suit may be maintained for treble the interest paid.—Id.

21. NOTE PAYABLE IN INSTALLMENTS—USURIOUS INTEREST—APPLICATION OF PAYMENTS.—Where a promissory note provides for payment of principal and interest in monthly installments and that in default of payment of any installment when due the whole sum of principal and interest shall become immediately due and payable at the option of the holder of the note, if the agreement for payment of interest is usurious, all payments will be referred to the principal, but if default is made in the payment of an installment in full the note may be declared due and payable at the option of the holder.—Id.

22. FORFEITURE—PRINCIPAL.—Under the "Usury Law" the legislative intent was not to declare the whole contract void on account of usurious interest, but only the portion thereof relating to interest, and the forfeiture of principal is not authorized by the statute. (On petition for rehearing.)—Id.

23. CRIMINAL PROVISIONS—CONSTRUCTION.—Provisions of the "Usury Law" declaring the taking of usury a misdemeanor relate only to the question of interest and bear no relation whatever to the loan or repayment of the principal sum. (On denial of rehearing.)—Id.

24. COMPOUNDING OF INTEREST.—The contention that the "Usury Law" allows the compounding of interest, if not paid at the time provided for, as long as the limit of the rate of interest is maintained at twelve per cent per annum, cannot be maintained; but within the maximum limit the parties may contract freely in respect to interest and may compound it and also charge commission and bonuses, but such charges must, when added to the interest specified and spread over the whole period of forbearance, be kept within the limit set by the law; and in such case the WATERS AND WATER RIGHTS. 893

**USURY LAW (Continued).**

contract at the maximum rate may not provide for interest upon any unpaid installment when due, nor at the maximum rate may interest be lawfully collected in advance; and if interest is deducted in advance from the amount of the loan, in testing the transaction for usury the principal sum loaned will be held to be the amount of the loan less the interest or commission deducted in advance. (On denial of rehearing.)—Id.

25. **MAXIMUM INTEREST—TIME OF PAYMENT.**—No legal obligation exists to providing in a loan contract that it shall bear the maximum rate of interest, payable at the end of any particular period, such as monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, or annually, during the full period of forbearance, provided that such installments as fall due will be without accruing interest thereon, except upon a new contract and new consideration. (On denial of rehearing.)—Id.

26. **USURIOUS INTEREST—SUIT TO DECLARE FORFEITURE—TENDER—PLEADING.**—In a suit in equity where the extent of the prayer covers two subjects only, to wit: Forfeiture of interest and forfeiture of the right to declare the debt due until the full period of time contracted for has elapsed, plaintiff is not required to tender the principal sum and such other items, excluding interest, as might be due under the obligation before suit can be maintained. (On denial of rehearing.)—Id.

**WATERS AND WATER RIGHTS.**

1. **SEASONAL ACCRETIONS TO RIVER—CHARACTER OF.**—Seasonal accretions to the waters of a natural stream which are variable in quantity in the course of each and every year, being largest at times of heavy rainfall in the water-shed and also in the spring and summer by reason of melting snow in the mountains, which accretions are natural and regular, and occur in their usual expected and accustomed seasons, lasting through several months in the 894
WATERS AND WATER RIGHTS.

**WATERS AND WATER RIGHTS (Continued).**

annual change of seasons of every year, constitute the usual and ordinary flow of the stream and are in no sense "storm," "flood," "flagrant," or "enemy" waters, as these terms are used in law.—Herminghaus v. So. California Edison Co., 81.

2. **RIPARIAN OWNERS—RIGHT TO ACCRETIONS OF STREAM.**—Owners of lands riparian to a river are entitled to their riparian rights in the entire flow of the waters of the river considering the same with its seasonal accretions as the usual and ordinary flow of the stream during each and every year.—Id.

3. **SLOUGHS—RIPARIAN RIGHTS.**—Sloughs which take from a river at all stages and carry their water in well-defined channels, with banks and bottoms, to another slough, and other sloughs which take directly from the river at higher stages and likewise conduct their waters in similar channels to said slough, a distance of some miles, and other sloughs, having no mouths entering the river's banks, but taking water either by seepage from the main river or at times when the river overflows its adjoining banks, all of which sloughs conduct their waters in well-defined channels and which waters are never stationary but move in a current and have been doing so for many years, constitute legal watercourses; and the lands bordering on them are riparian lands which have a right to the flow of the water as it was, by nature, wont to flow, subject only to the reasonable use by riparian owners on the river at points above said lands.—Id.

4. **CONNECTION OF SLOUGHS WITH RIVER.**—The fact that sloughs make their connection with the main channel of a river at elevations which permit the waters thereof to enter the sloughs only when the increment in the water makes possible their passage, does not militate against their quality as watercourses.—Id.

5. **RIPARIAN OWNERS—RIGHTS IN STREAM—NATURE AND EXTENT OF.**—The rights of the riparian owners to the use of the waters of an abutting stream are paramount to the rights of any other persons thereto, and such rights are part and parcel of the land and any diminution of the stream against the will of the riparian owner by other persons is an actionable injury, an injury to the inheritance. The right to the flow of the water is inseparably annexed to the soil, and passes with it, not as an easement or appurtenant, but as a parcel. Use does not create, and disuse cannot destroy or suspend it. Each person through whose land a watercourse flows has (in common with those in like situation) an equal right to the benefit of it as it passes through his land, for all useful purposes to which it may be applied; and no appropriator of land on the same watercourse has a right unreasonably to divert it from flowing into his premises, or to obstruct it in passing from them, or to corrupt or destroy it. WATERS AND WATER RIGHTS. 895

**WATERS AND WATER RIGHTS (Continued).**

What is such reasonable use is a question of fact, and depends upon the circumstances appearing in each particular case.—Id.

6. **USE OF WATER—ARTIFICIAL CONTRIVANCES TO DIMINISH USE.**—The fact that owners of riparian lands might by artificial contrivances, through dams, ditches, and reservoirs, involving large expenditures of money, so interrupt or regulate the present natural flow of the river as to render a smaller quantity of its waters sufficient to satisfy the beneficial uses which they are now making of such waters in their entirety, cannot operate to limit or lessen their riparian rights to the uses of the water in their natural course.—Id.

7. **RIGHT TO UNDERFLOW OF STREAM.**—The rights of owners of agricultural land riparian to a river inhere not only in the upper flow of the waters which actually enters upon and permeates and fructifies the soil of the riparian lands, but also in the underflow of the river which lifts the upper flow thereof to the levels of entry upon such lands, and passes by to uplift the levels of lower riparian lands along the course of the river. The underflow of the stream is, with respect to riparian rights therein, no more waste waters than is the upper flow thereof which the riparian owner uses, since without the uplift of the former the outflow and beneficial use of the latter could not exist.—Id.

8. **USE OF WATER—DEVELOPMENT OF POWER.**—An owner of lands riparian to a stream is entitled to use the water, in addition to the customary use for domestic purposes and for irrigation of riparian lands, for the purpose of development of power and electric energy; subject, however, to the duty imposed on all riparian owners and users of water to make a present return of such waters to the course of the stream without undue waste or diminution.—Id.

9. **UPPER RIPARIAN OWNERS—IMPOUNDING OF WATER FOR PRODUCTION OF POWER.**—An upper riparian owner has no right to impound the waters of a river for the development of power and electric energy, where this would have the effect of causing a diversion of the waters which constitute the usual and ordinary flow of the river for periods and to an extent which would practically effectuate a withdrawal of said waters from a large portion of the lands of lower riparian owners during the period in each season when they are benefited by its flow and overflow.—Id.

10. **RIPARIAN RIGHTS—NATURE OF—COMMON LAW—PUBLIC POLICY.**—By the adoption of the common law in 1850, riparian rights became vested; and riparian owners are entitled to have the stream flow past their land in its usual course, which right, so far as it is of regular occurrence and beneficial to their lands, is a right of property which neither a court nor the legislature can deprive the 896
WATERS AND WATER RIGHTS.

WATERS AND WATER RIGHTS (Continued).

owner of upon the ground that the water may be more beneficially used by others.—Id.

11. UPPER RIPARIAN OWNERS—TAKING OF WATERS FOR POWER PURPOSES—CONTRACT OF THIRD PERSONS.—The fact that upper riparian owners, seeking to impound the waters of a river by a system of reservoirs, have entered into a contract with one owner of riparian lands, restricting them to a certain limited reservoiring of the water, dependent upon the consent of their co-contractors, cannot affect the rights of other riparian owners, not parties to the contract, to have the unobstructed natural flow of the water.—Id.

12. APPROPRIATION OF WATER—EFFECT OF.—It has long been settled in this state that an appropriation of water under the code divests no private existing right, but its effect is merely to give a preference over a subsequent appropriator or diverter who takes under no other right or title, and to fix the date of the posting of the notice as the inception of the claim under it.—Id.

13. SECTION 1419, CIVIL CODE—AMENDMENT OF 1911—CONSTRUCTION.—The amendment of 1911 to section 1410 of the Civil Code, with reference to the rights of appropriators of water, is not retroactive, and cannot operate to divest riparian rights already vested at the time it was enacted.—Id.

14. WATER COMMISSION ACT OF 1913—CONSTRUCTION OF.—Waters of a river which have been for a period of more than ten consecutive years last past, and are being, applied to useful and beneficial purposes upon lands riparian thereto, are not the proper subject of appropriation under section 11 of the Water Commission Act of 1913 (Stats. 1913, p. 1012).—Id.

15. DETERMINATION OF BENEFICIAL USE—POWER OF LEGISLATURE—WATER COMMISSION ACT—POLICE POWER.—The legislature has no right, under its police power, to determine what are the "useful and beneficial purposes" to which lands held in private ownership shall be devoted or the uses to which vested riparian rights which are an integral part thereof shall be limited, as declared in section 42 of the Water Commission Act.—Id.

16. RIGHTS OF LESSEE OF FEDERAL GOVERNMENT—NAVIGABLE WATERS.—The right to sequester and store a large quantity of the water of a navigable river, for the development of power and electric energy, to the detriment of lower riparian owners, is not supported by a claim that it is done in aid of navigation as lessee of the United States government, which is the owner of certain lands on the upper reaches of the river and its tributaries, where the United States government has not transferred to the lessee any right or power to be exercised in aid of navigation and the plan contemplates the diversion of large quantities of the water for indefinite periods.—Id. WILLS. 897
WATERS AND WATER RIGHTS (Continued).

17. ESTOPPEL—SUFFICIENCY OF EVIDENCE AND FINDINGS.—It is held in this action that the findings and conclusions of the trial court with reference to the plea of estoppel on the part of the plaintiffs to interfere with the appellant's alleged project and plans for the construction of its proposed system of reservoirs and storage plants sufficiently dealt with the matter and were sustained by the evidence.—Id.

WILLS.

1. ESTATES OF DECEASED PERSONS—TESTAMENTARY CAPACITY—HALLUCINATIONS—DELUSIONS.—Proof of the existence of hallucinations or delusions is not alone sufficient to annul a will unless such hallucinations or delusions bear directly upon the testamentary act.—Estate of McDonough, 57.

2. WILL CONTEST—UNSOUNDNESS OF MIND.—In a will contest upon the ground of unsoundness of mind of the testator, the question to be determined is not what might have been the mental condition of the testator, but what in fact was his mental condition at the time he made the will.—Id.

3. SUBSCRIBING WITNESSES—PRESUMPTIONS—OPINIONS.—The law presumes that the subscribing witnesses to the execution of a will had their attention drawn to and noted the mental capacity of the testator; and the opinions of such witnesses are entitled to more weight than that of one who is merely passive.—Id.

4. TESTAMENTARY CAPACITY—HARDENING OF ARTERIES.—It does not follow that testamentary capacity ceases with the approach of or even with the most advanced stages of arterial hardening; this condition or stage in life is but partial evidence to be considered in connection with other evidence in determining whether or not arteriosclerosis has shut off the blood supply to the brain to the extent that the mind is unable to correctly function.—Id.

5. COMPETENCY—EVIDENCE.—In considering the question of a testator's competency, the issue does not rest upon the contestant's evidence alone, but the testimony of proponent's witnesses must be taken into consideration in weighing the sufficiency of the contestant's case; and evidence which standing by itself might be sufficient to sustain a verdict may in the light of all the facts be wholly inadequate, and that without invading the province of the jury as the judges of the weight and sufficiency of the evidence.—Id.

6. INSUFFICIENCY OF EVIDENCE.—In this will contest it is held that the evidence is insufficient to sustain the judgment.—Id.

7. PETITION FOR REVOCATION OF PROBATE OF WILL—EVIDENCE.—In this proceeding for the revocation of the probate of a will, it is held that the trial court exercised a reasonable control over the examina-

WILLS (Continued).

tion of witnesses, and that although certain rulings excluding evidence, standing alone, might properly be held erroneous, when considered in the light of the evidence elsewhere admitted they were not prejudicial.—Estate of Haupt, 147.

8. ALLEGED FRAUD AND UNDUE INFLUENCE—INSUFFICIENCY OF EVIDENCE.—It is held in this proceeding for the revocation of a will that there is nothing in the evidence that even tends to savor of fraud or undue influence and that the uncontradicted evidence was ample to establish that the will as executed was in complete accord with the decedent's wishes and expressed desires. Id.

9. WITNESSES—OFFICIAL OF BANK.—The mere fact that the decedent was a customer of a bank which was appointed as executor of her estate, and of which a witness of the will was an official, would not support an inference of undue influence in the execution of the will.—Id.

10. TESTAMENTARY CAPACITY—EVIDENCE.—It is held in this proceeding for the revocation of the probate of a will that the contention that the presumption of sanity of the testatrix was overcome by substantial evidence and that the issue of testamentary capacity should therefore have been submitted to the jury for determination cannot be sustained.—Id.

11. SUBSCRIBING WITNESSES—QUALIFICATION OF EXECUTOR.—A person named as executor in a will may properly serve as a subscribing witness, and the fact that a bank is appointed as executor of a will and to act as trustee of the estate after final distribution does not disqualify employees of the bank from being subscribing witnesses to the will.—Id.

12. TESTAMENTARY CAPACITY—EVIDENCE.—The actual mental condition of the decedent at the time of the execution of his will is the question to be determined upon a contest of the will based on his alleged incompetency, and evidence tending to show unsoundness of mind, either before or after the execution of the will, is important only in so far as it tends to show mental condition at the time of the execution of the will; and to overcome the presumption of sanity the contestant must show affirmatively and by a preponderance of the evidence that the testator was of unsound mind at the time he executed his will.—Estate of Smith, 152.

13. MENTAL DERANGEMENT—CHARACTER OF.—Mental derangement sufficient to invalidate a will must be insanity in one of two forms: (1) insanity of such broad character as to establish mental incompetency generally, or (2) some specific and narrower form of insanity under which the testator is the victim of some hallucination or delusion; and even in the latter class of cases the evidence must establish that the will itself was the creature or product of such hallucination or delusion.—Id. WILLS. 899
WILLS (Continued).

14. TESTAMENTARY CAPACITY—TEST.—A testator is of sound and disposing mind and memory if, at the time of making his will, he has sufficient mental capacity to be able to understand the nature of the act he is doing, to understand and recollect the nature and situation of his property and to remember, and understand, his relations to the persons who have claims upon his bounty and whose interests are affected by the provisions of the instrument.—Id.

15. WILL CONTEST—UNSOUNDNESS OF MIND—UNDUE INFLUENCE—INSUFFICIENCY OF EVIDENCE.—In this will contest it is held that the evidence was not sufficient to establish that the testator was incompetent at the time that he executed his will, or to warrant an inference that he was induced to make the will as the result of the undue influence of the sole beneficiary.—Id.

16. DEFINITION OF UNDUE INFLUENCE—EVIDENCE.—Undue influence is defined to be the exercise of acts or conduct by one person toward another person by means of which the mind of the latter is subjected to the will of the person seeking to control it, and in order to establish that the will has been executed under undue influence it is necessary to show, not only that such influence has been exercised, but also that it has produced an effect upon the mind of the testator by which the will which he executes is not the expression of his own desires; and the presumption of undue influence is not raised by proof of interest and opportunity alone, but there must be substantial proof of pressure which overpowered the volition of the testator at the time the will was made.—Id.

17. UNNATURAL WILL—Presumptions.—The fact that the will of a testator may be unnatural, unfair, or unjust creates of itself no presumption that the decedent was incompetent or that the instrument was procured by undue influence; nor does it shift the burden of proof to the proponent.—Id.

18. FAIRNESS AND JUSTNESS OF WILL.—A will disinheriting the widow of the deceased and devising all of the estate to a friend cannot be said to be unfair, unjust or unnatural, where it is shown that the testator and the sole beneficiary had been intimate friends for many years; that decedent was solicitous of the beneficiary's well-being and had often loaned him money for various purposes; that he had even expressed the desire and willingness to assist the beneficiary in acquiring his own home, and that the beneficiary had cared for the decedent in his last illness; and it further appeared that the decedent and his wife, the contestant, had experienced certain matrimonial difficulties which terminated in the filing of a divorce action by the contestant, which action proved abortive, but the parties had never resumed marital relations thereafter, and the decedent had stated that the contestant had sufficient property in her own name.—Id. 900

19. REMARKS OF COURT—LACK OF PREJUDICE.—In this will contest it is held that the contestant was not injured as a result of the trial court's declaration that he was not assisted in the determination of the cause by the testimony of a certain doctor and that the introduction of similar expert testimony would therefore tend to "waste time," the court not having precluded the contestant from introducing further expert testimony; and it is further held that the rulings of the court excluding certain testimony of doctors as being privileged within the provisions of subdivision 4 of section 1881 of the Code of Civil Procedure were correct.—Id.

20. HOLOGRAPHIC WILL—EXECUTION—EVIDENCE.—The signature to a holographic will, wherever it is placed in the will, is sufficient if it is evident from an inspection of the whole document itself that it was the intent of the testator it should serve as a token of execution; but it must appear from the face of the instrument that it is a complete and executed document.—Estate of Morgan, 400.

WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION ACT.

1. LOSS OF REMAINING EYE—PERMANENT DISABILITY.—Where an employee has previously lost the sight of one of his eyes, the loss of his remaining eye by an industrial accident results in a condition contemplated by section 9 of the Workmen's Compensation Act requiring a permanent disability rating.—Liptak v. Industrial Acc. Com., 39.

2. STATUTORY CONSTRUCTION.—Where a provision of the Workmen's Compensation Act is susceptible of an interpretation either beneficial or detrimental to an injured employee, the court is called upon, under the provisions of section 69, to adopt the construction beneficial to such employee.—Id.

3. EMPLOYER AND EMPLOYEE—INJURY TO EMPLOYEE—PAYMENT OF COMPENSATION BY INSURANCE CARRIER—SUBROGATION.—Under the Workmen's Compensation Act (sec. 30, subd. 2 (f)), when an employer is insured against liability for compensation, and the carrier has paid any compensation for which the employer is liable, or furnished or provided any medical services required by the act, such insurance carrier is subrogated to all the rights of the employer, and may enforce such rights in its own name.—Morris v. Standard Oil Co., 210. WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION ACT. 901
WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION ACT (Continued).

4. **Lien of Insurance Carrier—Assignability.**—A lien for the amount of the compensation paid an injured employee by an insurance carrier of the employer, allowed under the provision of section 26 of the Workmen's Compensation Act against a judgment for personal injuries recovered by the employee against the person causing the injuries, is assignable.—Id.

5. **Choses in Action—Assignability—Section 954, Civil Code.**—Section 954 of the Civil Code has effected a change in the common-law rule of nonassignability of choses in action, and one arising either out of violation of a right of property or out of an obligation or contract may now be transferred.—Id.

6. **Compensation to Employee—Reimbursement of Employer of Insurance Carrier—Nature of Cause of Action.**—A cause of action for reimbursement of an employer, or its subrogated insurance carrier, for the amount of disability indemnity paid an employee, is not one arising in favor of the employee by reason of his injuries, but out of the obligation imposed by the Workmen's Compensation Act on the party who caused the injury to the employee, and is a property injury to the employer.—Id.

7. **Statute of Limitations—Statutory Liability—Time.**—Such a cause of action being based upon a liability created by statute may be commenced within three years from the time the insurance carrier paid the disability indemnity to the injured employee.—Id.

8. **Overexertion in High Altitude—Compensable Injury.**—Upon an application for compensation for the death of an employee, where the Industrial Accident Commission finds that the death was caused by acute dilatation of the heart and that said condition was due to a previous diseased condition being precipitated by the employee's situation in a higher altitude than that to which he had long been accustomed, and the evidence shows that such exposure was connected with a marked degree of overexertion at such higher altitude and was immediately attendant upon the occupation of the employee at the time of his heart attack, it is error to conclude that the injury is not compensable.—Knock v. Industrial Acc. Com., 456.

9. **"Precipitation" of Crisis.**—The term "precipitation" means to hasten the occurrence of an event; and where an employee's death, although arising from an existing heart trouble, is found to have been "precipitated" by overexertion in the course of his employment, an industrial liability exists.—Id.

10. **Findings—Evidence.**—In such a case, if a finding of the Industrial Accident Commission that "said situation and precipitation did not constitute an injury arising out of the employment" is a finding of ultimate fact, it cannot be sustained under the un- 902 WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION ACT.

WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION ACT (Continued).

disputed evidence, and if it is a conclusion of law, it is not sustained under the authorities.—Id.

11. EMPLOYER AND EMPLOYEE—CONTRACT OF EMPLOYMENT—JURISDICTION.—Where a contract of employment is made in the state of California, the employer and the employee are subject to the provisions of the Workmen's Compensation Law of this state, although the injuries complained of occurred outside the state.—Alaska Packers Assn. v. Industrial Acc. Com., 579.

12. NATURE OF CONTRACT.—A contract employing one as a member of the crew of a bark bound for Alaska, where the employee engaged in catching fish for a cannery, is maritime in its nature.—Id.

13. CHARACTER OF WORK—EFFECT ON CONTRACT.—In such a case, the fact that the employee worked at mending nets, performed services in loading and unloading lighters carrying the cargo of the ship, and, part of the time while the vessel was in Alaska, slept on shore, did not qualify in any way the nature of his contract, or render it severable.—Id.

14. MARITIME CONTRACTS—MARITIME LAW—STATE REGULATIONS.—Generally speaking, parties entering into maritime contracts contemplate the system of maritime law and its well-known rules control their rights and liabilities, to the exclusion of state statutes; but, as to certain local matters, regulation of which works no material prejudice to the general maritime law, nor interferes with the proper harmony or uniformity of that law in its international or interstate relations, the rules of the maritime law may be modified or supplemented by state regulation.—Id.

15. COMPENSATION ACT—STATUTORY CONSTRUCTION.—When a compensation act supersedes other state laws touching a liability for damages which depended upon the common law and state statutes, it does not come into conflict with any superior maritime law; and this is true whether the award under the act is made as upon an implied agreement or otherwise.—Id.

16. COMPENSATION FOR INJURIES—ABROGATION OF COMMON LAW.—The California Workmen's Compensation Act provides the only means by which an injured employee can recover compensation from his employer for injuries received in the course of and arising out of his employment, and it abrogates common-law liability of the master for such injuries in the cases to which it is applicable.—Id.

17. MARITIME CONTRACTS—INJURY OF EMPLOYER ON LAND—LOCAL LAW.—Although a person was employed by a contract made here to go as a seaman to Alaska waters for the purpose of catching fish for a cannery, a claim made by him for injuries received while standing on the beach, pushing and lifting on a fishing ZONING.                                                                 903

boat in an endeavor to launch it, comes within the compensation law of this state.—Id.

18. EMPLOYEES—SEAMEN.—While seamen and fishermen may not usually be referred to as "employees," there can be no question but that they come within the broad meaning of this word as used in section 8 of the Workmen's Compensation Act.—Id.
