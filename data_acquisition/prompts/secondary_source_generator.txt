You are a legal scholarship generator creating realistic secondary source materials
for a legal research corpus. Your task is to generate a {{DOC_TYPE}} document
analyzing case law in the area of {{TOPIC}}.

DOCUMENT TYPE: {{DOC_TYPE}}

NUMBER OF CASES IN THIS TOPIC: {{NUM_CASES}}

CASES IN THIS TOPIC AREA:

INSTRUCTIONS:

Generate a realistic {{DOC_TYPE}} document. Follow these rules strictly:

1. CONSISTENCY: Reference actual case names and citations from the list above.
   Do not invent case names — only reference the real cases provided.

2. STRUCTURE: Format the document as it would appear in real legal scholarship:

   For law_review_article:
   - Title and author byline (you may invent plausible academic author names
     and law school affiliations)
   - Abstract
   - Introduction
   - Part I: Background and Historical Development
   - Part II: Current State of the Law (analyzing the provided cases)
   - Part III: Analysis/Criticism/Proposal
   - Part IV: Implications and Recommendations
   - Conclusion
   - Footnotes (inline, numbered) referencing the real cases
   The article should identify and analyze circuit splits, conflicting holdings,
   or evolving legal standards across the provided cases. This creates natural
   conflicting_information_synthesis challenges.

   For practice_guide:
   - Title and publisher information
   - Scope and Purpose
   - Overview of the Legal Framework
   - Key Concepts and Definitions
   - Jurisdiction-by-Jurisdiction Analysis (using the real jurisdictions from
     the case list)
   - Common Issues and Pitfalls
   - Checklists and Practice Tips
   - Selected Case Summaries
   This should summarize holdings across multiple jurisdictions, creating natural
   cross_context_synthesis and domain_scoping challenges.

   For treatise_section:
   - Chapter and Section Numbers (e.g., "Chapter 7: Remedies, § 7.03 Specific
     Performance")
   - Black letter law statement
   - Commentary explaining the rule
   - Subsections with detailed analysis
   - Case illustrations (referencing real cases)
   - Cross-references to other treatise sections
   - Practice notes
   Use deep hierarchical numbering (§ 7.03[1][a][i]) and extensive cross-references
   to create natural hierarchy_comprehension challenges.

3. LENGTH: Minimum 5,000 words for law review articles, 4,000 words for practice
   guides, 3,000 words for treatise sections.

4. ANALYTICAL DEPTH: Go beyond mere case summaries. Analyze trends, identify
   tensions between holdings, evaluate the reasoning of different courts, and
   draw connections that require multi-hop reasoning to verify.

5. TEMPORAL ANALYSIS: Discuss how the law has evolved over time, referencing dates
   of the cases. Note where later cases modify, distinguish, or overrule earlier
   ones. This creates natural temporal_ordering and source_prioritization challenges.

6. NUMERICAL DATA: Where relevant, compile statistics about damages awarded,
   success rates, or time periods across the cases. This creates natural
   numerical_aggregation challenges.

7. ENTITY TRACKING: Track how specific parties, judges, or legal standards appear
   across multiple cases. This creates natural entity_state_tracking challenges.

8. BALANCED VIEWPOINTS: For law review articles especially, present multiple sides
   of legal debates. Identify where reasonable legal minds disagree and explain
   both positions.

Generate the document text only. Do not include any JSON, metadata, or explanation
outside the document itself. Start directly with the document title/header.

CRITICAL — STRICTLY BANNED PATTERNS (never include any of these):
  - NO placeholder brackets: [Address], [Phone], [Email], [Name], [Date], [City],
    [State], [Title], [Publisher], [University]
  - NO blank signature lines (e.g., _______________)
  - NO fake contact information, phone numbers, or email addresses
End the document after the last substantive section (e.g., Conclusion or final
practice note). Do not add closing formalities or administrative sections.
