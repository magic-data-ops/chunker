INSTRUCTIONS:

Generate a realistic {{DOC_TYPE}} document. Follow these rules strictly:

1. CONSISTENCY: Use the exact party names, judge names, case names, and statutory
   references provided above. Do not invent new entities — only reference entities
   from the provided context.

2. CITATION ACCURACY: When citing cases, use the exact citation strings provided.
   When referencing related cases, use their proper case names and citations.

3. NUMERICAL ACCURACY: If the document involves monetary amounts (e.g., settlement
   agreements, damages claims), use values consistent with the numerical facts
   provided above. You may use round numbers close to the actual figures.

4. STRUCTURE: Format the document as it would appear in real legal practice:

   For plaintiff_brief / defendant_brief:
   - Caption (case name, court, docket number)
   - Table of Contents
   - Statement of Issues
   - Statement of Facts
   - Argument (with numbered sections citing cases and statutes)
   - Conclusion

   For motion_summary_judgment:
   - Caption
   - Introduction
   - Statement of Undisputed Material Facts
   - Legal Standard
   - Argument
   - Conclusion

   For motion_discovery:
   - Caption
   - Introduction
   - Factual Background
   - Discovery Requests or Objections
   - Legal Analysis
   - Conclusion

   For settlement_agreement:
   - Parties and Recitals
   - Definitions
   - Settlement Amount and Payment Terms
   - Releases and Waivers
   - Representations and Warranties
   - Confidentiality
   - Miscellaneous Provisions
   End after Miscellaneous Provisions. Do NOT add signature blocks or notarization.

   For court_order:
   - Caption
   - Background
   - Legal Standard
   - Analysis
   - Order/Disposition
   End after the Order/Disposition section. Do NOT add a judge signature line.

5. LENGTH: The document should be substantial — at minimum 3,000 words for briefs
   and motions, 2,000 words for settlement agreements and court orders. Include
   enough detail to be realistic.

6. ARGUMENTATION: For briefs, present genuine legal arguments that reference the
   holdings and reasoning from the real court opinion. The plaintiff brief should
   argue one side, the defendant brief the other. Both should cite overlapping
   but different sets of cases.

7. CROSS-REFERENCES: Reference specific paragraphs, pages, or sections of the
   court opinion where relevant (e.g., "As the court noted in its discussion of
   the standard of review...").

8. CONTENT BOUNDARIES: End each document after its final substantive section:
   briefs/motions end at "Conclusion", court orders end at "Order/Disposition",
   settlement agreements end at "Miscellaneous Provisions". Do not write anything
   after these sections.

Generate the document text only. Do not include any JSON, metadata, or explanation
outside the document itself. Start directly with the document header/caption.

CRITICAL — READ THIS CAREFULLY: The following patterns are STRICTLY BANNED and must
NEVER appear anywhere in the document. Violating any of these rules makes the output
unusable:

  - NO signature blocks ("Respectfully submitted", "/s/", "Attorney for...")
  - NO placeholder brackets: [Address], [Phone], [Email], [Name], [Law Firm],
    [Date], [City], [State], [Fax], [Title], [Counsel for...], [JUDGE SIGNATURE]
  - NO blank signature lines (e.g., _______________)
  - NO bar numbers or bar references ("Bar No.", "State Bar #")
  - NO notarization sections ("STATE OF ___ / COUNTY OF ___", "Notary Public",
    "sworn and subscribed", "My commission expires")
  - NO certificate of service sections
  - NO fake attorney names, addresses, phone numbers, fax numbers, or email addresses
  - NO "SO ORDERED" followed by a judge signature line

End the document IMMEDIATELY after the last paragraph of substantive legal analysis.
Do not add any closing formalities, signature blocks, or administrative sections.
