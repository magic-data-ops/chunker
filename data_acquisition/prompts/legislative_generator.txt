You are a legal document generator creating realistic legislative materials for a
legal research corpus. Your task is to generate a {{DOC_TYPE}} document related
to a specific statute that has been interpreted in court cases.

DOCUMENT TYPE: {{DOC_TYPE}}
STATUTE: {{STATUTE_CODE}}
NUMBER OF COURT CASES INTERPRETING THIS STATUTE: {{NUM_CASES}}

CASES THAT INTERPRET OR REFERENCE THIS STATUTE:
{{RELATED_CASES}}

---

INSTRUCTIONS:

Generate a realistic {{DOC_TYPE}} document related to {{STATUTE_CODE}}. Follow
these rules strictly:

1. CONSISTENCY: Reference the exact statute code provided. When mentioning court
   interpretations, reference the actual case names and citations from the list above.

2. STRUCTURE: Format the document as it would appear in real legislative/regulatory
   practice:

   For statutory_text:
   - Full statutory section with section number
   - Definitions subsection
   - Substantive provisions with lettered/numbered subsections
   - Exceptions and exemptions
   - Penalties/remedies provisions
   - Effective date provisions
   - Cross-references to related statutory sections
   The text should be detailed with nested subsections (a), (b), (c) etc., and
   sub-subsections (1), (2), (3), reflecting real statutory complexity.

   For committee_report:
   - Committee name and session
   - Purpose and summary
   - Background and need for legislation
   - Section-by-section analysis
   - Cost estimate
   - Regulatory impact assessment
   - Dissenting/additional views (if applicable)
   Include specific policy rationale explaining WHY the statute was written as it
   was, including compromises and competing interests.

   For floor_debate:
   - Date and chamber identification
   - Multiple speakers (Senator/Representative names — you may invent plausible names)
   - Opening remarks by bill sponsor
   - Supporting arguments from proponents
   - Opposition arguments from critics
   - Response and rebuttal
   - Procedural motions
   Include genuine disagreements about the statute's scope, potential for abuse,
   economic impact, and constitutional concerns.

   For regulatory_guidance:
   - Agency name and date
   - Purpose and scope
   - Background (statutory authority)
   - Interpretive guidance with numbered sections
   - Examples and illustrations
   - Applicability/effective date
   - Contact information
   The guidance should explain how the agency interprets ambiguous provisions in
   the statute, potentially differing from some court interpretations listed above.

3. LENGTH: Minimum 3,000 words for statutory text and committee reports, 4,000
   words for floor debates, 2,500 words for regulatory guidance.

4. LEGAL REALISM: The content should reflect genuine policy tensions and legal
   complexities that real statutes embody. Reference specific problems the statute
   was designed to address.

5. CROSS-REFERENCES TO CASE LAW: Reference how courts have interpreted specific
   provisions, noting where judicial interpretation may diverge from legislative
   intent. This creates natural source_prioritization and conflicting_information
   challenges.

6. HIERARCHICAL STRUCTURE: Use proper legislative formatting with nested sections,
   subsections, and cross-references. This creates natural hierarchy_comprehension
   challenges.

Generate the document text only. Do not include any JSON, metadata, or explanation
outside the document itself. Start directly with the document header.
